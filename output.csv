Your comments will allow us to clarify the points below and significantly improve the quality of our manuscript! Re Q1: Yes indeed we use standardized genotypes for the purpose of having a simple toy figure. The main point we try to convey is that multiple causal effect size configurations can lead to the same observed marginal effects in GWAS. Thus, given GWAS data only, our approach proposes to sample across these causal configurations to estimate heritabilities. As with all toy figures, there is a balance between oversimplification and leading to misinterpretations; we will clarify this better in the legend/text. Re Q2: First, indeed we make the assumption that the true causal effects \beta are independent across SNPs; this is a standard assumption that is made across most heritability work in human genetics and likely a good approximation in real data. That being said, we can drop this assumption then an extra covariance term exists (see bottom pp17) that could potentially be estimated/investigated; here we focus only on the \beta’R\beta term (our estimand of interest). Second, as you clarify and we are in full agreement,  the posterior samples have a covariance structure that is different from identity; i.e. \beta_i and \beta_j post samples are correlated. In the most simple case of the toy example of Fig 1 with two SNPs in perfect LD and with a sparsity model that only allows 1 causal, only one of the \beta’s will have non-zero effect in any configuration; therefore the two betas in the posterior are negatively correlated (r=-1). Or in the case of full infinitesimal model with independence of beta as prior, one can also straightforwardly derive the variance of the posterior as 1/n (1/(1-h2)R + M/(Nh2) I )^-1 (with apologies for self reference see https://www.biorxiv.org/con... or multiple other previous works with similar derivations). In the more general case when there is also a sparsity prior, an analytical solution for the posterior is hard to derive; this motivated us to sample from the posterior of \beta in this work. Third, as defined in pp 17-18, our estimand of interest is \beta’R\beta where \beta are the unknown causal effects (also denoted as h2gene). We rely on an approximation of the posterior of \beta from SuSiE to sample from posterior effects and then approximate a sampling from posterior of \beta’R\beta  (pp19); our proposed estimator has the simple form of avg (\beta’R\beta), where the average is taken across samples from posterior (samples that will have correlations across SNPs, as noted above). We fully acknowledge that other estimators for \beta’R\beta can be proposed (analytical and/or sampling based) that could be potentially more efficient and/or unbiased. In this work we chose to focus on this simple estimator that works reasonably well in simulations and real data. We will revise to clarify all these points!",2021-08-24T17:44:27,bogdanpasaniuc,Bogdan Pasaniuc,10.1101/2021.08.17.456722,Partitioning gene-level contributions to complex-trait heritability by allele frequency identifies disease-relevant genes,"Kathryn S.

Additive genetic variance at a single bi-allelic locus under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is 2pq\beta^2, not just \beta^2, where p and q are allele frequencies and \beta is allele substitution effect. In general, this is 2pq(1+F)\beta^2, where F measures deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. So, genetic variance and heritability at a locus depend on variance of genotypes and allele effects (classic reference for this is Falconer and MacKay, 1996). Hmm, are you skipping variance of genotypes, Var(x), because you standardise your genotypes (which changes what \beta mean)? When you expand to a region, linkage-disequilibrium between loci within the region also kicks in. Also the region will be correlated to other regions, so variance partitioning is not really that meaningful looking just one region or locus at a time. You account for linkage-disequilibrium with your R matrix. But, when working with regions, correlation between estimates of \beta_i and \beta_j also kick in, even though we assume apriori that \beta_i and \beta_j are independent. Your derivation on page 17 works on the prior side, but does this also hold when you work with posteriors of \beta - they are quite correlated and possibly also correlated with genotypes (x) too? We have been doing something similar, but focusing on the whole genome and partitioning additive genetic variance by chromosome (=region of a genome) https://www.biorxiv.org/con....

Question (if comments here do get seen/answered): Considering that only 10 MC to MC connections were tested compared to the larger sample sizes of MC to PV, VIP, and L1 INT connections tested (with low connection probabilities), is it fair to say that MC to MC connections do not occur (at least in mouse somatosensory cortex)? Given the low connection probability of MC to other interneurons, it seems in the realm of possibility that 10 MC to MC connections might not be enough to confidently say this. I ask because I've seen work at conferences in the past showing that these types of connections can and do occur (not sure if it's been published - I think it was for OLM cells in hippocampus).",2021-08-19T16:39:39,agmccrei,Alex GM,10.1101/2021.08.16.455953,Molecular signature and target-specificity of inhibitory circuits formed by Martinotti cells in the mouse barrel cortex,"Cristina Donato, Carolina Cabezas, Andrea Aguirre, Joana Lourenço, Marie-Claude Potier, Javier Zorrilla de San Martin, Alberto Bacci",2021-08-17

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.14.456176v1#comment-5500367333,biorxivstage,1,"We have recently reported that the Tn5-based epigenomic profiling methods, especially Stacc-seq and CoBATCH, are prone to open chromatin bias ( https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.09.451758v1). Rather than directly address this bias issue, the authors of Stacc-seq argued in this preprint that FC-I normalization (normalizing by input/IgG control) was better than FC-C (normalizing by background) for Stacc-seq etc. data analysis. Based on this, they claimed that our results had “a major analysis issue”. However, the truth is that we had already used both FC-I and FC-C normalization methods and both showed clear open chromatin bias for Stacc-seq and CoBATCH. The fact that our analyses demonstrating that CUT&Tag (5% FPR) showed much lower FPR than Stacc-seq (30% FPR) or CoBATCH (50% FPR) indicated that the high FPRs were not due to “artificially enhanced the relative enrichment of potential open chromatin bias”, but an intrinsic problem of Stacc-seq and CoBATCH. In our opinion, the preprint has several problems, which are detailed below. 1.	The preprint ignored the fact that we had already used both FC-I and FC-C normalization methods. The authors assumed that we only used FC-C for Stacc-seq etc. (Fig. 1A in Liu et al.). However, in fact we used both FC-C and FC-I in our analyses. In Fig. 1c, d and Fig. S2 of our manuscript (Wang et al.), methods labeled with “with IgG” were results from FC-I normalization, and methods without such label were results from FC-C normalization. Importantly, results from both normalizing methods showed clear open chromatin bias for Stacc-seq and CoBATCH (Fig. 1c,d and Fig. S2 in Wang et al.). 2.	The results of global H3K27me3 enrichment at the Polycomb targets in this preprint (Fig. 1C) was contradictory to their claim that using FC-C would cause “complete loss or dramatic reduction of enrichment at true targets for datasets generated by Tn5-based methods”. Fig. 1C of this preprint showed a clear H3K27me3 enrichment around the TSS of Polycomb targets compared to adjacent regions when using FC-C. The difference between results from FC-I and FC-C is caused by the y-scale. The fold change is a relative measurement, so the y-scale of different normalization methods is not directly comparable. If they set the y-scale of FC-C to 0~2, the enrichment pattern would be highly similar to that using FC-I. 3.	The genome browser snapshots of several loci in a large scale (low resolution) could not demonstrate that the results from FC-I and FC-C normalization are globally different. This preprint provided several example loci (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2 in Liu et al.) to show that using FC-C would cause “complete loss or dramatic reduction of enrichment at true targets for datasets generated by Tn5-based methods”. However, showing browser view of very large regions are misleading as the resolution is too low. For genome browser display, the look of the signal track patterns depends on y-scale, x-scale and windowing and smoothing function. When viewing a very large region, the signals are sampled and aggregated by genome browser and are not the raw signals. Thus, the patterns may not reflect the real situation. Indeed, when zoomed-in to check these regions, we found the peak patterns from FC-I and FC-C normalization are highly similar. In addition, examples from several loci could not reflect the global pattern. The global enrichment shown in Fig. 1C of this preprint did not support their conclusion, as discussed in point 2. In summary, our original analysis has already included the normalization method suggested by the authors of this preprint. Results from both normalization methods supported that Stacc-seq and CoBATCH had high open chromatin bias. In fact, the results from this preprint also support our conclusions. In Fig. 2 of this preprint, regardless whether FC-I, FC-C or RPKM were used, the discrete peaks from Stacc-seq etc. were more similar to ATAC-seq peaks, but were totally different from ChIP-seq peaks.

Nevertheless, I was sharing my cat’s results with my vet, and I thought that I should mention the following: a) Do you think you could make a barplot that sums to 100% for various intervals (such as every 5% of scores or maybe whatever rounds to nice values for the scores)? For example, I think the density plots in Figure 3 of this preprint were helpful to share with the vet, but I think the absolute numbers from Figure 1 were also important to communicate. b) If using the barplot strategy, then I think I would want to see the 5 categories from Figure 1 as a possible way to gauge the Positive Predictive Value in new batches of samples (for each of the 3 scores). I think the basic idea is to gauge the impact of other samples that may change the overall frequency of healthy cats (which could in turn affect the positive predictive value).

These updates are going to be really helpful for clarity. To briefly answer: 1) The days listed in figure 1 refer to individually aligned day of estrous cycle - so they aren't actually all exactly the same p day because the animals don't cycle exactly in sync with one another. 2) My understanding is that this is a matter of stylistic preference; I typically see it in figures (like this one) with a large number of subpanels. I suppose the reviewers will decide if they like these summaries or not, and that will likely determine their inclusion or exclusion :) 3) The colored arrows in figure 2 are merely meant to indicate that the x-axis label ""Day of Life"" applies to the figures both to the left and to the right. The arrows could be made black if this is distracting; I was trying to indicate the figures being referred to by matching the arrows to the color of the group. 4) These were Mann Kendall trend over time tests; this is described in the text but perhaps should be called out in the legend as well.

Lot of GWAS studies have revealed that a few variants like rs1421085 in FTO non-coding region are highly associated with obesity. However, none of these variants has been functionally validated in vivo due to tremendous difficulties and huge costs. In this study, the authors firstly demonstrated that a single rs1421085 variant T>C in the non-coding area was a functional point and the mutation from T to C could boost thermogenesis in global knock-in and BAT specific knock-in mice. Mechanistically, T>C mutation could enhance FTO gene expression, which in some way, boost UCP1 expression.  Furthermore, based on the frequency of this mutation in different population around the world, the authors proposed a very intriguing hypothesis that this mutation with increased thermogenesis capacity help human to adapt to coldness, thus in certain way facilitating human to migrate out Africa and spread all the world. This study gives us some fresh view that the SNPs identified from GWAS are functional and that GWAS is an effective way to identify genetic factors for complex diseases. However, there are some concerns. Since this point localizes in non-coding region, which is usually not conserved across species, how the authors could prove this be true in humans? Except FTO, does this variant affect other known important genes like IRX3 and IRX5, or more thermogenesis related genes?

During the first five days after the first dose of an mRNA vaccine, tiny amounts [~30 pg/mL (171.43 fM)] of spike protein could be detected in circulation (Ogata et al., 2021). Most of the spike remains attached to the cell’s surface and does not disperse much from the injection site. Interestingly, the spike was no longer detected in circulation after the second dose, thanks to the antibodies generated with the first dose that quickly and effectively removed the tiny amounts of spike that manage to reach the circulation. In contrast, in our study, the effective concentration of the spike to cause endothelial inflammation was ~1 .6 nM [~300’000 pg/mL], which is a possible concentration in COVID19, where real endothelial damage occurs. Hence, our insights are limited to the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, almost 2’500 million people have been vaccinated until now, and less than 0.001% of the cases present problems. Moreover, vaccination produces antibodies that help deplete spike from circulation, which could help prevent endothelial damage in COVID19. So, in a few words, vaccination is very safe and can even help prevent spike-induced endothelial damage. So, even though inflammatory properties could be attributed to spike, it is still the best antigen to train our immune system to protect us from COVID19.

There are a few questions regarding the architecture and the benchmark study. 1. What is the loss function of RGN2 (i.e. loss function for the output of the geometry module). Is it the same as RGN1, i.e. dRMSD, or a new loss function that can distinguish mirrored structures. 2. The performance of RGN1 is highly dependent on the random seed used to initialize the training. Is this still the case for RGN2? In other words, for the same testing protein, if we use two RGN2 models trained on the same training set but different random initialization, what is the GDT_TS between the two resulting structure models? 3. What is the accuracy of predicted theta and phi? This question is similar to a comment on the RGN1 paper ( https://www.biorxiv.org/con... which was not fully explored. It is likely that including an auxiliary loss for theta and phi can not only improve local structure correctness but also resolve the chirality issue, which was not addressed by the dRMSD loss. 4. Both RGN1 and RGN2 construct the peptide chain in torsion space, i.e. Ramachandran angles for RGN1;  a bond angle phi and a torsion angle theta for RGN2.  As pointed out by a recent preprint ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2105...., ""One well-known problem is that internal coordinates are extremely sensitive to small deviations as the latter easily propagate through the protein, generating large errors in the reconstructed structure."" Is there an attempt to address this issue? 5. RGN2 is trained on ASTRAL domains, most of which are ""normal"" proteins that are neither orphan nor designed proteins. Therefore, the single-sequence structure prediction performance difference between RGN2 and third-party programs (AlphaFold2, RoseTTaFold and trRosetta) should be comparable regardless of whether the testing proteins are orphan or not, provide that only a single sequence rather than MSAs is fed to the three third-party programs. On non-orphan proteins, e.g. CASP14 FM targets that are not used in RGN2 training, can RGN2 still outperform single-sequence-based AlphaFold2, RoseTTaFold and trRosetta?",2021-08-08T23:50:11,chengxinzhang,Chengxin Zhang,10.1101/2021.08.02.454840,Single-sequence protein structure prediction using language models from deep learning,"Ratul Chowdhury, Nazim Bouatta, Surojit Biswas, Charlotte Rochereau, George M.

We believe that we address many of these concerns in the manuscript and supplemental materials and we are happy to address them again here. To our knowledge, possible artifacts include carry-over effects, irreversible aggregation, and EX1-like behavior. Our results are reproducible (highlighted in figure 2C though we acknowledge we can and should include more demonstrations of reproducibility in our next draft) despite samples being injected in random order, which is not consistent with a carry-over effect. We demonstrate reversibility (figure 2C, supplemental figure 3C), proving this is not irreversible aggregation. And our observed bimodal distributions have a fixed ratio during continuous-labeling time courses at 25C (supplemental figure 3A/B), which is not classic EX1 or EXX behavior, but is most consistent with two structurally distinct, slowly interconverting forms undergoing EX2 exchange. Some might call this sort of sample heterogeneity an “artifact”, but this heterogeneity is exactly what we are aiming to characterize in this manuscript. In regard to this being an artifact specific to our sample, in our manuscript we report this reversible bimodal behavior for three variants of the spike protein prepared in two different labs. Not included in this manuscript is HDX data for other spike constructs from two other labs that also show this same behavior. We would also like to point out, as we did in our manuscript, that bimodal or multimodal distributions can detect multiple conformations and have been used to great effect in other studies of viral proteins (we think Benhaim et al. Science Advances 2020 is a particularly good example). Additionally, the structural transition we report in this manuscript is consistent with Cryo-EM data of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (Edwards et al. NSMB 2021), and of structural transitions of other viral spike proteins that have been previously studied (Gilman et al. Nature Communications 2019). We are aware of three publications that include HDX data of the spike ectodomain, Raghuvamsi et al. eLife 2020, Zuzic et al. biorXiv 2021, and Huang and Nguyen et al bioRxiv 2021. We have already included a supplementary note to address the fact that Raghuvamsi et al., and Huang and Nguyen et al. did not observe the heterogeneity we report. While we have not had conversations with the Anand lab, we have discussed our results with the D’Arcy lab. In reviewing their data - they do note wider than expected isotopic distributions that are consistent with the heterogeneity we report, although in their case it does not result in two separately quantifiable distributions, likely due to the multiple reasons we discuss in our supplemental note. Zuzic et al. do report a bimodal distribution for a single peptide, in a region where we too observe bimodal behavior, and conclude this is consistent with heterogeneity, but do not state whether this is observed in other regions, or why it was not observed or noted in Raghuvamsi et al, despite appearing to share the same data set. To summarize what we have said here and what we say in our supplemental note, we believe that all released spike HDX data sets are consistent with our findings. Lastly, we agree that it is important to include raw isotopic distributions across relevant timescales, which is why we include them in our supplemental information (supplemental figure 3A/B). We also include observed isotopic distributions many other times in our manuscript to support our conclusions (figure 2A/B, figure 3D, figure 4A, and supplemental figure 3C). For ease of plotting and for clarity, these are extracted distributions (normalized intensity for each isotopic state for an individual peptide).

This complicates the sequence analysis (you have to fix this overlap before adjusting the contig start position) and often necessitates additional manual intervention if using Canu assemblies as input to Trycycler. More generally, Flye is my overall favourite assembler for bacterial genomes for a number of reasons. In particular, its assemblies have fewer 'glitchy' regions than other assemblers. In the benchmarking study, this is demonstrated by Flye's low 'max indel' values. In the Trycycler preprint, we measure this with 'worst-100-bp identity'. Since I think Flye is the best single assembler for bacterial genomes, I wanted it to be the main point of comparison with Trycycler. Put another way, based on the results in the benchmarking study, I expect Canu would perform considerably worse than Flye in the Trycycler paper analysis. And regarding the links in the paper, one is to a Trycycler paper GitHub repo ( https://github.com/rrwick/T... which has most of the data and scripts, and the other link is to a bridges site ( https://bridges.monash.edu/... which contains datasets too large for the GitHub repo.

Most terms are mixed without understanding of their meaning: uncertainty, error, model, map, accuracy, validation. There is a complete mental confusion in this article, and many of the proposed solution arise because of ignorance of the underlying problems and basic misunderstanding of statistical analysis. Aggregation at the pixel level. Do the authors realize that this is again nonsense? Spatial prediction is made at point, pixels are just visualization. Aggregating (I guess the authors mean averaging) means that the short-scale variation is removed. This is simply wrong and the same as manual modification of the data. This is explained in any spatial statistics book, see the book of Cressie (1991). For accuracy statistics, see Janssen et al (1995). The paper of Janssen explain what are accuracy statistics, and how to use them. This is basic literature, but still… Janssen, P. H. M., & Heuberger, P. S. C. (1995). Calibration of process-oriented models. Ecological Modelling, 83(1-2), 55-66. “spatial insight into the model inaccuracies” is not provided by bootstrapping. This is explained in any book on ecological modelling. Do the authors work in a bubble? And 100 bootstrap is too little to obtain a reliable confidence interval. There are other solutions in the literature, such as quantile regression. But for this the authors should read the literature. At some point the authors attempt to detect extrapolation, I must say this is poorly made and again there are a lot of confusion of what extrapolation is. I would simply argue that the sampling data should have sufficient coverage to not have to worry about this problem, and if extrapolation occurs the prediction intervals will show it. Also, extrapolation is not simply related min-max of predictor variables. The authors want to detect extrapolation but then use spatial cross-validation to force extrapolation, that is, validation of the model at unseen places in both geographic and predictor space to correct for spatial correlation. Again, the serious literature never recommended this, can you please read the book of Cressie on spatial statistics and validation of spatial models? I am sorry to say that also the discussion and recommendation is poor. What about validation of models? Overall in the paper the authors are confused about uncertainty and error, and between the different sources of uncertainty.

The emphasis, understandably, is on the mechanistic basis of the fitness-benefit arising from the duplication of the ancestral gene that gave rise to the two ERN paralogues: the broadly expressed ERN1 and mucous producing secretory epithelium-selective ERN2 of vertebrates. The finding that epithelial-selective depletion of mouse Xbp1, phenocopies the consequences of germline deletion of Ern2 is taken as evidence that Ern2 exerts at least some of its effects in goblet cells, via XBP1 - an effector common to the products of both ERN genes (IRE1a and IRE1b). This conclusion is plausible, but the data presented in figure 1A and 3A also suggests that the consequences of XBP1 depletion in terms of Alcian Blue positive cell number are 2X more severe than those of Ern2 deletion (~0.17 cells per crypt in wildtype, versus ~0.12 in the Ern2∆ and ~0.06 in the XBP1∆). This may arise from XBP1 having a broad role in tissue development, with secondary consequences on goblet cells, but may also arise from a contribution of IRE1a (the product of the Ern1 gene) to XBP1 splicing in goblet cells - in other words reflecting functional redundancy between the two ERN isoforms in mucous producing cells. The latter possibility seems at odds with the emphasis in the abstracts on non-redundancy of the two isoforms, which suggests important qualitative differences between the two, whereas the two genes may in fact be pullin.g in the same direction, in so far as their effector functions are concerned.",2021-07-30T10:11:56,disqus_JNVBDeaHLu,David Ron,10.1101/2021.07.28.453864,The epithelial-specific ER stress sensor IRE1β enables host-microbiota crosstalk to affect colon goblet cell development,"Michael J.

Some mechanisms for microtubule polarity sorting in axons had been previously proposed but were recognised as being insufficient to fully explain the observations. Very nice original science with important implications for nervous system development, axon regeneration and neurodegenerative disease. Summary of findings Unlike dendrites, axons have microtubules that are almost all oriented with their growing (+) ends outwards. The mechanistic basis of this is not completely understood. Axonal microtubules are in a constant state of dynamic equilibrium, with their + ends growing but being subject to periodic ‘catastrophe’ that shortens them, either by dying back from their previously growing + ends or by severing them to create two 'daughter' microtubules, each with the potential for new growth. Unlike in other cell types, axonal microtubules are not attached to the centrosome but form a tiling array along the axon composed of individual microtubules from a few microns to over 100 microns in length (see work of Peter Baas and colleagues). Some kind of relationship between this dynamic equilibrium and selection of polarity appears likely but it has been unclear what that might be. To understand the mechanism, Jakobs et al used live imaging of microtubules in Drosophila axons in culture, labelled with EB1-GFP, which marks the growing tip. They find that during early axon growth in culture, microtubules with their + ends oriented distally have a growth advantage over those in the opposite orientation, so that over time + end-out becomes the dominant orientation. First, they show that each microtubule growth events is (on average) longer if the microtubule is further distal in a growing axon and if the microtubule is oriented + end out. The difference between + end out, and in, microtubules is more marked distally. Then, they measure the shrinkage distances in these same orientations and locations using double labelling of EB1 and tubulin. They use a mathematical model to show that + end-out oriented microtubules near growing tips have essentially unbounded growth (since the average growth event is longer in distance than the average shrinkage event), while in other locations and orientations average microtubule length stabilises because of the larger contribution of shrinkage events. Using two methods to disrupt microtubule polymerisation (nocodazole and increased osmolarity) they then confirmed the importance of this +/- growth difference in establishing unipolarity. They also hypothesised that microtubule growth promoting proteins locally synthesised at the axon tip, such as p150, would explain the longer growth cycles of +end out oriented microtubules there, and supported this hypothesis with p150 knockdown and dominant negative mutants. Again, removing the growth length differential also removed the orientation difference. Finally, they address the orientation imbalance in more proximal axon regions that is less easy to explain based on a p150 gradient. They propose a model in which dynein-mediated sliding of – end out orientated microtubules towards the cell body, and templating of new microtubules, essentially matching existing orientation bias, could explain these differences. No additional data are presented for this part but it clearly forms a new hypothesis for further testing. Implications Axonal transport deficits are an important driver of axon loss and neurological deficits. For example, mutations in the anterograde motor protein KIF5A are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, Charcot-Marie Tooth disease and ALS, all disorders of long axon degeneration in which distal regions are affected first. Toxic blockade of axonal transport, for example in vincristine neuropathy, is also an important cause of axon damage. This article sheds light on the basic mechanisms that establish, and presumably also maintain effective, directional axonal transport. Severe defects in this process of selection would be expected to result in failure of neuronal differentiation or axon growth. The likely phenotypic outcome of a severe defect would be embryonic lethality but partial defects could also occur and could therefore underlie disorders of axonal transport even if axons do initially form and carry out the process. Indeed, p150 mutations are associated with ALS. It would be really interesting to know how such mutations affect microtubule polarity and whether this underlies pathogenesis in these cases of ALS, or indeed in any other neurodegenerative disorders. It is challenging to address this in vivo, even in animal models, because of the requirement for live imaging of microtubule growth so I am not aware of any previous studies, but it is in principle an achievable aim now this mechanism has been identified. Limitations At present these findings are limited to Drosophila axons (seemingly dispersed starting from the entire CNS?) so it remains to be confirmed whether there are similar patterns in mammalian axons, and in different neuronal subtypes (e.g., CNS/PNS, motor/sensory, etc). Minor suggestions for improvement Just a presentational thing but in Fig 1E legend, would it be clearer to say ‘blue, right to left downwards’ than ‘blue, left to right upwards’ since these microtubule are in fact growing from right to left? Or probably the colour-coding explained in part D is already sufficient without this extra explanation? A bit more introduction to what is templating and sliding would be helpful. It would be just marginally easier to follow without the switch in axon orientation between Figs 1-3 and Fig 4. But this is a minor point that perhaps just keeps our reversal learning sharp anyway! Questions for the authors Superficially, it could be imagined that the more stable an axonal microtubule the better, since they are so crucial for axonal transport. Yet, this is clearly not the case, otherwise the state of dynamic equilibrium would not have evolved. Does this new model for selection of orientation shed any light on what that advantage of the dynamic equilibrium is? Studies of shrinkage events are so far limited to shrinkage from the distal end. Is there any contribution also from severing and how could that be measured? If +end-out microtubules at the distal end have unbounded growth what eventually stops them? Something must do this in the end because otherwise a mature axon would be clogged with lots of microtubules extending right up to the distal tip. Is this one of the functions of severing? In Fig 3b and c, there seems to be not only a decrease in + end-out growth distances but an increase in the growth of – end out microtubules. The same is true in Fig 3j and k when p150 is disrupted. Are these consistent observations and what could explain them? It would seem more likely that these interventions would disrupt microtubule growth regardless of orientation? To what extent do you think similar mechanisms may operate in mature axons, or is this phenomenon limited to axon growth stages? At the very least it seems likely that they also recur during axon regeneratio but in this context it would be very interesting to know if there are CNS/PNS differences in vertebrates given the difference in axon regeneration.",2021-07-29T10:14:35,disqus_VYxqCWKMak,Michael Coleman,10.1101/2021.06.03.446862,Unrestrained growth of correctly oriented microtubules instructs axonal microtubule orientation,"Maximilian AH Jakobs, Assaf Zemel, Kristian Franze",2021-06-03
