https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.17.524485v1#comment-6114030585,biorxivstage,1,"The following is the response of Prof. Meng-Qiu Dong and Dr. Yong Cao: Hello Juri, Thanks so much for your professional advice and good questions. Yong Cao and I had several rounds of discussion on the issues you raised. Your suggestions and comments are italicized. We will follow up as more results come out. We discussed your manuscript in our lab and enjoyed its balanced tone and inquisition of an important aspect of the search. Thank you for sharing your search parameters for xiSEARCH and as a developer of that tool I second your choice of parameters completely. However, to answer the question “STY or not STY?” your current search experiment seems insufficient to us for reasons detailed below, and we would like to suggest a number of controls and changes. When allowing either KSTY or KGVL you disregard an important element of link assignment based on the often-incomplete MS data. Indeed, the MS2 data often do not unambiguously assign the linked residue by neighbouring backbone fragments and the likely link site is chosen based on the predefined chemistry of the linker. Fig 2G is a nice example of this. Depending on what you define as chemical preference of the crosslinker, you either report S or G. In all those cases, any residue is equally likely based on the MS data and your linker definition determines the reported site. If STY are disregarded and the abundant GVL are pre-defined, obviously, they will be reported. To put this to an extreme, why do you not disregard K as a link possibility and only allow GVL? We would like to suggest a couple of changes to your experiment: (1) To determine if STY are targets of NHS crosslinkers, only evaluate sites that were reported unambiguously based on MS data, i.e, with neighbouring fragments. Maybe run a completely indiscriminate crosslinker and look for enriched amino acids. Open modification search analyses linear peptides which differ from crosslinked peptides in not having a second reaction step in a spatially confined setting. The first reaction of a crosslinker brings it into the protein, the second reaction takes place with a spatially proximal residue of appropriate chemistry. The second step can only be assessed by looking into crosslinked peptides. Reply #1: These are good points.  Evaluating only the sites that are reported unambiguously based on MS data is an excellent idea, but doing it requires a software tool to filter out such CSMs. Unfortunately, we do not have such a tool. Do you know if anyone has such a tool? About running a completely indiscriminate crosslinker, we are wondering what will go into this. Do you suggest that we search, for example, a DSS dataset as if DSS could react with any amino acid and see what happens? Or, to do a new wet-lab experiment with a completely indiscriminate cross-linker? What cross-linker would it be? Not sure if photoactivated cross-linkers are truly completely indiscriminate. It’s unclear to us what question this experiment aims to address. (2) To determine if the data support STY as well or as poorly as the chemically meaningless GVL, define a linker KSTYGVL to let STY and GVL compete. Note that xiSEARCH currently will take the more C-terminal residue in any ambiguity window and thus have some random component in link site assignment. If an ambiguity window contains a K near STY, xiSEARCH has a preference setting for K, though. Consequently, if a STY is reported in favour of a nearby K, there must be supporting MS2 evidence in the spectrum for this report. Reply #2: Thanks for this suggestion. We conducted the KSTYGVL experiment on Ribo-DSSO dataset. As shown below ( Fig. Reply #2), the pLink search result and the xiSearch search result are very similar to each other. Once again, the identified GVL-cross-links outnumbered those of STY-cross-links, agreeing with the results obtained from separate KSTY and KGVL searches. (3) Do the GVL linker experiment (no KSTY). I would expect you to find many crosslinked peptides, nearly all the same peptide pairs as with K or KSTY. Reply #3: We conducted the GVL-only search and the STY-only search and compared the identification results with K-only (K and protein N-term) search at the sequence pair level. Namely, if two pairs of cross-linked peptides—one from the GVL- or STY-only search and the other from the K-only search—involve the same pair of peptides irrespective of the link sites, they are regarded as a match (peptide sequence IDs are consistent). This analysis showed that 56-60% of the GVL- or STY-only search results overlapped with the K-only search (see Vienn diagrams below, Fig. Reply #3). However, 39.5% of cross-links IDed from the GVL-only search are unique, suggesting that they contain false peptide sequence IDs. Similarly, 44.1% of cross-links IDed from the STY-only search are unique. As the two percentages—39.5% and 44.1%—are close, we conclude that if some of the STY cross-links are correct, they should be few. This agrees with the results of all the other analyses conducted in this study. (4) Do KYST versus KGVL and match the YST with the GVL peptides where the are the identical peptide matches and compare the score. Plot a 2D scatter plot with score(YST) versus score(GVL). My expectation is that you will have many equal scoring peptides (ambiguity window based on insufficient MS2 data) and many cases where the score(YST) will be larger. Reply #4: Good advice—thank you! We made two scatter plots, one for the pLink search result and one for xiSearch (shown below, Fig. Reply #4). For most pairs, we see nearly identical scores. Occasionally, a STY-cross-link may score better or worse than its cognate GVL-cross-link. In Supplementary Figure 4C, we present a well-matched spectrum for a K-V cross-link. In this spectrum, one can find evidence from fragment ions for α16(V) being the link site instead of the adjacent α15(K). To us, this example shows that accidental match does happen, for GVL-cross-links as well as for STY-cross-links. As a final note, link site assignment is currently an open issue of crosslinking, and you are right to point this out. Curiously, speaking to Jan Kosinski as a modeller, he did not care about link sites at all. Our own work on using photo-crosslinking (where link site assignment is even more problematic because of the wider reactivity) did not show difference in protein structure model quality using link sites with a +/- 5 residue scatter (PMID: 26385339). So far, it seems to be unclear if link site precision offers any structural value. I hope it does… albeit it might not, considering the length of NHS crosslinkers and the flexibility of proteins. From a mass spectrometry side I would, nonetheless, prefer to see link sites reported with a measure of precision. Reply #5: We agree with you on this for the most part. The third paragraph of the discussion section of our manuscript conveys a message that echoes much of what you have said above. Namely, Category I and Category II STY-cross-links, which are actually K-K cross-links and K-mono-links that are misidentified as K-STY cross-links or in rare cases as STY-STY cross-links, are of little harm. However, some Category III STY-cross-links could be misleading in serious ways, because they involve falsely identified peptides. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us, and for inviting us to think more. We have enjoyed this discussion and we look forward to exchanging more ideas with you.

I learned a lot from it, and really enjoyed your research. Overall, I thought your focus was fascinating and your flow of ideas from one question the next was clear and significant. Here are a few more specific constructive comments I had (and comments from my classmates), and I'll try not to repeat my classmate! These comments are only to help, so I hope they do; sorry if my comments are just due to myself misunderstanding the data, but hopefully they can call for clarity. 1) For the flow cytometry data in Fig 1A, we discussed possibly having a positive control to give us a visual of how your results show the resulted significance. How about a foxp3-coded bead for the positive control? 2) For Fig 1, like my classmate said, the experimental methods were unclear why you chose the male sex for the mice, especially when you used female mice to donate WT Tregs later in Fig 3 to both sexes? Explaining your reasoning for these choices, and controlling for sex could be more clear. 3) For Fig 1B and 1D, it might be helpful to include transformed data as well as the untransformed data to see the statistically transformed significance. 4) For immunofluorescence imaging in Fig. 2, 4, and 5 like mentioned the stain colors (dark blue and light blue together) is confusing, and the grey stain is basically impossible to see. 5) Furthermore, though you specified sample size, it is unclear if they are samples from the same mice or different mice... if it was the former, then it would actually  be n=1. Just being specific about this would clear up this uncertainty. 6) For figure 3, you put adoptively transferred Tregs into both male and female mice which gives an extra category of sex to your data, along with the category of aged v. young Tregs. You need to account for this category in your data to ensure reliability in your resulting significance. A 2-way ANOVA might be more appropriate over a 1-way ANOVA. 7) Showing significance bars/stars on Fig 3D and 3H would be consistent and helpful. 8) Would be helpful to include the FDR in subfig 4 9). The volcano plot in 4B is extremely pixilated and the reader cannot zoom in to a clear figure to analyze. 10) The sample sizes are variable, and for some of the small sample sizes, it is unclear if there is a large enough effect size for these to be meaningful. Maybe running a power analysis could clarify this. Thank you for reading, and hopefully these comments can help. Overall, this paper was really interesting and definitely brought light to Tregs role in remyelination and potential targets for demyelinating diseases and decreasing functionality with age.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.19.521067v1#comment-6113150292,biorxivstage,2,"Review of the paper by Rahmberg et al. “Ongoing Production of Tissue-Resident Macrophages from Hematopoietic Stem Cells in Healthy Adult Macaques” [part of the MICR603 “Journal club in Immunology”] Summary. Tissue-resident macrophage are cells playing an important role in homeostasis of tissues by removing dying cells as well as responding to local exposures to microbes. The origin of tissue-resident macrophages has been under intense investigation; studies primarily done in laboratory mice suggest that some macrophages (e.g., microglia) are derived from yolk sac during embryonic development while other macrophages (e.g., in the gut) are primarily derived from circulating in the blood monocytes. Laboratory mice are typically kept in clean conditions with little to no exposure to many pathogens, and whether the conclusions found studies with mice extend to other animals including humans remains unclear. This study takes an advantage of using GFP-expressing hematopoietic stem cell (HPSC) transplantation of monkeys with barcoded stem cells to track the dynamics of barcoded, bone marrow-derived cells in the tissues. Interestingly, the authors found that macrophages in liver, spleen/LN, and GI tract have high frequency of the GFP expressing cells and suggesting high turnover of these tissue-resident macrophages from bone marrow-derived precursors. Authors performed several additional analyses to ensure robustness of their findings including imaging of GFP-expressing macrophages, analysis of barcode sequences between different bone marrow-derived T cells, and using classical pulse-chase experiments to detect division of macrophages in the tissues. Positive feedback. The study is a timely addition to the debate on the origins of tissue-resident macrophages in animals that live in environments with larger exposure to environmental antigens. The use of barcoded bone marrow-derived cells to track origin of cells in the peripheral tissues is innovative and interesting. The analysis of imaging data to ensure that GFP-expressing macrophages are not phagocytosing other cells is important, and PCA analysis of the barcodes is important to establish relatedness between different cell types. Labeling with BrdU is also a useful way to look at cell turnover that had been forgotten and may be revived by this study. Yet, because of some missing controls and not fully rigorous analysis of the data the conclusion that tissue-resident macrophages in monkeys undergo relatively rapid replacement from bone marrow-derived cells remains to be determined. Major Concerns It seems that several controls are missing in the paper. In particular, having the data in which samples are done very early after HPSC transplantation would be very important - it is expected that no GFP+ cells would be then found in tissues - so, presenting data for GFP+ cells (e.g., for key populations) as these change over time would be most useful for interpretation (some of that is present with barcodes but comes too late in the paper). This is a major limitation of the study that does not allow to fully interpret the data. Most tissues are filled with blood. How do you know that you did not sample cells in the blood that have features of macrophages (e.g., MHCII+)? Work with serial intravascular staining by Mario Roederer’s group clearly showed contamination of tissue samples (e.g., LNs) by blood-derived cells (PMID: 33441422). Some type of control is needed (e.g., intravascular staining). Are these “myeloid cells” macrophages? Can the authors show some other types of data, e.g., imaging that clearly identifies those isolated cells as macrophages? Gut-resident macrophages are known to be primarily monocyte-derived, so for these cells, finding high frequency of GFP+ cells is not surprising. What about brain-associated macrophages in monkeys? Are these HPSC-derived? (In mice, they seem to be yolk sac-derived). Another site to look at may be skin and other skin cells (e.g., Langerhans cells?) It is hard to interpret what the data on percent of GFP+ cells mean. For example, if one finds 20% of cells with irradiation of monkeys in 2-3 months after transplantation, what does this suggest in terms of kinetics of macrophage turnover? It seems that the authors would benefit from some type of mathematical modeling-based analysis to generate a baseline prediction on expectations. PCA analysis lacks rigor. Finding that some points are “clustered” and some are not must be done with some statistical tests. For example, resampling the data and reclustering may provide some evidence of robustness of clusters. Interpretation of BrdU data can be made better.  There have been a wealth of mathematical models aim at inferring cell division and death rates from pulse chase experiments (e.g., 9469816, 10799860, 12737664, 23034350), perhaps authors could use those methods to provide some boundaries of the macrophage division rate and/or differentiation-from-monocyte rates. Also, including some data - if available - on labeling during pulse dynamics - could be very informative. A comparison to some other cells that we know do not have long residency time in tissues may be useful - e.g., neutrophils. THese are thought to be relatively short-lived cells in the blood (but this is again debated) and in the tissues. What is the GFP/barcode kinetics in neutrophils? Minor concerns Authors should better describe experimental design and specifically sampling details. For example, Fig 1A does not fully explain when the animals were sampled. Is 46m is the time of 1st sample for JM82? Is 49m when the animal was sacrificed? Only looking at Fig 3 it is possible to see sampling times but this is too late in the paper. Captions must be improved to explain that all and be more detailed. There are sometimes too generic statements that may not be fully supported by the presented data, e.g., turnover of ALL macrophages being rapid (e.g., last paragraph in Discussion). Yet, authors only sampled some tissues. Paper organization could be improved. For example, it is easier to review the paper when figures and figure captions are located on the same page. Numbering the lines in the paper can help to provide comments to specific parts of the paper. Better formatting of the references would be helpful - .e.g, more space between individual entries or numbering the entries. Figure 2D could include control with macrophages that may carry high levels of of TCRg, e.g., from the thymus. Figure 2 figure legend could be more descriptive about which panels are representative of which sample Figure 2 could have info on the tissues where samples were coming from (e.g., Macrophage/liver), etc. GFP staining in these images is hard to interpret - perhaps adding a membrane stain and DAPI (nuclear stain) could help to tell that GFP is in the cytoplasm. Table 1 could also include symbols/shapes used in graphs to identify animals. Would be very interesting to see spleen confocal to compare macrophages and their GFP staining - will them have the scattered signal due to taking up dying cells? Adding shapes used in Figure 1A &D to differentiate each group to Table 1 would be helpful It may be useful to discuss potential reasons for macrophage dynamics differences between mice and monkeys - is that because species are different or because they live in different environments. Would experiments in dirty mice be useful to tell if the environment is what is the main driver of (perhaps) different macrophage dynamics in some tissues? For necropsied animals, is it possible to show data for macrophages in tissues that show little evidence of link to hematopoietic system (e.g., microglia)? It may be useful to more thoroughly discuss the efficiency of lentivirus infection. Does this efficiency impact interpretation of GFP/barcode dynamics, e.g., does one need to normalize the data in some way? The number of samples per time point (e.g., Fig 5) is varied per animal and tissue. Perhaps some justification of this could be useful. In Figure 3, would it be possible to better describe how to interpret the PCA plots? Also, it would be good to use other colors besides green and red as green-red color blindness is the most common form.",2023-02-11T22:49:23,vitalyvganusov,Vitaly V.

It is particularly interesting to see a low-risk experimental framework to quickly evaluate some of the risks posed by possible future recombination when diverse variants are co-circulating. I am curious about the rationale to define ""Delta"" as 90% GISAID consensus for B.1.617.2 and define ""Omicron"" as 90% consensus for BA.1. Omicron by this definition is a genome that has been observed, but it is unclear that Delta as defined in Fig 3A has been observed, with a previous report defining 5 Delta clades [1] that each include multiple non-synonymous ORF1a mutations. Are we sure that Delta as defined here was ""naturally occuring"" and that, if it was, how relevant is this genome to those previously compared to Omicron? Specifically with respect to nsp6, Delta sequences include one of H11Q, T77A,  or V149A (the latter with or without T181I). Notably, nsp6 T77A is defining for B.1.617.1. Searching COV-SPECTRUM for March-May 2021, 39,726 sequences include Delta consensus mutations in Fig 3a. There are 21 sequences within that set with nsp6 lacking any of these mutations and brief examination of placements on the UShER tree indicate imperfect sequences (reversions, etc). Additionally, Omicron BA.2/3/4/5 have nsp6 differing from that in BA.1, but the same as that observed in previous variants (e.g. alpha, beta, and gamma). It would be very interesting to see apples-to-apples comparisons of these nsp6 and hopefully this methodology can help unravel the significance of recurrent nsp6 deletions and subsequent nsp6 adaptation in future work. While Delta lineages were eventually dominated by those containing nsp6 T77A (~97% by the end of 2021), a Delta lineage with nsp6 V149A/T181I contributed its nsp6 to the XBC lineage, with derivative lineages adding nsp6 I50T. This is one of the few ""Deltacron"" lineages with a Delta nsp6 and may be of special interest. Lastly, Fig 3A does not include S:G142D in its definition of Delta; absence in over 10% of sequences is a dropout artifact [2]. [1] Stern et al. medRxiv 2021. https://www.medrxiv.org/con...

We selected your paper to read as part of our Journal Club seminar for the Biomedical Research Minor at UCLA. First of all, thank you so much for sharing your research; this was a fantastic paper and I learned a lot from it. I wanted to share some of the feedback we discussed during the seminar in the hope that some of it may be useful! 1) We were curious how you chose the sex of the mice to be used in each experiment, as it doesn't seem to be consistent throughout. Also, what were your inclusion/exclusion criteria for the young and aged mice cohorts? 2) Fig. 1: Very minor, but in Fig. 1I the image itself has 14dpl in the title but 10dpl in the figure legend. 3) Fig. 2: The pseudocoloring is really difficult to see, especially with DAPI as blue, OLIG2 as cyan, and CNP as grey. It could potentially be easier to see if OLIG2 and CNP could be changed to yellow and green. Also, for Fig. 2G, it would be helpful to clarify whether the cerebellar slices included in the sample size of n=7 are from the same mice or from different mice. 4) Fig. 3: We were curious if you had also considered doing the reverse experiment (young Treg injected into aged Treg-depleted mice). 5) Fig. 4-5 (and throughout the paper): We were wondering if you had done power analyses for this study given the highly variable sampling throughout the paper. For instance, it seemed like there were over 10 mice used in some experiments and as few as 3 in others, so we were curious about the reasoning behind these decisions. Overall, though, this paper was really informative and exciting to read!

The authors present a lot of data and the results about temperature-dependent PapR maturation reveal new information about the mechanisms underlying quorum-sensing in these bacteria. However, in my opinion, the conclusions regarding expression heterogeneity are based on data that present a major flaw. Plasmid pHT315 is not appropriate for the measurement of fluorescence intensity because it induces heterogeneity in itself, probably because of its copy number. The authors should have verified this by using a control such as the promoter of a constitutively-expressed gene. They would have seen the same kind of result as they see with PlcR-regulated genes. Plasmid pHT304 should have been used instead. The reference for plasmid pHT315 is wrong. It should be Arantes and Lereclus Gene. 108 (1991)115-l 19. The difference in cell morphology between strains that only differed by the reporter fusion they carry is also puzzling (chains or filaments, it's difficult to say, versus individualized cells ; Figure 2).

This hypothesis is purely based on the fitting of atomic models in the extra densities. No experimental evidence to support this hypothesis is provided. The idea that RNA assembles together with amyloids has been proposed; the new contribution here is the fitting of atomic models. But, because of disorder and a possible mismatch with the imposed helical symmetry, the quality of the extra densities is generally poor. Therefore, the potential fit of atomic models of molecules in these densities is not enough evidence to conclude that such molecules are responsible for these densities. More experimental data will be needed to find out what molecules are responsible for these extra densities, which would have potentially important implications for our understanding of these diseases.",2023-02-07T09:28:11,sjors_scheres,Sjors Scheres,10.1101/2023.02.01.526613,RNA as a component of fibrils from Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerations,Leslie R.

James is posting it on behalf of the author (who wishes to remain anonymous) to provide additional background context on the issue of how Orf3a could be misidentified as an ion channel. This paper is welcome because the biophysical aspects of previous viroporin work are problematic. The virology and other aspects of those works are presumably technically correct. But this speaks to the problems of silos, and that at some point virology and biophysics really need to sit down and have a talk. Below, I highlight how the papers from the virology labs are weak in the biophysical aspects. Consequently, the field is replete with exceedingly poorly executed and reviewed biophysics work that has proven to be irreproducible. A nice review  ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... by Colin Nichols and Conor McClenaghan outlines the problems with the interpretations in previous work using bilayers, oocytes or mammalian cells. This paper by Miller/Clapham sets the record straight with regard to SARS CoV 2 protein 3a. It builds on Steve Grant in Henry Lester's lab at Caltech work ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih..., which has shown that there is no evidence for 3a forming functional channels in oocyte plasma membranes. The Grant/Lester paper did a nice control using Spike and nsp2, which have never been claimed to have ion channel activity. These papers are necessary because of previous, poor-quality papers, which claimed channel activity. For example, Toft-Bertelsen et al. ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go... suggested that 3a was an ion channel.  This paper claimed that numerous other viral accessory proteins - 7 or 8 of them also acted as ion channels, which prompted some skepticism in the field. That paper lacked important controls (e.g. no controls for proteins known not to be an ion channel, like Spike as done in the Grant/Lester paper). The major issue is that it was not properly controlled for the issue of endogenous background channels, sadly ( which is should be pointed out by reviewers as electrophysiology 101). Importantly, the Toft-Bertelsen work didn't even demonstrate that the proteins were in the plasma membrane. Without engineering the expression construct, it is almost certainly all in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, ERGIC). Sixteen biophysicists recently commented in Communications Biology ( https://www.nature.com/arti... on the shortcomings of the Todt-Bertelsen paper, explained several possible sources of artifact, and outlined experimental steps that could be followed to claim ion channel function. There are also papers on the E and 3a proteins that use only bilayer recordings. Two papers on SARS-CoV-1 from the Enjaunes lab show channel records that are scaled multiples of one another. In other words, the E channel (Figure 3a of Verdia-Baguena https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...) and the 3a channels (Figure 3 of Castaño-Rodriguez https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...) appear to be exact scaled copies of the same trace. This example has no rational explanation, but it is illustrative of the problems in the field. It doesn't reflect well on the reviewers and editors of those papers. An example of the steps for Ion channel function being met is observed for the E protein, which is likely to be a channel similar to the M2 of influenza ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go.... Problematic aspects of other previous studies contrasting E and 3a are also reviewed here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go.... The structure of Orf3a is described by Kern et al ( https://www.nature.com/arti.... Key evidence for the channel function is provided by its sensitivity to ruthenium red, which blocks quite a few ubiquitous channels including those found in intracellular organelles. This results provide the main reason for skepticism of an Orf3a-specific result for this due to the high protein ratios. It is possible this is real, but it is unproven. One should keep in mind that ions can get across membranes in multiple ways, so this doesn't have to be by conduction? The current Miller et al manuscript ( https://www.biorxiv.org/con... ) argues strongly against Orf3a channel function and provides an explanation for the results in Kern et al. Miller et al, only saw channels in proteoliposome patch-clamp recordings under the highest protein conditions used. These channel recordings were sensitive to DIDS and therefore likely to be due to contamination by VDAC or something similar.",2023-02-06T22:17:47,fraserlab,Fraser Lab,10.1101/2022.09.02.506428,"The SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf3a is not an ion channel, but does interact with trafficking proteins","Alexandria N.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.02.514751v1#comment-6109000141,biorxivstage,2,"Cryo-crystallography is one of the most common techniques used in x-ray data collection of macromolecules. This is because cryogenically freezing crystals helps minimize radiation damage and extend crystal lifetime which allows for complete data sets collected from single crystals. However, proteins are not rigid and exist as a conformational ensemble. This is relevant for studying protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions because some binding/interaction sites may require alternative side-chain conformations or subtle backbone changes that may be inaccessible under cryogenic conditions due to shifting the energy landscape. In this paper, the authors sought to address the protein-ligand interactions at room temperature (RT) by performing a large crystallographic fragment screen. They utilized the therapeutic target PTP1B using 2 RT screens which consist primarily of fragments that have been tested previously at cryogenic temperatures. The main outcome of this paper reveals novel ligand binding poses in allosteric sites which is relevant for understanding allosteric mechanisms, however, at RT relatively fewer weakly-binding fragments are found. Along with this, a new fragment-binding site is also reported in the paper - importantly this site was identified at RT, but not by any fragments at cryo temperature. The last section of the paper also describes the identification of a fragment bound to the Lys197 of the allosteric site. The binding pose of the fragment at this position is similar to a covalent inhibitor to the mutant protein. The major strength of this paper is demonstrating that RT screening has the potential to reveal additional allosteric binding sites that may otherwise be inaccessible at cryogenic temperatures. The major limitation of this paper is the low coverage of chemical space due to focusing on previous fragments that were detected under cryo conditions and could be strengthened with a broader screen of chemical space for fragments that were not previously tested. Further, the lower hit rate compared to cryo screening may limit the utility of RT screening in a structure based drug-design approach. The paper is written concisely with a clear focus on the comparison of fragment binding at RT and cryo temperatures, however lacking few things which we would like to highlight below: Major points: In Figure 5, the authors point out that cryo and RT fragments can bind at the same site but in different poses to suggest relevance in allosteric inhibitor design but don’t fully explore the chemical rationale for alternate binding poses. It would be beneficial if the authors could describe the environment around the alternate binding poses to potentially explain if both conformations are relevant or if one is more likely than the other. In Figure 6A, the authors claim that a previously modeled cryo pose does not correspond well with the RT event map, however we feel that the event map appears to plausibly support both conformations. The only conclusion we can draw from here is the presence of water molecule in cryo and not in RT density. It may be worthwhile to try paired refinement to determine if the absence of the water at RT is due to resolution differences between the two data sets. In Figure 7A, the authors claim that the RT event map supports a flipped pose for fragments compared to cryo, however, the cryo event map is ambiguous and the absence of density (owing to lower resolution for this dataset at cryo?) suggest that the cryo ligand may be modeled incorrectly. Minor: Fig S4-H: Does the RT event map support alternate conformation for the fragment/ too ambiguous? Or is it a case of a new binding pose at the same site? In Figure 8A: 38A in legend or 40A in text? In Figure 9, the authors explain that the isatin-based fragment is covalently linked to Lys197 at RT but not cryo and suggest that the absence of this fragment from cryo may be due to insufficient soaking. It seems reasonable to follow up this “cryo-non-hit” by examining the effect soaking duration has on ligand binding for cryo. The manuscript would also benefit from a chemical schematic showing the covalent mechanism. NOTE - This paper was selected by the lab members for a group discussion. JSF was the postdoctoral advisor of Keedy and graduate advisor for Biel, who are authors on this paper - and is acknowledged in the manuscript for helpful discussions prior to posting the preprint. Thus, there is a conflict of interest that may color others' assessment of the review, which was driven by group members.

The monocyte data (normal vs diseased) are compelling, and they are consistent with other data indicating a problem in innate immune cell function (detection of PAMPs or DAMPS and/or an innate immune cell signaling loop error?). Perhaps it is triggered by exertion products since even ATP or ischemia-reperfusion are known activators of the PRR called NLRP3. I have no ideas about how to understand the messaging to macrophages since they are mostly in tissues.

I have a suggestion if you are going to be modelling more variants in the future. I have developed a PCR based method to identify engineered missense variants and this is faster/cheaper/easier than using restriction digest. Essentially you design a PCR primer that is complementary to the engineered mutations and this will specifically amplify in the mutant. Typically there are 3-6 mutations (missense + silent) in this region so it is specific enough to not amplify wild-type. I detail this approach in Supplemental Figure 1 of this paper https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.046631,2023-02-04T09:14:39,KarenL_PhD,Karen Lange,10.1101/2023.01.07.523106,A humanized Caenorhabditis elegans model of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia-associated variants in kinesin light chain KLC4,"Selin Gümüşderelioğlu, Lauren Resch, Trisha Brock, Undiagnosed Diseases Network, G.W.

Some figures exceeding 80% appear in the literature. As is mentioned in the article, these parasite forms are known as ""hypnozoites"", a term I coined 45 years ago [1]. This hypnozoitophilic dogma is, entirely logically, based on extrapolation from the results of drug treatment of patients with P. vivax malaria. However, the idea does not make sense to me parasitologically. It is not necessarily correct, for reasons explained elsewhere [2,3]. The point is that a proportion of relapse-like P. vivax malarial recurrences might originate from concealed merozoites (a recently confirmed parasite reservoir), as opposed to hypnozoites [3]. The suggestion was originally made 12 years ago [4]. It is not so much a question of why would these merozoites be a source of recrudescent P. vivax malaria but, rather, why would they not be? Luckily, evidence one way or the other should soon be forthcoming from drug-related experimentation using humanized mice [2]. Following on from the novel research concerning inhibition of hypnozoite and hepatic schizont activity that is reported in this bioRxiv paper, perhaps the authors could consider investigating, in addition, what might inhibit non-circulating P. vivax asexual stages (they did include P. falciparum blood stages in their study), such as occur in vast numbers in bone marrow and the spleen. I.e. if feasible. These hidden merozoites may be responsible for numerous clinical malarial episodes and it is possible that they are at least as problematic as hypnozoites. But this remains to be determined. REFERENCES: 1. Markus MB. 2011. The hypnozoite concept, with particular reference to malaria.

We selected your paper to discuss in our undergraduate Journal Club seminar and I wanted to share some of the thoughts and suggestions that came up as we were discussing it. Firstly, thank you for sharing your science and for posting it here! The subject matter of this paper was extremely interesting, and we all enjoyed reading your paper. The background information was presented in a manner that was clear, concise, and detailed; this allowed us (non-experts) to easily engage with your research. Additionally, we came up with some suggestions for your paper: 1)	In Figure 5, we thought it might be nice to present the gene-network and GSEAs in another format. For individuals that are not familiar with these types of analyses, it is rather difficult to infer what’s going on within the figure from just the paper alone. Therefore, an alternative presentation of the data (perhaps in a table or heatmap format) may make it even more accessible. 2)	It seems that the same control was used within Figure 3 and 4 (as the control brain image is the same across both figures); therefore, we suggest that these be combined into one large figure. 3)	Additionally, we noted that single-end RNA sequencing was employed; however, due to the limitations with this technique, in terms of reconstructing transcripts, it may be nice to repeat this experiment with pair-end RNA sequencing. Single-cell RNA sequencing would be even better than pair-end RNA sequencing; however, we acknowledge the immense cost of this technique. 4)	In terms of the RNA experiments, we suggest that the average length of transcripts be noted within the methods section as this would give the reader an indication of the quality of transcripts. 5)	Lastly, we also suggest that the plunger plots within Figure 2 be replaced with a violin plot or a box and whisker plot. We suggest this because within Figure 2b, you can see that there is a lot of variation within the Core group. This variation would be best illustrated with a different plot type and would provide a reader with a visualization of the skew in the data. Overall, we really enjoyed reading this paper and thank you for sharing it here",2023-02-02T20:04:27,francescaday,Francesca Day,10.1101/2023.01.10.523434,Spatial distribution and functional relevance of FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression for glioblastoma tumor invasion,"Nawal Alshahrany, Ana Jimenez-Pascual, Florian A Siebzehnrubl",2023-01-10

I enjoyed reading your paper which intrigued me so much. I have some experience with glioblastoma, so knowing more about them are helpful for me. After reading through the paper, I like how you are bringing ideas on the frontline. From your paper, I learned that FGFR1 and 2 are expressed in both in vitro and in vivo but may have spatial heterogeneity in regions of tumor, also FGFR receptors have antagonist effect on tumor prognosis or potentially on invasion. I also like how the networks presented in the last figure yield some more interesting markers that could be studies further. Here is something I like about this paper: 1.	The paper uses clear languages and explanation that could be easily understand. 2.	I like how you incorporate xenograft model for in vivo study. 3.	I like how you incorporate different types of controls: loading control and positive control ShCo on WB and validation of antibodies / xenograft models. 4.	Additionally, I like how you refer back to in vitro study in your paper, while also mentioning the in vivo results. Here is something I think you could think further / consider for improvements. 1.	For figure 1, even though you test the antibodies and xenograft model, it is interesting that you put failed antibody as your first panel. I don’t usually see this in published papers, I think putting these failed ones in supplementary details are better. 2.	For figure 2, I think the way data is presented could be improved. From my perspective, the data wasn’t normally distributed, thus using mean and standard deviation, as well as plunger plots, are not good graphical choices. Better choices are violin plots and box-and whisker plots, since they show variance and raw data distribution (whether it is skewed). 3.	For study design, you mentioned that you measured percentage of FCFRs in vitro in your previous paper, would you consider also measuring the amount of FCFRs in vivo models? It might be interesting to compare how much percentage of cells express in vivo model, which may provide insights on whether targeting these receptor is good for regulating/inhibiting global tumor invasion. 4.	For figure 3 and 4, I think you also use the same control for both, which may be better to combine into one figure. Otherwise, two sets of control should be used, as the condition may have changed as you run the experiments at different times. I think using ANOVA here would be better. I am also wondering why brain slices shown are incomplete, I think for publication quality, it would be better to put full brain slice in the panel. 5.	For figure 5, I think it is hard to interpret it without some experience with bulk-rnaseq. I hope it could be explained better in the results or method section. Also, putting software generated figures is not a wise choice, because it is not annotated. I think it would be better to make your own plots, or flowchart to show how they work for clarity. My collogue also pointed out the lack of FGFR2 data here, despite it being nonsignificant. 6.	The supplementary figure is extremely blurry, which is hard to read. Overall, thank you for doing the research and sharing it here. Love the passion and hope to see more research on this. I hope my comment somewhat helps to discern some confusion from someone with a bit of cancer experience.",2023-02-02T19:51:11,disqus_3CuY4i52sl,Oliver Xu,10.1101/2023.01.10.523434,Spatial distribution and functional relevance of FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression for glioblastoma tumor invasion,"Nawal Alshahrany, Ana Jimenez-Pascual, Florian A Siebzehnrubl",2023-01-10

This immune function of DCL2 is independent of its canonical function in RNA interference through small RNA. The strength of the study is in the genetic dissection of the autoimmune phenotype caused by DCL2 that was previously described in literature. The authors use phenotypic analysis combined with RNA sequencing in Arabidopsis to show that DCL2 triggers activation of immunity and an autoimmune phenotype through at least two NLR proteins (L5 and RPP9). This is a novel and important discovery. They show that this activity is cytoplasmic and not nuclear. Interestingly, immunity is also activated in tomato by DCL2 and moss by DCL3, suggesting this mechanism is evolutionarily highly conserved. These conclusions are well supported by data and well presented. However, the evidence for an antiviral function of this pathway is not sufficient for the strong claims made in this paper. References to virus are made in the title, the abstract, results and conclusions, and are an important part of the paper, so major concerns need to be addressed. These are listed below, with suggested experiments. -	The virus infection results are not conclusive. For example, in Fig 4A dcl4/l5 line 1 shows more virus accumulation than dcl4/l5 line 2 (which in turn accumulates as much virus as the dcl4 single mutant), while in Fig 4B the opposite is true. In fact, in Fig 4B the l5 mutation is not additive to dcl4 mutation in terms of antiviral defense. In Fig 4B the dcl2 mutant shows significantly less accumulation than WT, which is not the case in Fig 4A and in literature. All this points to high stochastic variability between samples, which can be expected when working with pathogens. It is highly appreciated that the authors show conflicting results between experiments, but these results need to be robust given their importance for the conclusions of the paper. One possible explanation for this variability could be the use of labile in vitro transcripts as inoculum. This could be solved by either randomizing the plants when infecting (not one genotype after the other, if this wasn’t done) and/or use systemically infected tissues from inoculated dcl2/dcl4 mutants as inoculum for rub inoculation (although this TCV clone has no CP, which could be a problem). In any case, the infection experiments need to be repeated with more biological replicates per genotype, in the key genotypes Col, dcl4, l5, rpp9, dcl4/l5, dcl4/rpp9. -	A VSR-impaired virus should not be used to test whether DCL2 has an RNAi-independent function. As this virus is very sensitive to RNAi, in this experimental setup this pathway cannot be uncoupled from the proposed dsRNA-DCL2-NLR sensing pathway. In addition, the P38 VSR is also the viral coat protein, loss of which could impact the viral life cycle and accessibility of dsRNA structures in vivo. On the other hand, the use of wild-type TCV, encoding a very efficient VSR, would reliably show whether DCL2 has a small RNA/AGO-independent antiviral function. In this case WT, dcl4, l5 and rpp9 should show similar levels of virus accumulation, while dcl4/l5 and dcl4/rpp9 should show increased accumulation, if the hypothesis is valid. As above, several replicates should be analyzed. -	A central conclusion in this paper is that DCL2 is a sensor of dsRNA that activates innate immunity through NLRs. While the fact that DCL2 is an RNAseIII strongly suggests that it senses dsRNA, there is limited experimental evidence for this (the knock-out of RNA decay factors in literature and the experiments with TCV-deltaP38 - see comments above). Two experimental approaches would significantly strengthen these conclusions. (1) Treatment with a dsRNA analogue such as poly I:C of the various dcl/NLR mutants described in the paper. Activation of immunity can be assessed by quantifying expression of immune-responsive genes as in Supplementary Figure 1 or as described in literature (DOI: 10.1111/pbi.13327, DOI: 10.1042/EBC20210100). Performing this experiment on WT, dcl2, l5, rpp9, dcl2/l5 and dcl2/rpp9 should genetically determine whether DCL2 activates innate immunity through L5 and RPP9 NLR receptors upon detection of dsRNA. (2) Perform infection experiments with phylogenetically distant RNA viruses, and test activation of immunity as in (1). Available and routinely used in Arabidopsis are, among others, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), Tobacco rattle virus (TRV), Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV), Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and Turnip crinkle virus (TCV – see above). These virus species have very different proteomes, replicate on different organelles, have different capsid shapes, etc. If several of these activate immunity in a DCL2/NLR-dependent fashion, the case for DCL2 being a sensor for dsRNA in vivo would be far more robust. Using these viruses to infect Col, dcl4, l5, rpp9, dcl4/l5, dcl4/rpp9, then assessing viral accumulation, would indicate that in addition to activating immunity, this mechanism also has antiviral activity. If these points are not addressed, I believe that claims of immune activation by viruses and antiviral activity should not be present as major conclusions in the paper. They could be suggested in the discussion. In addition, conclusions regarding dsRNA as the trigger for immunity should be tempered. It is my hope that these experiments will be conducted, and if the current conclusions of the authors are substantiated, this is a very significant discovery and advancement in plant virology and immunity. Next are listed some minor points to address. -	The authors refer to antiviral RNAi function of DCL2 as being dependent on the genetic abrogation of DCL4. The authors state more than once that DCL4 is the main antiviral Dicer, with DCL2 dicing only when DCL4 is somehow overwhelmed by viral dsRNA. This view is not up to date, as more recent studies have shown that in WT plants DCL2 can be an active antiviral RNAi player, depending on virus species and/or tissue (e.g.: doi: 10.1038/nplants.2017.94; doi: 10.1093/nar/gkab802), suggesting that precise function and context of DCL2 in antiviral RNAi remain poorly understood. This should at least be mentioned. -	A whole section in the middle of the manuscript delineates the model proposed by the authors, while describing some of the results. In my opinion this interrupts the flow of the manuscript. The results should be presented as in the rest of the manuscript, while the model should be built in the discussion or at the end of the results. A partial model is also presented in Figure 2, taking away space for data. -	The authors end the final paragraph of the results with “when RNAi has been abrogated by mutation of DCL4”. KO of DCL4 does not abrogate antiviral RNAi, it reduces its efficacy. This should be corrected.",2023-01-31T18:53:04,,Marco Incarbone,10.1101/2023.01.10.523395,Sensing of viral RNA in plants via a DICER-LIKE Ribonuclease,"Carsten Poul Skou Nielsen, Lijuan Han, Laura Arribas-Hernández, Darya Karelina, Morten Petersen, Peter Brodersen",2023-01-11

For instance, the records and molecular data of Botrylloides niger, Symplegma brakenhielmi, and Polyclinum constellatum. Regarding P. constellatum, in fact neither Aydin-Önen et al. (2018) nor Montesanto et al. (2022) addressed this species as a cryptogenic. This species has undoubtedly recently arrived in the Mediterranean, although Virgili et al. (2022) has backdated its arrival and spread since 2014. Being the Mediterranean one of the most studied basin both regarding ascidians taxonomy and introduced species, it is odd that such an invasive species could have originated here and being totally overlooked in the past. Although I agree that relationships with congeneric species in the native areas are unclear and should be revised in the future. I may also add that the low intraspecific divergence of COI gene among different localities it is not a sign of cryptogenicity, and other markers/genes should be used to investigate this issue (see Hudson et al. 2022). I hope these comments may be helpful and I am looking forward to see your work published. R.

As an undergraduate student reading for a journal club course, I found the pre-print well-written with clear language and thorough explanations of background information, making it an excellent introduction to cancer biology and neuroscience research methods for someone with minimal experience in the field, like myself. However, in my opinion, there are several areas in which this publication could be made more easily digestible. In figures 3 and 4, I found some in vivo data presentation choices to be unnecessarily confusing. For instance, in figures 3b and 4b, the coronal slices are in disarray, with large portions of the mouse brain missing, and the use of gray-scale nuclear stain makes it difficult to distinguish hGBM xenografts from the surrounding neural architecture; in the shFGFR1 slice of figure 3b, the xenograft appears indistinguishable from the adjacent lateral ventricle. Moreover, the identical shCo slices presented in both figures 3b and 4b lead the reader to believe that both experimental conditions, shFGFR1 and shFGFR2, were compared against the same shCo group, in which case, the data for all 3 conditions should have been statistically analyzed together and presented in the same figure for clarity. More generally, the use of plunger plots throughout this paper conceals the spread of the data set. An alternative statistical approach, such as box/whisker or violin plots, would have demonstrated the variance in the data. For example, in figure 2b, the mean fluorescence intensity of the tumor core appears to have a more skewed distribution than the invasive edge. Perhaps, this wide range of values reflects the heterogeneity of FGFR1 expression within the tumor core such that there are discrete populations of cells in the core with higher or lower FGFR1 expression. Perhaps, in future experiments, single-cell RNA sequencing with 10X Genomics could be used to identify populations with variable FGFR1 expression within the hGBM xenograft.",2023-01-30T03:30:59,,Nicole Agranonik,10.1101/2023.01.10.523434,Spatial distribution and functional relevance of FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression for glioblastoma tumor invasion,"Nawal Alshahrany, Ana Jimenez-Pascual, Florian A Siebzehnrubl",2023-01-10

Thank you for sharing your search parameters for xiSEARCH and as a developer of that tool I second your choice of parameters completely. However, to answer the question “STY or not STY?” your current search experiment seems insufficient to us for reasons detailed below, and we would like to suggest a number of controls and changes. When allowing either KSTY or KGVL you disregard an important element of link assignment based on the often-incomplete MS data. Indeed, the MS2 data often do not unambiguously assign the linked residue by neighbouring backbone fragments and the likely link site is chosen based on the predefined chemistry of the linker. Fig 2G is a nice example of this. Depending on what you define as chemical preference of the crosslinker, you either report S or G. In all those cases, any residue is equally likely based on the MS data and your linker definition determines the reported site. If STY are disregarded and the abundant GVL are pre-defined, obviously, they will be reported. To put this to an extreme, why do you not disregard K as a link possibility and only allow GVL? We would like to suggest a couple of changes to your experiment: (1) To determine if STY are targets of NHS crosslinkers, only evaluate sites that were reported unambiguously based on MS data, i.e, with neighbouring fragments. Maybe run a completely indiscriminate crosslinker and look for enriched amino acids. Open modification search analyses linear peptides which differ from crosslinked peptides in not having a second reaction step in a spatially confined setting. The first reaction of a crosslinker brings it into the protein, the second reaction takes place with a spatially proximal residue of appropriate chemistry. The second step can only be assessed by looking into crosslinked peptides. (2) To determine if the data support STY as well or as poorly as the chemically meaningless GVL, define a linker KSTYGVL to let STY and GVL compete. Note that xiSEARCH currently will take the more C-terminal residue in any ambiguity window and thus have some random component in link site assignment. If an ambiguity window contains a K near STY, xiSEARCH has a preference setting for K, though. Consequently, if a STY is reported in favour of a nearby K, there must be supporting MS2 evidence in the spectrum for this report. (3) Do the GVL linker experiment (no KSTY). I would expect you to find many crosslinked peptides, nearly all the same peptide pairs as with K or KSTY. (4) Do KYST versus KGVL and match the YST with the GVL peptides where the are the identical peptide matches and compare the score. Plot a 2D scatter plot with score(YST) versus score(GVL). My expectation is that you will have many equal scoring peptides (ambiguity window based on insufficient MS2 data) and many cases where the score(YST) will be larger. As a final note, link site assignment is currently an open issue of crosslinking, and you are right to point this out. Curiously, speaking to Jan Kosinski as a modeller, he did not care about link sites at all. Our own work on using photo-crosslinking (where link site assignment is even more problematic because of the wider reactivity) did not show difference in protein structure model quality using link sites with a +/- 5 residue scatter (PMID: 26385339). So far, it seems to be unclear if link site precision offers any structural value. I hope it does… albeit it might not, considering the length of NHS crosslinkers and the flexibility of proteins. From a mass spectrometry side, I would, nonetheless, prefer to see link sites reported with a measure of precision.",2023-01-26T09:44:19,jurirappsilber,Juri Rappsilber,10.1101/2023.01.17.524485,Comparative analysis of chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry data indicates that protein STY residues rarely react with N-hydroxysuccinimide ester cross-linkers,"Yong Cao, Xin-Tong Liu, Peng-Zhi Mao, Ching Tarn, Meng-Qiu Dong",2023-01-18

However, I am not sure how this ""Perhaps those from another country valued a job in Australia more than one in their country of origin"" can be concluded from ""while those who do not speak English at home appeared to be less pessimistic, they also appeared to be less satisfied with the workplace culture (χ2= 9, df=2, P= 0.011)."" This comment sounds condescendent to me (but maybe that was not the intention). I lived and worked in academia in Australia and my view of that answer is somewhat different. As a non-Australian ERC you could be happy with your job, but not with the workplace culture, especially when you realise that the Australian Science system puts you in a disadvantage just because you are a foreigner (e.g., no access to many funding sources). Add to that, the draconian VISA system and the fact, that even if you are paying taxes, you do not have access to the health care system unless you pay private insurance, and might start understanding the lower satisfaction with the workplace culture for the non-Australian ERC in Australia.",2023-01-24T20:12:49,,Lupin,10.1101/2022.12.06.519378,The Australian academic STEMM workplace post-COVID: a picture of disarray,"Katherine Christian, Jo-ann Larkins, Michael R.

Himes “A robust normalized local filter to estimate occupancy directly from cryo-EM maps.” The version posted January 20, 2023, to biorxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/202.... The problem being investigated: The interpretation and utility of cryo-EM reconstructions [maps hereafter] is often made challenging by spatially localized degradation that may arise from several sources. To this end, many tools exist to estimate and/or modulate cryo-EM maps non-uniformly. These tools are generally sensitive to artifacts in the cryo-EM maps, user-selected processing parameters like the local window size, and image intensity distributions that deviate from those generated by well-isolated globular proteins. The proposed solution: Forsberg, Shah, and Burt propose a non-linear filter based on the maximal value in a sliding window. While existing tools lean toward estimating local resolution or signal-to-noise ratios, the authors aim to avoid problems this may introduce by starting from the premise that the real-space image intensities should be relatively uniform at moderate-to-low resolution unless there is flexibility or compositional heterogeneity. By starting from this simple premise and selecting the max-value filter, the method aims to be robust as well as fast The results: The filter is implemented in Python. The authors have developed a clean and well-designed GUI that is easy to install, intuitive to use, well-documented, and interfaces beautifully with a USCF-Chimerx, a staple visualization tool in the field. The manuscript is well written, and the results clearly show they can measure non-uniformity in real-space cryo-EM maps. Beyond visualization, they demonstrate that this statistic can also be used to modify the cryo-EM map; however, the full utility of such modifications is somewhat less convincing. That is, of course, no concern, as the improved visualization should already be beneficial in cryo-EM map interpretation. Major concerns: None Minor concerns: 1.     Several minor phrasing issues result in statements that could be understood as factually incorrect if read out of context—these I’ve sent to the authors directly. 2.     “So-called ab-initio 3D reconstructions can now be made without user input bias.” It is worth noting that template-based particle picking or even blob-based picking combined with 2d classification can introduce model bias that persists even when ab-initio 3D reconstruction is used. Even the selection of 2D classes can introduce model bias from the users mental model of the target. See for example, Superstitious Perceptions Reveal Properties of Internal Representations, Gosselin and Schyns 2003 Psychological Science. 3.     Resolution in cryo-EM is not a contested term. It is the spatial frequency at which the reconstruction is no longer statistically reliable. The definition of where exactly that point is, however, has been contested in the past. 4.     A few relative qualifiers should be specific—Eg. “reasonably sized input”, “…reasonably set lower…” etc. 5.     In the methods section, the authors point out that the CDF in eq 6 is only valid for statistically independent voxels. While it is often the case that these conditions can be relaxed, I think it is reasonable to ask for an analysis of or justification for using this CDF, given that the core problem the authors address is one that, by definition, results from statistical dependence between pixels. As a simple example, consider a loop flipping back and forth between two positions, resulting in lower average occupancy. At any given time, the intensity measured in one of those positions is correlated with the intensity in the other. 6.     The value of 449’260 CPU seconds in table S1 seems unreasonably high. Are these measurements the average of several repeated experiments? Please double-check. Final thoughts: The authors have presented an algorithm that is robust to common characteristics in cryo-EM maps and developed a tool to execute that algorithm that is easy to use and open to modify. Well done! I could install this and immediately use it in a project I was working on.",2023-01-23T14:56:20,benjamin_himes,Benjamin Himes,10.1101/2023.01.18.524529,A robust normalized local filter to estimate occupancy directly from cryo-EM maps,"Bjoern O.

In the future, I will be using this approach for all of my large knock-in CRISPR experiments. In my hands, CRISPR using a ssDNA repair template for a large insertion (~1Kbp, GFP) was 30% more efficient than the corresponding dsDNA template. The protocol described in the supplemental methods was thorough and easy to follow. I appreciated the comments that added extra context. Using a single phosphorylated primer and lambda-exonuclease to generate the ssDNA template from a PCR product was simple and only added an extra hour or so to my usual protocol. The enzyme was cheap enough (~€70) and will be sufficient for 100s of reactions. The phosphorylated primer was about 5x more expensive than a standard primer but I think this added cost is worth the increase in efficiency.

For this reason, and because Nr5a2 is maternally provided (Gassler et al., Science 2022), can the authors rule out that Nr5a2 knockout zygotes still contain maternally provided Nr5a2 protein, which is sufficient for ZGA?

My assumption is that a like-to-like comparison is more suited if the full standard approaches are compared (i.e. I don't think people use the level 3 data all that often, so benchmarking against it is less valuable). I think MOAProfiler is likely to still outperform, but at a lower margin. 4. I agree that testing the generalizability is a very exciting application.
