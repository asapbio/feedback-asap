We agree that these signals should not be treated with ICA. For irregular FPs this is generally unnecessary. Now, statistical independence cannot be used as a generic argument, it must be measured whenever possible (e.g., modeling work), as was done in Makarova et al 2011). In practice, most users of ICA in EEG, fMRI, and intracranial FPs corroborate this (Bell and Sejnowski doi: 10.1162/neco.1995.7.6.1129.). The argument used here in l66-l68 that Glabska's modeled FP study only found ICA components of two populations in cortex is flawed. There are two errors. First, FPs are not population specific, but pathway-and-population specific. Any population can produce as many ICA components as input pathways produce FPs, which requires incoming activity to be coherent and spatially discrete distribution over the morphology of individual cells. Indeed, Torres et al (doi: 10.1093/cercor/bhz061) found some more components in cortex, but only two were local and have significant variance, others were minor and discarded for further consideration. Importantly, only a few populations in the brain have the appropriate geometry to produce FPs, which is the reason why they do not provide any IC, as has already been shown by several groups, including the authors themselves in previous detailed studies of cortical activity (see Herreras O doi : 10.3389/fncel.2023.1129097 and doi: 10.1093/cercor/bhac297). On the other hand, populations that do not generate FP do contribute MUA, so their aliquot part of MUA should be subtracted so as not to introduce error in any analysis that combines FP and MUA. That is probably unfeasible in experiments. Hope this helps better founding the study context.

I would like to state the following facts: 1. The GX_P2V virus has been published in Nature in 2020 (doi: 10.1038/s41586-020-2169-0). It is not a brand-new virus. 2. The GX_P2V(short_3UTR) mutant was published in Emerging Microbes & Infections in 2022 (doi: 10.1080/22221751.2022.2151383). This cell-adapted mutant is the actual isolate published in the Nature paper. So, the original GX_P2V virus was not isolated. Clearly the original GX_P2V virus in the pangolin sample has severe growth deficiency in Vero cells. 3. The GX_P2V virus is not a human pathogen, although, based on molecular and animal infection experiments, it can infect a broad spectrum of host species, like human, cat, pig, golden hamster, mouse, rat et al. There is no evidence of the original GX_P2V virus circulating in these animals, not even consider this GX_P2V(short-3UTR) mutant. Please refer to publications: EMBO J, doi: 10.15252/embj.2021109962 and J Virol, doi: 10.1128/jvi.01719-22. 4. The GX_P2V(short_3UTR) isolate is highly attenuated in in vitro and in vivo models. In Vero, BGM, and Calu-3 cell lines, the virus induced only mild cytopathic effects, notably failing to produce viral plaques even on the human lung cell line Calu-3. In golden hamster and BALB/c mouse models, the virus can infect the animals' respiratory tracts but did not result in any observable disease symptoms. The attenuated nature of GX_P2V(short_3UTR) was also validated in two distinct human ACE2-transgenic mouse models. Please refer to publications: Emerging Microbes & Infections, doi: 10.1080/22221751.2022.2151383 and J Virol, doi: 10.1128/jvi.01719-22. The attenuation of GX_P2V(short_3UTR) was also hinted in the Nature paper on the GX_P2V(short_3UTR) isolate (doi: 10.1038/s41586-020-2169-0). In Extended Data Figure 1, after infecting Vero cells for five days, GX_P2V caused noticeable cytopathic effects, but which were limited to cell rounding and mild cytolysis, which starkly contrasted with the severe cytopathic effects reported in SARS-CoV-2. 5. The public has developed a high level of population immunity against GX_P2V due to SARS-CoV-2 immunizations and infections. Collectively, the biological safety risk posed by GX_P2V(short_3UTR) is extremely low. I don’t think there is any immediate risk of spillover into the human population. Please refer to publication: J Med Virol, doi: 10.1002/jmv.29031. 6. Based on previous reports on ACE2 humanized mouse models with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, there is significant variability in the outcomes of infection in these models, a topic extensively documented in the literature. A single ACE2 humanized mouse model does not constitute a reliable paradigm for evaluating viral pathogenicity. While GX_P2V(short_3UTR) proved lethal in our mouse model, it's important to consider that it did not cause disease upon infecting two other distinct ACE2 humanized mouse strains. The findings reported in this paper do not alter the fundamental nature of GX_P2V(short_3UTR) as being highly attenuated. 7. Several other research groups have repeatedly reported the spillover risk of this virus based on its spike protein binding to human ACE2. Those reports have not caught much attention. In our study, using a unique lethal model, we inadvertently reinforced the perception that this virus has a strong tropism for human brains and causes 100% mortality. We need to revise this in the subsequent revision of the paper and provide additional clarification on the intrinsic attenuated nature of the virus. 8. The GX_P2V(short_3UTR) mutant is a promising live attenuated vaccine against pan-SARS-CoV-2.

The overarching aim is to create a global trophic pyramid of biomass, partitioned by food source. The authors collected a large dataset on diet composition from the literature and other sources, ensuring a broad taxonomic spread. They then estimate diet partitioning for major taxonomic groups (~class) by averaging species-level data, and further estimate partitioned food source biomass by multiplying with class-level biomass estimates. This is taken to be provide a representation of a trophic pyramid, and the findings are discussed in the light of this concept. The major claim of this study is that they find a middle-heavy trophic pyramid, with invertivory more prominent (by biomass) than herbivory. The study pursues a very interesting question in studying the trophic pyramid on a global level. The authors have invested a lot of effort in compiling a large dataset on species-level diet partitioning, and such a dataset would certainly be very valuable for species-level comparisons and analyses, such as the taxonomic distribution of feeding styles or the evolutionary history of feeding specialisations. However, such questions are not the focus of the present study. Rather, an attempt is made to convert this species-level dataset into a trophic pyramid of food source biomass. In the process, the authors make several sweeping assumptions and generalisations, resulting in analyses that are not at all well supported by the underlying data. First, the conversion of species-level data to class-level partitioning of food sources, by averaging the data from available species, assumes that the compiled species are representative of the group (class) as a whole, and that a simple species average would provide a meaningful group average. Both are highly doubtful and not supported by any data. Second, the assumption is made that the class-level partitioning of food sources can be transformed into a partitioning of diet biomass by a multiplication with that group’s estimated biomass value. However, this will yield the biomass of that specific partition (e.g., the combined bodymass of all vertebrate herbivores) and not the biomass of their diet. Third, species groups (and their biomass) are assigned to a trophic level by their food source type, which leads to the three categories “herbivores” (= primary consumers), “invertivores” (= secondary consumers) and “vertivores” (presumably considered as predators including apex predators as they are placed at the top of the pyramid in Fig. 2). This is a strong oversimplification and does not represent a trophic pyramid. Most worryingly, the category “invertivores” will lump many higher-level consumers (third-level, fourth-level…) into the secondary consumer category, which as a result has by far the highest proportion (= biomass in this analysis). Thus, one of the key claims of the study, that the global trophic pyramid is middle-heavy, is likely due to a methodological artifact. In summary, the study attempts a methodological shortcut for deriving a trophic biomass dataset from species-level data, without verifying the assumptions. At the current time, there appears to be no ready substitute for species-level abundance or biomass data. Until such data are available for the majority of organisms, analyses of trophic pyramids on a global level may be premature. Recommendations for the authors: As mentioned in my public review, I commend the authors on compiling such a large and potentially very valuable dataset on species-level diet partitioning. I believe such a dataset can be very informative for species-level analyses, or possible investigations into the evolution of such partitioning. However, such a dataset cannot be transformed into a trophic dataset without corresponding data on species abundances and/or biomass. Your attempts to perform this transformation without such data unfortunately fall short, as it requires a series of sweeping assumptions that are almost entirely unfounded by real-world data. I will attempt to explain my views in the sections below: Title The title is misleading: in the current form, the manuscript deals with many more analyses than the number of herbivore and predatory species in each class. Though as I mentioned, this species-level analysis is actually the most relevant (and valid) analysis in your study while the trophic pyramid aspect is not. Introduction You provide a very nice overview of the different concepts of trophic pyramids and their development over time. As you point out, all these variants of the pyramid include a measure of scale for each level, such as ‘abundance’, ‘biomass’, or ‘energy’. It is also implicit in this introduction that this concept considers multiple levels (L42: “…food chains…”, L45: “…and so on up to…”) and not just three as in your following analysis. Materials and Methods The success of the method hinges on the representativeness of selected species. This is highly unlikely, as data on diet composition will be much more readily available for large or well-studied organisms, which are not necessarily the ones that are the most important (by number or biomass) members of their class. The authors themselves acknowledge that for many groups, even with a minimum of ~500 species per group, still only ~0.3 to 1.3% of described species are covered for insecta, arachnida, mollusca and crustacea (L265-267). In addition, I would strongly argue that even with good taxonomic coverage, as is achieved for birds and mammals, calculation of the group average has to consider the highly differing abundance and/or biomass of separate species. To illustrate these points, I would like to highlight the study’s data on the arachnida (Figs. 1 and 4). About 20% of their diet is considered as “parasite vertebrate”, with a considerable biomass. Without knowing the details of the species that were considered, I would assume that the majority of these are ticks, as these feed on (mostly) vertebrate blood. Roughly speaking, we know of maybe 60 000 species of arachnida, of which perhaps 1000 are ticks. On the species level, ticks therefore seem to be highly overrepresented in the dataset, possibly because it is straightforward to infer their food source from their specialized morphology. On the other hand, the group arachnida does not seem to consider very many oribatid mites, of which there are around 12 000 known species that are almost exclusively detritivore. In addition, oribatid mites are known to be extremely abundant in soils, so their biomass is likely many times that of ticks. A similarly obvious over-representation in terms of diet and biomass occurs in the marine dataset with “vertivore crustacea”. Please note that I only picked some obvious examples here, but that the same issues will be prevalent in all animal groups. Indeed, I believe that your method “validation” using bird species data shows that your estimate can be very unreliable, even for a well-covered group such as birds. Your Results (L345-347) show that “the respective contribution of invertebrates and vertebrates switched from 56% and 8% in the estimate to 23% and 45% in the species-weighted partitioning”. These are very large differences. A further point I would like to raise: using an animal group’s biomass to gauge the biomass of the separate diet partitions seems to oversimplify matters. You are assuming that the body biomass equals the diet biomass. However, foods have very different nutritional content (e.g., carbohydrates/protein/fiber). A Panda and a Polar Bear may have fairly similar body weights, but the panda needs to eat much more plant matter biomass due to the poor nutritional content. Overall, the Methods section is a little disjointed, and is difficult to match to the Results section. Also, some of the chosen methods are not well justified or explained. E.g., - How were Wikipedia sources selected and “confirmed” (L130), or how was the literature searched (L132)? - How did you incorporate a diet category that only exists for a single class (“plant-derived, L150”)? - How did you deal with separate diet data for juveniles and adults (L157)? - L184ff: It remains unclear why you compare your global dataset to two location-specific datasets. What did you aim to achieve? A validation of the global dataset in this manner appears dubious, as local datasets may always remain location-specific. - What is your justification for collecting a further dataset on dinosaur diet? You mention that you aim “to test if herbivory is related to higher body mass and lower metabolic rate” (L206), but then compile only diet data for these dinosaurs (inferred from dental morphology, adding a further level of uncertainty), and no data on body mass or metabolic rate. In addition, I would think that your dataset on mammal diet composition would be much more suitable for this purpose, as it appears to be quite comprehensive and would include many species with “high” body mass. Also, in extant mammal the diet composition has presumably been directly quantified, and not just inferred from dental morphology. - L214ff: Why have a specific method for assessing human diet? We are just one more species in your dataset. - L223ff: The use of reptile biomass data for amphibians is not justified. Your assessment that the differences in average body mass and population density ‘cancel each other out’ cannot be verified. If you do not have a good biomass estimate for amphibians, you cannot include this group in the analysis. - L265ff: Your statistical “validation” of achieving representative data from poor species coverage is inappropriate. By sampling 0.3% of bird species 10 00 times and calculating an average, you merely verify that you can calculate a good average from ~300 000 (~30 species x 10 000), overall randomly sampled, data points. To “validate” your approach, you need to investigate the variance of your 10 000 repeat samples, which presumably is extremely large. - L265ff: The Methods appear to be incomplete here, as the Results section describes an analysis that was weighted by bird species biomass and abundance (L340). Results Throughout the manuscript, but particularly noticeable in the Results section, you are using misleading terms to refer to your data and results. I believe this stems from your multiple assumption to derive trophic pyramid data from a species-level dataset. E.g. - Fig.1: “species in most animal groups”; this figure shows the group average diet composition, not the species proportions. - L355: “partitioning of diets… expressed as biomass (Fig. 2)”; this figure actually shows the biomass of the trophic group, not their diet. - Etc. L333: “we assumed a homogenous distribution of biomass across trophic levels in each group” – a further example of an unfounded assumption that weakens your analyses and conclusions considerably. The data on dinosaur diet is missing from the Results. Discussion As outlined above, I believe that your main conclusion of a middle-heavy global trophic pyramid is not supported by your analyses, as are other conclusions on the trophic pyramid. Your study does not support the conclusion of a “paradigm shift” (cf. L407). Finally, some further minor comments: L173: what is the category “Food I”, and why is it relevant to mention these categories here? L311: Conservation areas might include some “important species” that are missing elsewhere, but that should not distract from the fact that species lists remain highly biased and incomplete there, as everywhere. Most obviously, Kruger NP is bound to have more than 13 species of insect (Fig. S4). And certainly such species list do not consider the microfauna to a meaningful degree. L402: It seems very unfair to disparage previous efforts as biased, when your own study is based on highly incomplete datasets and unfounded assumptions. L476f: I find the definition of a carnivore from Román-Palacios et al. in this context highly misleading. Heterotrophs include fungi, which does not make a fungivore a carnivore. L494: There might have been larger insects in the prehistoric past (at least we know of one large dragonfly), but that hardly makes them “megafauna”. L523: “a world without insect would potentially mark the end of complex life on Earth” – there is certainly complex life in marine environments, where insects are not prevalent and their potential decline might not have large impacts. L676: “more abundant” – you are not considering abundance here. Fig. S8: Here you are literally comparing a species group with a single species (humans). I presume that your reasoning is that the diet of humans has important impacts on the global food web. This is a nice case in point that you absolutely need species-level information on abundance/biomass to construct trophic pyramids and food webs.",2024-01-16T14:43:15,,Reviewer1,10.1101/2022.09.14.507913,The trophic pyramid revisited: most animal classes have more predator than herbivore species,"Tamir Klein, Stav Livne-Luzon, Uri Moran",2022-09-16

We started this nearly 10 years ago. The counterintuitive observation that the sequence of CREs that are active in more tissues were less conserved than the sequence of tissue-specific ones needed a solid explanation. We started with an avalanche of sanity checks. Remapped everything, re-evaluated peak-calling, included dinucleotide aware divergence measures, re-checked alignments. After we were convinced that the signal would not go away, we needed to find an explanation. We started to look for an unbiased measure of TFBS binding potential and add RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data from comparing macaques and humans. Finally, the fog cleared up showing that pleiotropic CREs show a higer functional conservation. It is just that this functional conservation of these large pleiotropic CREs is achieved by redundancy, thus TFBS are moving around and different locations got fixed in different species: i.e. compensatory evolution within the same CRE. Compensatory evolution has been suggested before as a common mode of evolution for CREs, it is only that for less pleiotropic elements this usually happens not within the same element, but between different CREs, i.e. the entire CRE jumps around.",2024-01-12T11:13:24,ineshellmann,Ines Hellmann,10.1101/2024.01.10.575014,Evidence for compensatory evolution within pleiotropic regulatory elements,"Zane Kliesmete, Peter Orchard, Victor Yan Kin Lee, Johanna Geuder, Simon M.

In section F.3, version 1, figures 19-26 show SPR binding affinity measurements for several dozen DNA variants per antibody.  The values plotted for -log10(KD)(M) appear to represent the sample mean of each set of four SPR measurements.  These figures could be improved by also including error bars representing the sample standard deviation of each set of four measurements. Including error bars is important because the precision and accuracy of SPR experiments varies depending upon experimental context.  Although some authors report standard deviations of +/-10% or better (see, for example, Table 1 in Brown, M.E. et al., (2020) ""Assessing the binding properties of the anti-PD-1 antibody landscape using label-free biosensors"" PLoS ONE 15(3) doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0229206), the repeatability of SPR experiments can be impaired by many experimental artefacts: baseline drift, bulk shift discontinuities, mass transport effects, non-specific binding, manufacturing batch variation of sensor chips or other consumables, fitting to an incorrect kinetic model, etc. If the measurement uncertainties are large enough, then the observations of stronger binding affinities than the reference antibodies may not be statistically significant.  Affinity values supposedly above the references could be explained away as random statistical noise around a true binding affinity which is actually left unchanged relative to the reference (presumably because the sequence mutations for those DNA variants ultimately had a neutral impact on the final shape of the folded antibody). This is a critical point, because if IgDesign does not actually produce mutant sequences with binding affinities signficantly above the reference, then it would weaken a key conclusion of the paper: in such a scenario, IgDesign would not be useful for affinity maturation.",2024-01-03T18:29:59,,anonymous,10.1101/2023.12.08.570889,In vitro validated antibody design against multiple therapeutic antigens using generative inverse folding,"Amir Shanehsazzadeh, Julian Alverio, George Kasun, Simon Levine, Jibran A.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.13.571314v1#comment-6357929084,biorxivstage,1,"We’ve provided a point-by-point response with your comments in italics and our responses in non-italics. 1.1 Introduction, 1st paragraph: Part of the controversy might be explained by disagreement of what reorganization means and that structural and functional reorganization are two types of reorganization. Comparison two microelectrode mapping experiments might also reveal that BOLD and neural electrical activity (spikes) are not directly comparable and might give different mappings. How else to explain the findings by Merzenich et al. or that 1 year after amputation in monkeys nearly whole BA3b responds to the stump (Manger et al., 1996)? We disagree with the a priori position of the reviewer that there must be reorganisation. Our lab has published multiple previous studies and opinion papers to build the conceptual framework we are exploring here for lack of cortical reorganisation (Kikkert et al., 2016; Makin et al., 2013, 2015; Makin & Krakauer, 2023; Muret & Makin, 2021; Root et al., 2022; Wesselink et al., 2019, 2022). We do not believe the controversy is semantic, nor that it stems from different methodologies. Indeed, we have previously published a study specifically designed to replicate and address Merzenich’s findings (Wesselink et al., 2022). Instead, a key advantage in human research is the ability to consider the persistent representation of the amputated limb which still very much dominates activity in the deprived cortex. In the present manuscript, we use state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods to address one outstanding issue in this controversy, which is the lack of longitudinal comparison in the same individual before, and several months after, amputation. Further, with respect to Manger et al., it is important to appreciate the difference between peripheral and central reinnervation. 1.2 Intro, line 81:""Decisive is a big word with N=2 which are patients with a long disease history and very special treatment after amputation! How might disease and treatment have contributed to altered representation before or maintained representation after amputation, respectively? This should be discussed in light of studies showing that specific prostheses, treatment including usage of the (phantom) hand, stimulation of adjacent body parts, etc. can reverse maladaptation and phantom limb pain. The strength of our argument is not simply determined by the sample size but by the quality of the evidence. This is a sentiment that has clearly been appreciated in animal studies, and non-human primates in particular. We provide the first longitudinal study to directly address the question – to what extent is the hand representation stable following amputation. We scanned each patient and 16 able-bodied control participants 4 times, allowing for both within- and between-subject comparisons. Across all of these comparisons, we see no evidence to suggest there are changes in the cortical representation of the hand or the lips in the deprived hand region. With regards to disease history and treatment, these are two things we address directly in the manuscript - we find little difference at baseline between our patients and our control group. Further, despite distinct treatment and disease progression (e.g. with respect to PLP), both patients showed the same representational resilience. In reference to the reviewer’s last comment, we have extensively published against the view that PLP has any relationship with cortical reorganisation. We invite the reviewer to read recent reviews we have written on this topic (Makin, 2021; Makin & Flor, 2020; Schone et al., 2022). 1.3 Results: I miss results from the toe mapping! Since the foot representation is distal to the hand representation, toe mapping is not directly relevant to our research question. Regardless, we did map the foot representation and found no qualitative difference from controls. 1.4 Discussion, line 400f: I think there is consensus among most researchers that functional reorganization not necessarily requires underlying structural reorganization. We clearly state the comment in reference to the results of another study (Zeiger et al., 2021). “For example, longitudinal mouse studies demonstrate that shifts in single-cell input preferences, due to deprivation or lesions, reflect the strengthening of existing neural connections, rather than structural reorganization (22)” 1.5 Lines 405ff: It should be discussed that BOLD mapping probably is not equivalent to microelectrode mapping (Disbrow et al., 2000; Huettel et al., 2004). You argue that top-down modulation might underly changed functional representations. Couldn't the same argument be applied here in that top-down or connections from the motor cortex during (imagined) movements modulate BA3b activation? The reviewer should note that imagined movements, as we demonstrate in the manuscript, do not result in increased S1 activation. We haven’t speculated in the manuscript on the driver of persistent representation in S1. We agree that the most likely candidate is the motor system, sending finger-specific efference input to S1. 1.6 Line 411f: I would say, it suggest the preservation of the structural connections determining the space for functional remapping. From where if not the motor cortex (or other top-down) shall the signal to SI come without tactile stimulation? Proof could come through stimulation of topographically corresponding neurons/nerves in spinal cord or thalamus (specific afferents). There is mounting evidence from stimulation of the peripheral nerve, the spinal cord and S1 directly, that the representation of the missing hand is functionally preserved. This has been extensively reviewed in Makin & Bensmaia, 2017. 1.7 Line 423:""functional integrity"" -- should it not read ""structural integrity""? No, we meant functional integrity. 1.8 Lines 433ff: But that is exactly how (functional) reorganization and phantom sensations have been proposed to be treated - to maintain meaningful input! Therefore, these two patients are explicitly not the decisive sample to deny reorganization after amputation. Also, Shone et al. (2021; Cognitive Neurology) stated: ""While today it is agreed that there is no simple relationship between somatosensory map reorganisation and PLP, the maladaptive plasticity theory dominated contemporary research on PLP for several decades. This theory provided clear predictions on how to treat phantom pain: if pain is caused by maladaptive reorganisation, then we need to reverse it to alleviate phantom pain. In that vein, several treatment approaches attempt to restore the representation of the missing hand by increasing the phantom hand’s motor control..."" We strongly disagree with the reviewer here and would encourage the reviewer to read much of the evidence, published in the last decade on this topic, arguing against any role of cortical reorganization in phantom limb pain (Kikkert et al., 2017; Makin et al., 2013; Makin & Flor, 2020). Regardless, as it relates to the present study, at the 6-month scan, Patient L had no phantom limb pain and Patient R had high phantom limb pain (see Table 1). Based on the reviewer’s comment, if PLP was associated with reorganization, they would expect Patient R to exhibit lip remapping within the deprived hand region. Yet, we see no evidence for any remapping of the lips in this patient, as compared to able-bodied controls, thus, contradicting the reviewer’s argument. Finally, the reviewer citing our recent review on phantom limb pain is misleading (Schone et al., 2022). In that paper, we provided the reader with an understanding of how others are designing current PLP treatments to target this “supposed” reorganization as a mechanistic target to reverse PLP. We clearly say in the quote given by the reviewer: “While today it is agreed that there is no simple relationship between somatosensory map reorganisation and PLP.”  We don’t support these treatments and have consistently argued against them because both the maladaptive theory and the behavioral therapies designed to target it are not supported by sufficiently reliable data (Makin, 2021; Schone et al., 2022). 1.9 Methods, Line 682f: Is it the M1 activity that is stabilizing the S1 functional reporesentation? Or is it top-down activation? The authors from (57) state: ""...important to also consider motor contributions to digit representation"". And they also show very different mappings for active and passive stimulation. It is likely both mechanisms (see our response above to peripheral and spinal cord stimulation). 1.10 Lines 690ff: Why do both paradigms result in similar maps? Is it not touch that is represented in BA3b? Or is it overwritten with information from motor cortex? Based on our previous work and others (Berlot et al., 2019; Sanders et al., 2023), differences in the surface on which the hand is resting do not trigger great differences in inter-finger selectivity.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.01.549754v1#comment-6357611460,biorxivstage,3,"New evidence supports the hypothesis that Borgs are incipient viral lineages (Claudiu Bandea, Dec 28, 2023) The discovery of Borgs as giant extrachromosomal elements, presumably inhabiting Methanoperedens archaea, was first published in 2021, in bioRxiv [1]. More than a year later, the study was also published in Nature under a slightly different title and content [2]. The study, which reported the sequencing and analysis of more than a dozen Borg genomes (661,708 to 918,293 kb in length), including four genomes that were fully curated and analyzed, found no evidence of viral characteristics. On the basis of these results, the authors asserted the following: “ We can neither prove that they are archaeal viruses or plasmids or minichromosomes, nor prove that they are not. Although they may ultimately be classified as megaplasmids, they are clearly different from anything that has been previously reported ” (all quotes in Italics) [2]. This statement raises a critical question: what kind of evidence would warrant the classification of Borgs as viruses, megaplasmids, or minichromosomes? Surprisingly, the authors did not address this essential issue. Despite the Borgs’ apparent lack of viral characteristics, in a commentary entitled “ Will Borgs Illuminate the Evolutionary Origin of Ancestral Viral Lineages? ” [3], I suggested that Borgs are incipient viral lineages and, thus, illuminate one of the biggest mysteries in biology – the origin of viruses. Remarkably, in a new article published in bioRxiv by the same group [4], we learn that, after all, Borgs do encode numerous putative viral proteins, including several capsid proteins, as well as proteins implicated in the replication, recombination, and spread of Borgs to new host cells. The new study presents additional evidence, including a high ratio between the number of Borgs and their presumed Methanoperedens hosts and a distinct methylation pattern of their genomes, which point to an extracellular stage in the Borgs’ life cycle and to their viral nature. As I outlined in my previous commentary [3], the rationale for proposing that Borgs might be incipient viral lineages, even in the absence of the conventional physical, biochemical, and biological features historically used to define viruses (see below), was rooted in the Fusion Hypothesis regarding the evolutionary origin of viruses [5-7]. According to this hypothesis, the ancestral or incipient viral lineages originated from ecto- or endo-symbiotic or parasitic cellular lineages that fused with their host cells. By fusing with their host cells and discarding their cellular membrane, these lineages transitioned to new type of biological organization and structure (see below), which gave them full access to the host cell resources, including the host’s ribosomes and other components of the translation machinery. After synthesizing their specific molecules and replicating their genome using the resources found in their special environmental niche (i.e., the host cell), this new type of organisms induced the assembly and morphogenesis of reproductive, transmissible forms, which started a new life cycle by fusing with other host cells. The absence of a cellular membrane within the host cell presented the incipient viral lineages with unique reductive evolutionary opportunities, not readily available for parasitic or symbiotic cellular lineages, which led to a myriad of new viruses with diverse lifestyles and biochemical composition. As outlined below, the fusion model completely changes the conventional views regarding the nature of viruses, their evolutionary origin, and their role in shaping the evolution of cellular lineages. The nature of viruses Ever since viruses were identified more than a century ago as infectious agents that passed through filters thought at that time to retain all microorganisms, they have been conceptually identified with the virus particles, or virions - the transmissible infectious forms in the viral life cycle. Accordingly, viruses have been defined based on the physical, biochemical, and biological properties of these particles, as illustrated in virtually all scientific literature and textbooks to date. For example, in his seminal book, The Molecular Biology of the Gene, James Watson, who was highly familiar with nucleic acids, as well as with viruses [8], wrote: “ All viruses differ fundamentally from cells, which have both DNA and RNA, in that viruses contain only one type of nucleic acid, which may be either DNA or RNA ” [9]. A decade later, in A Dictionary of Virology, viruses were defined as “ Infectious units consisting of either RNA or DNA enclosed in a protective coat ” [10], and in the 1990s, a classic microbiology textbook, Zinsser Microbiology, stated that viruses “ consist of a genome, either RNA or DNA, that is surrounded by a protective protein shel l” [11]. Surely, the authors of these scientific publications were fully aware that, during the intracellular stage of their life cycle, many viruses, such as the “DNA viruses” and retroviruses, have both type of nuclei acids, DNA as well as RNA, and that many viruses are much more complex than a nucleic acid wrapped in a protein coat. Yet, all these renowned scientists fell victim to the concept of viruses as virus particles and used the physical, biochemical, and biological properties of these particles to define viruses. This is a strong example of the power of concepts in science. A concept that clearly misrepresents the experimental findings and observations can persist for decades, or, as in the case of viruses, for more than a century. Forty years ago, in 1983, I proposed that, like many parasitic cellular lineages, viruses pass in their life cycle through two phenotypically distinct stages: the extracellular, reproductive forms represented by the virus particles, and the intracellular forms in which the viral molecules and components are “free” or dispersed within their host cell [5]. The viral particles are highly specialized structures that are used by some viruses for their transmission to new host cells. This role of viral particles in the viral life cycle explains their properties, including their apparent inert status and the presence of only one type of nucleic acid - DNA or RNA. Many viruses, however, do not produce viral particles, using instead alternative modes of transmission [12]. This fact alone indicates that identifying viruses with the virus particles misrepresents their nature. Nevertheless, the fundamental biological properties of viruses, whether they do or do not produce virions, are expressed during the intracellular stage of the viral life cycle, when viruses replicate their genome and synthesize their specific molecules, many of which are not components of the viral particles. To identify viruses phenotypically during the intracellular stage of their life cycle with the integrative sum of all their molecules, and to differentiate them conceptually from the parasitic lineages that maintain a cellular membrane within the host cell, I proposed the concept of molecular structure and labeled viruses as molecular organisms [5, 6]. Although the concepts of molecular organisms and molecular structure (which, by analogy with the host cell’s cytoplasm, can be called viroplasm) are more suggestively envisioned within the framework of the fusion hypothesis, these concepts are also applicable in context of the other hypotheses regarding the origin and evolution of viruses (see below). Significantly, these concepts set the foundation for including other biological entities, such as plasmids, endogenous viruses, and viroids, within the same domain of biological organization - the viral domain. In a commentary entitled “ What makes a virus a virus? ” [13], Roland Wolkowicz and Moselio Schaechter  wrote that the identity of viruses as historically conceptualized and defined (i.e., as virus particles) is missing “ the most fundamental aspect of what makes a virus a virus: it breaks up and loses its bodily integrity, with its progeny becoming reconstituted after replication from newly synthesized parts ” and that “ We are surprised from our own experience that the world of virology has not fully embraced this outlook ” . After the discovery of giant viruses, Jean-Michel Claverie asked, “ What if we have totally missed the true nature of (at least some) viruses? ” [14], and in a series of publications Patrick Forterre and his colleagues have discussed extensively the limitations of the concept of viruses as virus particles and suggested alternative ways to define viruses and to identify them during the intracellular stage of their life cycle [15-18]. As I discussed in the original publication [5], referring to the intracellular stage of viruses as an “eclipse phase,” denoting the “disappearance” of viruses, was confusing. Likewise, identifying viruses with their genome, thereby ignoring the other viral molecules and components, misrepresents their nature. An alternative approach was to no longer refer to a virus as an individual biological entity, but as an integrated virus-host cell system (i.e., the infected cell0. Recently, Patrick Forterre labeled this integrated system with the term “ virocell ” [15, 17, 18]. This approach was sharply criticized by Purificación López-García and David Moreira on both scientific and epistemological grounds [19, 20], and recently the virocell term was redefined by DeLong et al., [21], but Forterre rebutted the criticism [18]. Nevertheless, these highly relevant discussions bring forward the acute problems with the dogma of viruses as virus particles and stress the need for a new scientific and academic perspective on viruses, which can productively integrate the extraordinary amount of knowledge about viruses and their role in shaping the life and evolution of their hosts and of the ecosystem in which their live [15, 22-30]. The scientific limitations and academic confusion associated with the concept of viruses as virus particles in virology and related biomedical fields [31-33] remain to be fully addressed. However, questioning the validity of this dogma, which has guided several generations of researchers to extraordinary discoveries and progress in virology, is challenging. The origin and evolution of viruses As it would be expected, in the context of the dogma of viruses as virus particles, the hypotheses regarding their evolutionary origin focused on the virions and their structure: (i) the Pre-cellular or Virus-first Theory suggested that viruses originated from precellular, self-replicating nucleic acids, or replicons, encoding for capsid proteins; (ii) the Endogenous or Escape Hypothesis suggested that viruses originated from cellular genomic sequences, or replicons, encoding for capsid proteins; (iii) and the historical Regressive or Reductive Hypothesis proposed a reductive transition of parasitic cellular lineages, such as bacteria, into nucleocapsid-like structures. Within the concept of viruses as virus particles, the validity of the regressive hypothesis was questionable as Salvador Luria and James Darnell pointed out more than half a century ago: “ The strongest argument against the regressive origin of viruses from cellular parasites is the non-cellular organization of viruses. The viral capsids are morphogenetically analogous to cellular organelles made up of protein subunits, such as bacterial flagella, actin filaments, and the like, and not to cellular membranes.” [34]. Indeed, many parasitic and symbiotic bacteria have a fraction of the genomic and proteomic repertoire of some viruses. For example, several endosymbionts, such as Carsonella, Hodgkinia, and Tremblaya, have a genome that is less than 200 kb and encode less than 200 proteins [35]. Yet, no symbiotic or parasitic bacteria with highly reduced genomes and metabolic capability resemble virus particles. As predicted by the fusion hypothesis, only symbiotic or parasitic lineages that have a genetic and metabolic system compatible with that of their host cells would be able to fuse with them and transition to a viral type of biological organization. Accordingly, only bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic lineages, hosted by bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic host cells, respectively, could evolve into viral lineages [6, 7, 36]. Interestingly, numerous symbiotic and parasitic lineages that inhabit their kin and have reduced genomes and metabolic capabilities have been recently discovered, including highly diverse groups of DPANN archaea and CPR bacteria [37-42]. Hypothetically, some of these archaeal and bacterial lineages are in the process of transitioning into incipient viral lineages [6, 36], similar to the putative cellular ancestors of Borgs [3]. Nevertheless, one of the major appeals of the fusion hypothesis is that, unlike the other hypotheses, it can be addressed experimentally, as some members of these groups archaea and bacteria could be developed as fusion model organisms. Surprisingly, though, the strongest evidence for the fusion hypothesis is found among more complex organisms - the eukaryotes. According to the fusion model, the nucleomorphs, some of which have a very small genome (<1 Mb) [43], originated from algal endosymbionts that fused with their host cells. Although, currently conceptualized as organelle-like entities, the nucleomorphs are genuine molecular organisms that have maintained their nucleus. Even more surprising is the fact that numerous parasitic algal and fungal lineages have a life cycle and biological organization that, as I previously pointed out [6], represent overwhelming evidence for the fusion hypothesis. Indeed, several obligate parasitic species of red algae fuse with their host cells and use the host resources, including, in my assessment, the host ribosomes and other components of the translational machinery, to synthesize their molecules, replicate their genome, and induce the morphogenesis of spore-like progenies [44-50]. I cannot overemphasize the significance of these discoveries which support the fusion hypothesis and should be considered breakthrough discoveries not only in the field of parasitology, but also in evolutionary science, and biology. Many viruses have been discovered serendipitously, including the recent finding in Chaetognaths, a small phylum of marine invertebrates, of two complex viruses, which have yet to be characterized at the molecular level [51, 52]. As more investigators become familiar with the fusion hypothesis and its predictions, it is likely that new types of viruses, as well as of new cellular lineages that are transitioning into incipient viral lineage, will be discovered. Although, similar to tens of thousands of symbiotic and parasitic cellular lineages, the viral lineages have evolved towards reduced genomes and proteomes, there is clear evidence of frequent exchanges of genetic material with their hosts and other coinfecting organisms [6, 7, 53]. Considering also their high mutational rates, the deep phylogenetic analysis of viruses is inherently difficult [54-58]. Therefore, trying to establish deep phylogenetic relationships among viruses, reaching the origin and early evolution of life, is likely to be a futile effort. The origin of incipient viral lineages from symbiotic or parasitic cellular lineages by a fusion mechanism is consistent with the current sequence-based phylogenetic analysis indicating orthologous relationships between the genes of some complex viruses and those of their hosts. The fusion hypothesis is also consistent with the complex biology and the life cycle of many viruses [59-62]. Also, unlike the virus-first, and the escape hypotheses, which dominate the current scientific literature [57, 63-65], the fusion hypothesis is consistent with the reductive evolution of thousands of endosymbiotic/parasitic microorganisms, which prompts the critical question: Why would viruses evolve in the opposite way? Unlike the other two hypotheses on the evolutionary origin of viral lineages, the fusion hypothesis also unambiguously addresses one of the most intriguing scientific and philosophical questions: Are viruses alive? If the viral lineages originated from cellular microorganisms as proposed in the fusion model, then, there are few remaining arguments, if any, against their living status and their rightful place on the Tree of Life [5-7, 66-68]. Finally, it is relevant to mention that the fusion model on the origin of viral lineages is an integral part of a broader perspective - the fusion/anti-fusion theory - regarding the origin and evolution of pre-cellular and cellular lineages, including the archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic cellular domains and some of their defining characteristics [7]. Many aspects of this unifying theory, which addresses the major transitions in the history of life, including its origin, can be found as discrete published ideas and hypotheses [69-74]. Luria’s Credo : There is an intrinsic simplicity of nature and the ultimate contribution of science resides in the discovery of unifying and simplifying generalization, rather than in the description of isolated situation - in the visualization of simple, overall patterns rather than in the analysis of patchworks [75].

I would like to draw attention to previous evolutionary selection experiments in other model species, especially zebrafish, that the authors either do not cite or I think misrepresent. The authors for example refer to Uusi-Heikkilä et al. (2015) saying that the positive size selected zebrafish became shyer. But if you look carefully at the paper, the positive size selection treatment did not differ from the controls (no effect on personality), while it was the negative size selection that became bolder. A number of follow up studies on the behavioural response were completed, several papers (not cited by the authors) first authored by Valerio Sbragaglia and later by Tamal Roy. Imporantly, examining boldness effects was found to be strongly context-dependent for the positive size selection line. In some cases there were strong trends for it to become bolder, consistent with the fast life history, but in the presence of predation threat, either no differences to control or shyer behaviour was found (e.g., Sbragaglia et al. 2022, Am Nat). Very consistently, the negative size selection line was found to be always bolder. So, in short, there was an asymetric selection response and a strong context dependency of the behaviorual effects in the positive size selection line. Importantly, the results did not disagree with the expectation (e.g., fast life history should be bolder) as claimed in this manuscript, but ecological context in which the experiment was completed moderated the response. Very consistent was the finding that the negative size selected line was consistently bolder. Imporantly, theory as shown in Andersen et al. (2018) showed that positive size selection with our without additional behavioural selection may bring about either bolder or shyer behaviour, depending on the size at which selection acts and which traits are under selection. I raise this to perhaps more critically evaluate past research and to compare your outcomes with our experimental evolutionary experiments to provide the full picture.",2024-01-01T14:00:13,robertarlinghaus,Robert Arlinghaus,10.1101/2023.11.28.569017,"Size-dependent harvest mortality indirectly affects boldness, feeding rate, and behaviour-linked gene expression in a decade-long selection experiment on guppies","Beatriz Diaz Pauli, Valentina Tronci, Ana S.

I enjoyed reading your paper and found it very informative. One comment I had was regarding line 255 of the manuscript where you assess kinase activity of the recombinant T474I and L528W mutants by monitoring Y551 phosphorylation; my understanding was that this site is typically phosphorylated by upstream kinases and that Y223 is an autophosphorylation site and therefore a better measure of kinase activity. I suppose since it was an in vitro assay it was not confounded by the presence of other kinases but I wonder if the Y223 would have shown discordant activity with Y551, particularly for the T474I mutant.

It is great to see that your lab is also now coming to this conclusion. There are a few details regarding the implementation that make a difference, but that are not clear to us from reading your manuscript. You do not mention how you report protein-protein interactions in the fused approach. Additionally, the level of crosslinks (CSM, peptides, residues) is not specified. Crucially, although the manuscript demonstrates a clear effect, it lacks a mechanistic explanation for the observed outcomes - both the lack of decoys in the non-fused and the recovery of decoys in the fused case. Further questions include: How are N-terminal errors accounted for? Why did you change your previous FDR formula to the one employed by us and others (and will you revise previous work accordingly...)? Finally, you are not comparing your results to those obtained by FDR boosting. This would be valuable, as FDR boosting can offset at least the gains attributed to context-sensitive subgrouping by the (corrected version of) mi-filter.

They use this pipeline to segment single cells and extract both single-cell and 3D-based features. The authors also pursue three application experiments, in which they expose cells to osmotic stress, topology modifications, and different gravity forces. We read this paper as part of a journal club, and have decided to compile a collective review and publicly share it with the authors. This was inspired by the Arcadia Science Preprint Review Pizza Party Initiative, and this represents our third preprint review. Overall, our review focuses on the need for additional clarity, strengthening methodological justifications, and an increased discussion about potential implications of the findings and techniques used. We provide several specific comments below: - The authors discuss “database architecture” (line 99, and throughout) but they do not provide any additional details on the architecture nor the technology used. Without these details, it is difficult to understand the role and functionality of the database in relation to the pipeline. - The authors describe their pipeline effectively, but they do not disclose any potential limitations or challenges. How user-friendly is the pipeline? Is it reproducible and interpretable? Will the pipeline work with other spheroid or organoid types? - The pipeline tool describes the power of flexibility. Users can enrich the database with additional features of their choice, but what benefit does this flexibility provide? Does having more features improve results? Does the software provide guidance to a user on how to decide these parameters? - The authors discuss that previous tools do not disclose compute time, but then they use a publicly available tool (StarDist) and report compute time. It is unclear how the authors improve compute time independently of these other tools. The authors also do not benchmark the full run time and resource usage of their framework. - The authors extensively discuss quality control, but they do not describe any impact of uneven illumination on the cell images. Do the images suffer from uneven illumination? Would illumination correction improve segmentation and feature extraction? - It appears that the authors are actually using spheroids and not organoids, but the terms are used interchangeably, which could be misleading. - The authors should consider making OrganoProfiler open source to increase community impact, and the authors should properly cite other open source software like VTAE and KNIME. Many other software tools are properly cited, thank you! - In line 546, the authors state: “...realistic simulated 3D image data…” but details on how they created the images and indicators if the simulation worked are lacking. Similarly, because the model was trained on these simulated images, how do the authors understand and trust accuracy metrics? - In line 610 the authors state: “In each image, an expert counted the nuclei that were missing and those with a significant precision issue in their contours, which exceeded 30% of the total nucleus area.” It is unclear why the authors chose precision over other metrics (e.g., IoU). Also, what were the expected error rates of the expert annotator and how might this impact performance interpretation? - We had several comments about clarity and claims that the paper makes in the discussion. The paper states: “Overall, our approach demonstrates a powerful and efficient methodology for imaging, analyzing, and extracting biological information from 3D cellular microsystems.” These are a lot of different focus areas, and it is not clear in which area the tool specifically innovates. Furthermore, the authors state that “large amounts of data can be analyzed with their approach”, but there are no benchmarking or resource usage details. Additionally, the authors state that they have developed a “groundbreaking method” but it is not clear what the authors are doing differently than what is already known/standard practice. Is it the collection of tools in a framework? Lastly, the authors declare no conflict of interests, but it is unclear how QuantaCell might factor in. For example, is QuantaCell a private company selling the software presented here? - We have several specific comments on select figures: Figure 1: The authors segment cytoplasm with Actin, but this may not be the best stain for all cell types. How would a user determine which cytoplasm stain to use if Actin is not a good option or is unavailable? Figure 2d is not mentioned in the text, and there is a typo in the y axis “median z-plan” Figure 3: The authors need to state how many organoids they used for the roundness analysis in Figure 3a - if this shows a single organoid then this approach may not be generalizable. Figure 3b says “2 distinct organoids per condition”, but there are only two curves. Showing one curve per organoid would help determine generalizability. Figure 3c depicts 10 organoids but the authors do not specify how they were selected Figure 4: Could the changes in cellular topology and morphology be due to the changes in oxygen exchange in the molds? Figure 5: Methodological details on measurements would help us understand what was transformed via PCA? Additionally, more details on controls are needed. We also have concerns about extensive user modification of data. We suggest making these modifications transparent and public. Without access to software it will be difficult to determine how the software works given that the data are modified.Without access to software it will be difficult to determine how the software discourages this practice. Also, the authors show only PC1; what is the expected explained variance of PC1? What signals are left in the other components?

You say 'Some Amazonian species have been shown to sing as infrequently as twice in 50 days (Jirinec et al. 2018).'

It is true that the bird only vocalized twice while it was being located, but the paper also notes that it was tracked during daylight hours to determine its space use throughout the day.  In contradiction to the point you are trying to make, Grallaria varia seems to sing quite reliably before dawn (e.g. https://pstoufferbirds.file....

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.05.556422v3#comment-6345731619,biorxivstage,3,"In the previous comment (mtg7x7eXMb) posted on September 29th 2023 [1] to the earlier version of this manuscript (September 8th 2023, [2]), that can be found by clicking on the previous version of the Kim et al preprint https://www.biorxiv.org/con..., it was suggested that when increases in radiotracer uptake (SUV) in a given organ are accompanied by increases in radiotracer concentration in the plasma, it is necessary to adopt mathematical modeling techniques to extract the specific component from the non-specific component of the Time-Activity-Curves (TAC), in order to generate an estimate of the binding potential BP (the latter defined as the product of the ligand affinity (KA) and the molarity of the gp120 receptors in tissues (R0)). The modeling work by Mintun and colleagues in the early 80s shows that increases in probe uptake in the blood without changes in binding potential, leads to increases in SUV in the tissues but not to an increase in the ratio of the SUV in tissues over the SUV in the blood (relative-SUV). In other words, if an increase in SUV in a given organ takes place concomitant to an increase in SUV in the blood without changes in the ratio, the latter points to a fully non-specific component of the increase in SUV uptake in that particular tissue. The reason for my suggestion was because the images of the manuscript [2] clearly showed that increases in probe uptakes in several tissues were concomitant to an increase in blood pool activity uptake (which could be obtained through an ROI placed on the aortic outflow tract, which closely follows the uptake of the Heart,  and that we will call, for simplicity in this document, as Heart SUV or blood-pool-activity BPA SUV), although the BPA SUV levels were not reported in the earlier version. On November 17th, the authors posted a new version of the Kim et al. pre-print [2], in which they have now disclosed in Supplemental Figure S3B and S3C the SUV of the Heart as well as the SUV of other organs normalized on the SUV of the Heart. Other criticisms in the previous September 29th comment [1] were also addressed by the authors who made several changes in their previous 2022 publication Samer et al. [3] (with respect to which, the current pre-print [2] is a follow up study) first on November 8th (by posting new supplementary  files to modify videos, the fourth based on History Versions)) and later on November 22nd through an erratum corrige posted by the JCI-Insight. Through these corrections, the authors agreed that video 5\Figure 3F and video 8 of the previous versions (up to November 8th) of the Samer et al. [3]were incompatible, hence that there is no evidence of increase in probe uptake (post Galunisertib administration) in the Heart of any of the seven imaged animals;  they also realized that the correct scale used to display the images of the 2022 publication was 0-1.0 SUVwb not 0-1.5 SUVwb like stated in the earlier versions (consistent with the content of the earlier September 29th comment [1]).  See more under note z-1. The reason why the scale-correction does not show up in the erratum corrige published on November 22nd on the JCI-Insight website, is because the scale had been originally disclosed only in the legend of the supplemental material files, but not on the Figures or legends or text of the main paper, but  changes in supplemental material are in general allowed without an erratum corrige, the latter being the only editorial tool that can keep track of the changes made in each version. This is a policy followed by some  scientific journals, but its rationale is not clear to me as it seems to go against enhancing transparency in scientific publishing. Indeed, this change from 1.5 down to 1.0 seems relevant, because the new scale highlights a new concern about the images published in the 2022 [3] (which we now know that it displays images with scale 1.0) and the 2023 articles [2] (which displays images with scale 1.5, not 1.0).  The baseline images (images acquired before the first Galunisertib administration) in the 2023 pre-print [2] reveal evidence of higher uptake in the heart compared to the images published in the 2022 paper [3]…the hearts appear more greenish in the 2023 pre-print Figure 2A\S1 Nov 17th version [2] and more blueish in the 2022 paper  Figure 3 [3]. This difference is even more evident after we have now been informed that the SUV scale used to display images of the 2022 publication [3]  is 1.0 and not 1.5.  In other words, the two studies [2, 3], based on the newly corrected SUV scales, are showing clear evidence of differences in half-life of the radiotracer circulating in the plasma of the animals at 24 hr post radiotracer injection (higher Heart uptake (BPA) means longer half-life of the radiotracer). Could biophysical differences of the radiotracers used in- the 2022 and 2023 papers explain these seemingly different half-lives? Moreover, the new Figures S3B and S3C of [2]  show that, as opposite to the absolute SUV levels, the relative-SUV levels are not statistically significantly increased at the later cycles of the Galunisertib administration, which confirms the weakness of the SUV mathematical operator, alone, in highlighting areas of specific uptake (a notion that resonates with a popular paper in nuclear medicine literature: SUV, standard uptake or Silly Useless Value…? ). In absence of dynamic modeling of the TAC(t), the latter evidence points to a fully non-specific uptake of the probe in those organs for the reasons explained above, hence, additional validation techniques (discussed in the previous comment [1]) would need to be provided before claiming again, as we read in the conclusion of the new version of the pre-print, that this dataset ”demonstrates that the Galunisertib-driven increases in SUV were mostly specific, ..(and with the new data presented as) consistent with previous studies validating the specificity of the PET signal for areas of enhanced SIV replication in gut  and lymph nodes(Santangelo et al Nature Methods 2015 [4], Santangelo et al Mucosa Immunol. 2018 [5] and Samer et al JCI-Insight 2022 [3])”, i.e. before concluding that the new data supports the three previous non-human primate studies that fueled the rationale of the current pre-print study, and whose reproducibilities were questioned in the September 29th comment [1]. In my opinion, the three earlier nonhuman primate studies  [3-5]  and the new corrections made by the authors after the September 29th comment [1] reveal a possible common denominator that I will try to articulate in the next lines. The first two nhp studies (Santangelo et al.  Nature Methods 2015[4] and Santangelo et al. Mucosa Immunol 2018[5]) showed increase in the anti-env probe uptake of the blood pool (heart, BPA) of SIV infected animals, but the SUV levels of organs normalized on SUV levels of the Heart were not presented in those studies either. Based on the mean levels described for instance in Figure 1G of [4], the average increase in SUV in LNs of SIV infected animals compared to uninfected control is lower than the average increase in SUV of the Heart, hence the ratios (SUV of LNs over SUV Heart= BPA, relative-SUV) will most likely be lower or unchanged in the infected animals compared to the uninfected animals in both publications,  which again points to a fully non-specific nature of the increase in uptake seen in those organs of the infected hosts. With respect to the third 7d3 study [3], as discussed in the September 29th comment [1], the images of the seven animals published in that 2022 article before and after Galunisertib administration show that the increase in uptake post-Galunisertib can be, in principle, fully explained by non-specific uptake of the probe. Specifically, the increase in uptake in LNs could well be explained by unintentional subcutaneous administrations of the probe (as visible in the post-Galunisertib images, but not in the pre-Galunisertib images). The main reason for my conviction that those uptakes are not related to binding of the probe to the gp120 is that increases in probe uptakes post-Galunisertib are seen only in the clusters of lymph nodes close to those injection sites that show evidence of subcutaneous injection of the probe but they are not seen in other clusters of lymph nodes (and with the latter unintentional mistake made, coincidentally, only for images acquired post-Galunisertib administration). This evidence, alone, should be sufficient to present the extravasation due to an unintentional subcutaneous injection of the probe as a reasonable explanation for the observed increases in LNs probe uptake post-Galunisertib, as further articulated in that comment [1]. The latter, in conjunction with other evidence in antibody imaging literature cited and articulated in the previous comment [1], points also to a non-specific nature of the probe uptake in gut seen in some of the imaged animals post-Galunisertib administration. Another reason for my conviction, as also articulated in the previous comment, is that higher doses for longer period of administration in the 2023 study [2] did not produce in any of the 8 animals (after cycles 1) those high probe uptakes seen in the 2022 paper [3] (in which only one cycle was administered in most animals). To recap, none of the 7 animals of the Samer et al. 2022 paper [3] showed evidence of increase in the (absolute) SUV of the Heart, and there are reasons to believe that the increases in probe uptakes seen in LNs and the gut of the same paper are fully non-specific. This is similar to what the authors reported following the first cycle of the Galunisertib in the 2023 Kim et al. pre-print [2], in which , in fact, no statistically significant increases in absolute SUV levels were found in any tissue compartment, nor in the heart. So, the Samer et al.[3] images and the images of the first cycle in the Kim et al. pre-print [2] show whole-body biodistribution properties that are different from those seen in the images of the 2015 and 2018 monkey studies [4, 5] as well as in the later cycles of the 2023 pre-print study [2] in which animals showed increase in absolute SUV levels in tissues concomitant to increase in SUV levels of the Heart. In other words, if we agree that the increases in uptake in the LNs of the anti-env probe in Samer et al 2022 paper [3] would not be visible in those published images, had the needle of the i.v. injection been properly inserted into the vein, the common denominator of all these studies is that the SUV levels increase in the tissues only in animals in which the SUV levels of the heart also increase. A well posed question seems: what could cause changes in SUV levels of the heart? In general, as anticipated above, higher SUV levels in the heart, or blood pool activity, means longer half-life of the radiotracer.  Factors that could lead to increase in half-life of radiolabeled antibody\F(ab’)2 fragments include changes in isoelectric point ,  changes in the molecular weight of the radiotracer, level of dissociation of the radioisotope in the preparation or in vivo.  Radio-HPLC analysis of the radiolabeled compounds could help to exclude that changes in preparations of the radiotracers are behind changes in probe uptake of the Heart at 24 hr (for the [3] and [2]) or at 36 hr (for [4, 5]) post radiotracer injection. In the Samer et al [3] or in the new pre-print ,[2], based on what we read in the Methods sections, no pegylation was performed. But the latter was performed in the earlier two anti-env imaging studies [4, 5] . Pegylation can, in principle, change molecular size, isoelectric point, clearance, half-life of a modified probe…. The letter “p” is not defined in the article [3] but based on this PhD thesis online https://www.proquest.com/do... or the website www.resourcenhpir.com of the program that distributes these probes, it indicates the primatized version of the murine 7d3. Not only the new probe is a F(ab’)2 fragment, but it is based on a primatized version of the 7d3 (not on the murine intact IgG1 version used in the earlier two studies [4, 5]) and, for the reasons discussed above, it appears that it was not pegylated. Given all these differences, it would help not only to provide evidence that its binding affinity is retained but also  that the product is stable and most of the radioactivity in the product is explained by the radiolabeled protein, including in vivo. These data were not provided in any of the five monkey imaging studies so far in literature (by including in this count the 2023 pre-print), produced from the same imaging team, claiming the feasibility of imaging the virus in vivo using anti-env radiolabeled probes and nuclear medicine cameras [2-6] . Moreover, the whole-body radiotracer retention could, in principle, highlight other differences in the preparations of the radiotracers. Indeed, the evidence that with SUV scale =1, most images of the 2022 papers reveal a liver that is green and some animals a kidney that is also green (hence with an SUV less than 1, because to be 1 or above 1 the organ must be red when displayed on a rainbow scale 0-1), suggests that there is quite low radiotracer retention in the body at only 24 hours post radiotracer injection. Why the radiolabeled fragment clears out of the body so fast? So, If the images have been correctly reconstructed with proper decay correction, it appears that the SUV levels in the whole-body are much lower than one would expect at baseline with a F(ab’)2 radiolabeled protein. This could happen for instance if the radionuclide dissociated early post radiotracer injection, and would be immediately excreted from the body without leaving traces of it. Only dynamic and serial imaging during the first 24 hours could highlight this phenomenon. If that is the case, i.e. if a high significant portion of the injected dose is excreted soon, QC data for each radiosynthesis would need to be carefully reviewed. Note-z1. Note, while changes were made on November 8th in Figures and Supplemental material files of the Samer et al 2022 [3] paper, the main text is, for some reasons, still left unchanged, which would make the reading of the article very difficult (given the changes made in some of the Figures and video links), for instance there is still reference to video 9 or reference to changes in the heart, NALT and spinal chord of A14X004…. A new link has been however added to the JCI-Insight Samer et al [3] called Supplemental data-2 https://insight.jci.org/art..., highlighting the corrections that need to be made to the main text to make it compatible with the new changes made on the Figures as well as on the Supplemental Figures\Videos, although the reason for this unusual editorial format (changes to the main text reported in a supplemental material link rather than directly on the main text of the paper online) is unclear. The erratum corrige https://insight.jci.org/art... added by the Editor states : “ Figure 3F and Supplemental Video 5 were incorrectly scaled by the analytical software due to an input error”, and “In the online version, Supplemental Video 5 has been updated. The original Supplemental Video 8 showed the correct scaling of animal A14X004 and has been removed to avoid redundancy.”; In my opinion, however, it is not correct to state that the original Supplemental Video 8 (published on November 2022, up to November 8th 2023 version) showed the correct scaling of animal A14X004, because it was stated, up to the version preceding the November 8th 2023 version, that the scale was 1.5 not 1.0, consistent with the content of the September 29th comment [1]). So to enhance transparency a more appropriate  explanation seems the following  “The original Supplemental Video 8 of animal A14X004 was displayed with a lower scale than the one stated in the earlier version, like it was the case for the images of all other animals in the previous version of the paper, but Video 8 has been removed in the new version to avoid redundancy with Video 5\Figure 3F”. Even the latter explanation for the erratum corrige would not be sufficiently clear to the readers that have not read the previous versions. As explained above and in the earlier comment, [1], the video 5 and video 8 were dual representations of the same animal (A14X004) displayed with different SUV scales, because the objective was to highlight small differences in low levels uptakes between baseline and post-Galunisertib administration in organs, like the gut, that could not be well visualized by keeping all the organs in the same field of view with a low SUV scale. After the erratum corrige, one would still expect to be able to appreciate those differences (e.g. increase in gut uptake) with the earlier dual representation, which now is missing. Indeed, it is not possible to appreciate such differences in the gut of the new Video 5.  In other words, the two representations did not seem “redundant”, because the original dual representation was an attempt made to convey a new information about the whole-body biodistribution of A14X004. Note, the corrigendum also states : “Data from baseline (BL) and post-galunisertib weeks 1 and 2 (W1/2) were compared using Wilcoxon matched pairs nonparametric test, and the differences were nonsignificant with α > 0.05. The authors regret the errors.” However, there seems to be no explanation in the Methods section on how the SUV data are treated for animals that were imaged at both week 1 and week 2, and what statistical analyses were run (Wilcoxon or a mixed-effect model with the Holm-Šídák multiple comparisons test?). Finally, the removal of the NALT SUV analysis in the new version is a bit surprising, because, although there is evidence of PET and CAT misalignment for this animal, the latter is visible only at week 2, so it is not clear why baseline and week 1 SUV analysis of the NALT were also removed from Figure 3H. Note, as stated elsewhere in this document, that while the text of the 2022 Samer et al. paper is still unmodified, the Figures and videos have been all updated. However, the PMC link version of the paper https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go... still shows the older video 5 (scaled 0-0.3) and the older video 8 (by mistake placed in the video 1 link, now the new video 5 of the new version post-erratum-corrigendum of the Samer et al. 2022 JCI Insight publication [3]) or the older Figure 3H. Note, that Supplementary Figure S8 and video 8 of the new version  ( JCI-Insight on November 22 2023 to the Samer et al 2022 [3]) still show rainbow scale 1.5, not 1.0 as stated in the new legends. Changing the scale from 1.5 down to 1.0  would further increase those red levels on the images for this “control” animal and highlight (although with n=1 only) potentially important differences in whole-body biodistribution of the isotype matched pIgG1 control (whose catalogue number or chemical nomenclature is missing in both papers [2, 3]) compared to the anti-env probe, not explained by its affinity to an irrelevant antigen. Finally, we read in Samer et al 2022 [3]“Two additional rhesus macaques, A8L057 and 08M171, were infected with SIVmac239M2 …and used as controls for, respectively, Supplemental Figures 8 and 9 at, respectively, weeks 56 and 32 postinfection” ; 08M171 is also an ID in the 2023 pre-print [1]. This looks an editing mistake, the descriptions of the infection timeline for 08M171 in the two publications are indeed incompatible. 1.	mtg7x7eXMb, comment to Kim, ...Villinger, Martinelli  BioRxiv September 8th 2023. 2023. 2.
