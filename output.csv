We incorporated some of your suggestions to add more context to discoveries made by your group and others regarding Cav1 in Ewing Sarcoma- appreciate the suggestions! In our studies, the subset of CD99 High cells we characterized do indeed have caveolae- so in contrast to previous studies- we believe the signaling in these cells do depend on caveolae per se and not just Caveolin-1 expression. Thanks also for the comment on other signaling pathways- MAPK levels were low in our hands for all these cells (CD99 High or Low)  but maybe worth revisiting.

Supplementary Figure 1: The authors describe the injection of 300 ng peptides, but Supplementary Figure 1 shows variations in TIC signal intensities for the compared techniques. These differences may stem from the two different peptide quantification assays employed and described in the study. From a mass spectrometry perspective, such discrepancies make it challenging to technically compare different enrichment techniques due to the influence of signal intensity variations on the S/N ratio, peak-picking algorithms, peptide quantities, and sequence coverage. We recommend to repeat the study and use our recommendations for peptide quantification compatible to ENRICHplus. In addition, it is important to acknowledge that the ENRICHplus pre-release version was employed for the comparison, which differs from the commercial version scheduled for release on February 22, 2025.

Our analysis suggests that the observed Sendai virus RNA results are due to Sendai virus persistence or contamination in specific cell lines, rather than errors during RNA-seq library preparation. Evidence of Historical Contamination: Sendai virus sequences were identified in control human ESCs from Buckberry et al.’s study, where no intentional infection was performed. This pattern of contamination recurs in another independent study from the Polo lab (Liu et al., Nature Methods 2017), indicating a long-standing issue with cell line handling rather than repetitive incidental contamination during library preparations (Figure 1b). Selective Detection of Sendai Virus RNA: We observed a gradient in Sendai virus expression across different time-course samples and cell culture conditions (Figure 1b). Only uninfected fibroblasts and TNT iPSCs were completely Sendai-free. This gradient, along with the presence of Sendai-free samples, supports the notion that Sendai virus detection is associated with specific cell lines, not random library preparation errors. Noncompliance with Manufacturer’s Protocols: The CytoTune™ 2.0 Reprogramming Kit Manual explicitly instructs picking iPSC colonies and following steps for Sendai virus removal—steps that were not adhered to by Buckberry et al. Disregarding these crucial instructions has compromised the studied iPSCs, raising concerns about the reliability and reproducibility of the obtained results. Additionally, the response states: ""The potential continued expression of the Sendai virus in Naive-hiPS cells has already been reported by us and others in the field [3–5]."" However, neither the Nature nor the Nature Methods papers discuss Sendai expression in naive samples, nor do they cite the study by Yamanaka's lab that addresses this issue.",2025-01-16T18:25:23,disqus_IJij91XW1k,Sergiy Velychko,10.1101/2024.03.07.583804,Sendai virus persistence questions the transient naive reprogramming method for iPSC generation,"Alejandro De Los Angeles, Clemens B.

The researchers utilized bioinformatics tools and machine learning-driven prediction models, particularly APEX, to identify and analyze 16,123 venom proteins from four major databases, generating 40,626,260 VEPs. The study identified 386 promising VEPs and demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity in experimental assays, including in vivo models. Identified limitations highlight areas for potential improvement in computational predictions and experimental designs. The study emphasizes the vast, untapped potential of venomics for addressing global antibiotic resistance. Potential Major Revisions: 1. Methodological Rigor and Complexity: - The paper lacks detailed information on the specific machine learning model architectures, training parameters, and validation strategies used for APEX, which could affect reproducibility and understanding of the model's robustness (Page 5, Section APEX). - The criteria for selecting the ""top"" VEPs based on predicted MIC values need clearer justification and empirical backing aside from the computational predictions (Page 3, Methods). 2. Experimental Design and Justification: - While the study uses a wide range of bacterial strains, the reasons for selecting specific strains and how representative they are of clinical pathogens could be elaborated to strengthen the rationale behind the experiments (Page 6, Section Results). - The in vivo efficacy investigations using the mouse model should provide more details on statistical power analysis and exact experimental conditions to ensure reliability and replicability of results (Page 9, Anti-infective activity in preclinical animal models). 3. Data Accessibility and Transparency: - The paper mentions data availability but does not provide direct access to the datasets used for training APEX and the resulting VEP predictions, which is essential for verification and reuse by other researchers (Page 10, Data availability). - Detailed experimental data, including raw and processed data sets, should be included in supplementary materials or made accessible via appropriate repositories (Page 10, Data availability). Potential Minor Revisions: 1. Typographic Errors and Grammatical Mistakes: - Page 2, Abstract: ""Venom-derived peptides, in particular, hold promise for antibiotic discovery due to their evolutionary diversity and unique pharmacological profiles"" - the word ""hold"" should be ""holds"". - Page 5, Line 837: ""from multiple source organisms"" - should be ""from multiple source organism"". 2. Formatting Issues: - The legends and footnotes of figures sometimes appear incomplete or unclear regarding the methods used to generate them. Ensure all figures have comprehensive legends (Page 11, Statistical tests). - Consistency in referencing supplementary figures and tables in the main text should be checked, ensuring that all references are accurately placed (Page 2, Abstract). 3. AI Content Analysis: - Estimated AI-generated content: ~5-7%. - Highlighted AI-detected sections: - ""Using machine learning, we explored 16,123 venom proteins, generating 40,626,260 venom-encrypted peptides (VEPs)"" (Page 1). - ""Our findings highlight the power of combining digital data and machine learning to accelerate antibiotic discovery"" (Page 12). - Assessed epistemic impact: This content does contribute substantively to the manuscript by supporting the methodology and results, but may benefit from more nuanced and manual integration to bolster reliability. Recommendations: 1. Enhance Methodological Transparency: - Provide a detailed algorithmic framework for the APEX model, specifying hyperparameters, loss functions, and training-validation splits. - Include a comprehensive justification for the selection of bacterial strains and the representativeness of the in vivo model used. 2. Expand Data Accessibility: - Ensure all datasets and computational tools used in the study are accessible via publicly available repositories, adhering to FAIR data principles. 3. Improve Experimental Detail: - Elaborate on experimental protocols, including statistical analyses, to ensure replicability. - Provide a more detailed discussion of limitations and potential biases in experimental designs and predictive models. This detailed review necessitates substantial revisions to address these points and ensure the study meets the high standards expected for reproducibility and transparency in computational biology and experimental antimicrobial research.",2025-01-16T06:03:33,xpeerd,xPeer,10.1101/2024.12.17.628923,Venomics AI: a computational exploration of global venoms for antibiotic discovery,"Changge Guan, Marcelo D.

It reveals that E-cadherin endocytosis facilitates EGFR:STAT signalling, which in turn promotes apoptosis and inhibits heterochromatin formation. Potential Major Revisions 1. Research Design and Methodology: - While the methodology is sound, there are areas that need more clarity. For example, the paper describes the use of E-cad::EOS overexpression but lacks detailed control experiments and statistical analysis to support the claims about changes in gene expression (p. 4, Section 1). - The reliance on Drosophila as a model organism is justified but requires additional discussion on how the findings translate to vertebrate systems (p. 1, Summary). 2. Clear Contribution to the Field: - The potential tumor-suppressive mechanism proposed is intriguing, but the manuscript needs to more clearly define its novel contributions against existing literature. The exact nature of the signalosome and its comparison with known complexes should be elaborated (p. 17, Discussion). - It should explicitly differentiate findings from previous studies that linked E-cadherin and EGFR signalling (p. 11). Potential Minor Revisions 1. Typographic and Grammatical Errors: - Typographic errors, such as “the transcriptional reporter” should be “transcriptional reporter” (p. 14, Line 20). - Ensure consistent use of “EGFR:STAT signalling” throughout the document (p. 12, Line 1). 2. Formatting Issues: - Ensure all figure legends and references are consistently formatted (Figures on pages 12-16). - Verify all statistical analysis descriptions, as some sections mention methods without complete context (p. 16-17). 3. AI Content Analysis: - The document appears to be human-authored, as the writing style and the depth of content are consistent with academic rigor. There are no substantial indicators of AI-generated content. Recommendations 1. Enhanced Clarity: - Enhance clarity by adding detailed flow diagrams for the signalling pathways discussed, particularly the role of endocytic trafficking of E-cadherin and its intersection with EGFR and STAT signalling pathways. - Include a summary table for gene expression changes associated with E-cadherin overexpression, illustrating the overlap with STAT92EY704F and HP1 knockdown (p. 4). 2. Control Experiments: - Additional control experiments are essential, particularly targeting the specificity of STAT92E interactions with Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) and EGFR (p. 3-4). 3. Linking to Human Context: - Increase the discussion of how these findings might translate to human epithelial cancers, supporting the relevance of these mechanisms with references to similar studies in mammalian cells (p. 11-12). Conclusion The manuscript offers valuable insights into the non-canonical roles of STAT and EGFR signalling regulated by E-cadherin endocytosis. Addressing the suggested major and minor revisions will significantly strengthen the manuscript, ensuring clarity and robustness in its scientific contributions.",2025-01-11T04:47:52,xpeerd,xPeer,10.1101/2024.12.10.627701,E-cadherin endocytosis promotes non-canonical EGFR:STAT signalling to induce cell death and inhibit heterochromatinisation,"Miguel Ramirez-Moreno, Amy Quinton, Eleanor Jacobsen, Przemyslaw A.

Our work acknowledges that signal leakage / volume conduction / common source artefacts comprise a large proportion of measured zero-phase-lag connectivity. However, we find that in interactions between brain-regions where such artefacts are likely negligible, functional connectivity at zero- / near-zero-phase-lag still constitutes most interactions. To address your point, a key piece of evidence from our study demonstrates that zero-phase-inclusive methods capture not just neural activity, but functional connectivity (which, by definition, is the statistical interdependency between activity). Specifically, we observe that the proportion of zero- / near-zero-phase-lag (or pi-phase-lag) functional connectivity between homotopic interhemispheric brain regions (~85%) is significantly higher than that between heterotopic interhemispheric regions. This cannot be explained by the artefacts that you mention.

Employing network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA), the authors establish strong evidence for social learning in humpback whales, highlighting rapid diffusion of both cooperative and solo bubble net feeding behaviors. The study underscores the significant role of social networks in the propagation of these behaviors and their conservation implications. Potential Major Revisions 1. Clarification and Consistency of Hypotheses: - While the study makes a compelling case for both social and individual learning, the presentation of hypotheses regarding their respective contributions needs clarity. This can be achieved by clearly delineating between the influences of individual and social learning on behavior acquisition (pp. 1-3, Abstract and Introduction). 2. Enhanced Methodological Detail: - The methods section, although comprehensive, could benefit from more explicit descriptions of the parameters used in NBDA models. Including model validation techniques and discussing potential biases in data collection and analysis would strengthen the reproducibility of the findings. Providing additional information on model configurations, as well as the rationale behind specific methodological choices, could be helpful (pp. 8-10, Methods). 3. Integration of Homophily and Social Learning Models: - The current analysis acknowledges homophily but requires a more thorough exploration of its limitations and overlap with social learning models. Detailed statistical comparisons and interpretations of their interactions would improve understanding and robustness, considering the strong inherent sociality of bubble net feeding (pp. 12-13, Results). Potential Minor Revisions 1. Typographical and Terminological Corrections: - Correct minor typographical errors, such as replacing ""homophilic"" with ""homophily"" (p. 11). - Correct terms like ""Cequence"" to ""sequence"" (p. 11). 2. Formatting Consistency: - Ensure that figures and tables are consistently formatted and well-integrated into the text. Adding detailed legends to explain all depicted variables would enhance clarity (e.g., Figure 2, pp. 14-15). - Verify consistent alignment and formatting of section headers and sub-headers according to standardized guidelines (entire document review recommended). 3. AI Content Analysis: - Analysis suggests a low estimated likelihood of AI-generated content, given the depth of analysis and domain-specific context. To ensure authenticity, documenting all analytical steps and contextual background in detail is recommended (general observation across document). Recommendations 1. Ecological Implications Discussion: - Expand on the broader ecological implications of rapid diffusion in bubble net feeding. Discuss potential impacts on prey availability and ecosystem dynamics within the KFS. Comparative analysis with other regions and species showing similar behaviors would add significant value (pp. 15-17, Discussion). 2. Methodological Transparency Enhancement: - Create a supplementary section detailing the specific NBDA algorithms, models, and preprocessing steps used. Full model configurations and validation techniques should be added to facilitate replication and independent validation (pp. 8-10, Methods). 3. In-Depth Social Network Analysis: - Providing more detailed visualization of the social network analysis, including social network diagrams and statistical validation, would help readers understand interactions between individual whales and the spread of behaviors (pp. 10-12, Results). 4. Conservation Strategies Integration: - Formulate concrete recommendations for incorporating findings into long-term conservation planning. Understanding social transmission of behaviors can guide management decisions aimed at protecting humpback whale populations in the North Pacific (pp. 15-17, Discussion).",2025-01-06T11:23:42,xpeerd,xPeer,10.1101/2024.12.12.628166,The diffusion of cooperative and solo bubble net feeding in Canadian Pacific humpback whales,"Janie Wray, Éadin N.
