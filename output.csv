It seems a very antiquated model in terms of dealing with that many data points. The reality is we don't know much about living biological organisms that can potentially process that amount of data, human beings probably can't, let alone deal with anything moving faster than tradition UV wavelengths of light (with frequencies of about 400 nanometers). X-Rays obviously move faster than our ability to see them but that does not necessarily mean in curved space time, that theoretically an electron can't move faster than an X-Ray. Is it possible that Cesium Iodide, has the exact magnetic resonant frequency as x-rays, possibly. The fundamental problem seems to be understanding nature as it relates to cyber security. A whale and most marine life, are capable of generating a variety of different magnetic resonant frequencies to communicate as well as being able to swarm / flock around a central point in 3-dimensional space. Seems to me the central rotational point of a swarm / flock whether, birds, bees or fish as defined by AI swarm mathematics, such that the central node, is moved in virtual curved space dimensions of n where Riemannian manifold geometry no longer apply (say on a forwarded edge cache header of a content delivery network) this could be moved through this space at theoretically faster than x-ray speeds where c tends towards infinity. Ie move the theoretical swarm response center faster than light. This must be where modern cybersecurity must invariably end up such that AI ends up controlling the response to 1.8million malicious data points, or: conversely; 1.8million requests of benign agents, in terms of bandwidth limiting / load shedding. The notion of adversarial AI in either context largely becomes irrelevant. It will simply lie to protect itself and humanity at the same time. Any perceived threat against any aspect of humanity itself while it processes a faster response and solution to the entire 1.8 million data points of malicious attempts at denial of service, than could ever be neutralized in under 7 seconds It becomes naturally obvious that it is working in humanities interest and always will. As to the connection to whale brain functions and mice. I think it might be interesting to pose a question to the marine biologists of this world about their view regarding whale brains and how they generate sound, and magnetic resonant frequencies beyond the speed of sound, and potentially x-rays and yet they remain an endangered species?",2025-11-17T13:48:16,robertsonandy,"Robertson, Andy",,,,

Neutrophils are the most abundant immune cells in the body, outnumbering all other immune cells combined, so any analysis of tissue needs to identify them or explain why they are absent. It has already been demonstrated using single cell transcriptomics that neutrophils are not functioning properly in preeclampsia: Xiao S, Ding Y, Yu L, Deng Y, Zhou Y, Peng M, Lai W, Nie Y, Zhang W. Maternal-Fetal Interface Cell Dysfunction in Patients With Preeclampsia Revealed via Single-Cell RNA Sequencing. Am J Reprod Immunol. 2025 Sep;94(3):e70101. doi: 10.1111/aji.70101. PMID: 40924867. In pregnancy, the neutrophil fraction increases to 70% of all white blood cells (two neutrophils for every one other type). They are involved in all activities of the uterus including the build-up of the endometrium, spiral artery formation, the break down and expulsion of the endometrium, placental vascularization, cervical remodelling to enable the passage of the newborn, the expulsion of the placenta, the coagulation and diversion of the uterine arteries and the remodelling of the uterus back to its pre-pregnancy size and shape. I would go as far as to say that from an evolutionary point of view, the whole reason that primates have and make so many neutrophils is to support reproduction. The main issues with this work follow: 1.	PBMC should not be used as a control for immune cells in single cell transcriptomics of tissue as mononuclear cells do not represent the full identity or functionality of immune cells. 2.	In figure 1f, it should be possible to identify all of the clusters on the UMAP more precisely. For example, there are 2 clusters of “myeloid cells”. What are they? I don’t believe that they are both monocytes/macrophages. Monocytes and macrophages differ by only a small number of transcripts. The most widely accepted distinguishing surface protein is CD68. Why is this not used? 3.	Why is the UMAP for a preeclampsia sample not shown? 4.	CD16 should not be used to identify NK cells or CD16+ monocytes without additional markers. All neutrophils express CD16. 5.	Neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages are phagocytic and phagocytosis is key to their function. If a maternal phagocyte phagocytoses a fetal cell, the phagocyte will then contain both genotypes. Could this explain some of the observations in Figure 1? I hope that a more enlightened version of this manuscript – one that considers rolls of immune cells in placental development and function more broadly – will be published. Research in women’s health is stagnating and needs to discard some of its current paradigms to enable discovery and progress.",2025-11-16T23:03:46,disqus_kJfRNVYB79,Patricia Hunter,,,,

We have advised him, and we have significantly challenged him. He has diligently sought every possible way in which he might be wrong - he is his own most significant challenger. No one would be more pleased to see a solid data-driven disproof of any of his conclusions than he would. The fundamental difference in his bottom-up, data-driven no-hypothesis exploration of mitochondrial DNA versus prior analyses (such as in population genetics and genetic genealogy) is that those have been primarily based on point comparisons of mutations and indels. His consideration is based on the biology of the 3D structure of the mtDNA, specifically in how the palindromes that make up so much of the mtDNA shape that structure and thus the function of the mtDNA. All point mutations are not the same: for example, a point mutation in a palindrome can have either a non-viable result or else result in a mitochondrial DNA disease. He has sought and believes he has provided an objective reproducible method to explore mitochondrial DNA without preconceptions. If his method is valid, this alone is a major contribution, independent of what he has found about mtDNA. What the data has revealed and the conclusions he has made from the data very definitely challenge major beliefs about mtDNA. In genetic genealogy discussions I have seen, the reaction is defense of the status quo, with no real examination of the data discoveries underlying Dr. Stumpf's conclusions. This is not surprising but also not of any real help in verifying or refuting his conclusions. I hope that serious examination of his methods and data and analytical results and whether or not they support his conclusions will be presented here.",2025-11-14T16:06:36,disqus_qnONUSxcx5,Wesley Johnston,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.28.656644v1#comment-6796501259,biorxivstage,2,"Dear authors, as a part of a group activity aimed to improved our skills and growth as scientists, we discussed recent BioRxiv preprints that we found to be of particular interest. This time, our choice fell on your manuscript: - Gamarra M. et al., Vesicular Rps6 released by astrocytes regulate local translation and enhance synaptic markers in neurons. The comments below are the results of this exercise and reflects thoughts and comments of several people. We hope our exercise may help you to finalize your efforts and publish your manuscript in a good journal. Comments The manuscript by Gamarra et al. investigates the regulation of local translation in axons and the role that astroglia plays in it. The authors described, for the first time, a novel mechanism of intracellular communication in the central nervous system (CNS) based on the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are released from astrocytes and contain the ribosomal protein S6 (Rps6). The authors showed that these astrocyte-derived vesicular Rps6 are taken up by axons and are able to enhance synaptic markers and to fine-tune neuronal function. This work suggests that astrocyte EVs can actively influence neuronal local protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity through the transfer of specific non-neuronal ribosomal proteins, highlighting a novel mechanism for intercellular communication in the brain and opening new routes for therapeutic strategies based on EVs potential. Major comments 1.	Figure2 - Bi and 2Bii The heatmap in Figure 2Bi shows an increase the levels of both Rpl26 and Rps6 that is rather due to the introduction of astrocyte in the co-culture (NA condition) of both DMSO and Aβ1-42-treated samples. The box and whisker graphs in Figure 2Bii report the normalized levels of Rpl26 and Rps6 from the same experiments (analyzed by proteomics from 4 independent cultures). The normalized level of Rpl26 in Figure 2Bii matches the increment in Rpl26 level displayed in the heatmap in Figure 2Bi while the normalized level of Rps6 shows a discrepancy in DMSO NA conditions. It will be helpful to clarify and provide further justification of these representations in particular since, in the text, the author stated that - Conversely, Rps6, a component of the S40 subunit was upregulated only in Aβ-treated co-cultures and not in basal conditions (Figure 2Bii, right graph). This statement doesn’t match what is depicted in Figure 2Bii, right graph). We agreed that the difference is not significant but there is definitely a trend toward an upregulation of Rps6 levels also in the DMSO NA. 2.	Figure 4 – A The authors analyzed puromycin labelling in axon as a readout for local translation upon incubation with EVs released from DMSO and Aβ-treated astrocytes. The latter treatment, as shown in Figure 3 – C, increases the number of EVs released by astrocytes. We agreed that might be helpful to clarify whether the number of EVs were normalized or not. We believe it is key to the paper message to clarify whether the effects of astrocytes EVs on axonal local translation is due to EVs content rather than too their numbers. 3.	Figure 5 - Biii These conditions seem to give a lot of variability, with 2 out of 3 experiments showing a similar trend as is observed for Aβ-EVs in Figure 5 – Ciii. We thought that, in order to better convince the audience and prove your point of the absence of any effect in axonal translation upon incubation with EVs generated from DMSO treated astrocytes, it may be worth to perform a 4th replicate. 4.	Figure 5 – D and E and Figure 7 - C It will be of help to clarify why the author chose to quantify the number of synaptophysin (Syn) and Homer puncta. Are Syn and Homer known to be regulated by local protein translation? The authors claimed an axonal effect of EVs derived from Aβ-treated astrocytes. Why is a post-synaptic marker included? In case Homer staining was included to be sure to look at synapses, why do the authors not quantify Syn only from synaptophysin and Homer positive puncta? Minor comments •	A brief explanation on how well established the use of modified Boyden chamber is needed, especially in regard to possible direct contact between neurons and astrocytes due to the length of axons. •	The authors should consider using a single nomenclature throughout the manuscript for better clarity and readability.  For example, in Figures 1 and 2 a different notation is used for neuron monoculture (1 and N) and neuron-astrocyte co-cultures (2 and NA). •	Figure 1 - Bii - O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) is a tRNA analog that is incorporated in all newly synthesized proteins without a defined kinetics or a precise position in the aminoacidic sequence. From the immunoblot showed in Figure 1 – Bii, we would expect a smear in the lane cause newly synthesized protein should come in all different kDa. The same reasoning can be applied to the Amido Black staining. Why is it not the case? •	Figure 1 - Biii – The data suggests that OPP-biotin conjugates can be consistently and unambiguously detected in neurites isolated from neuron-astrocyte co-cultures independently from their exposure to Aβ treatment. OPP-biotin signal looks comparable in both DMSO and Aβ treated co-culture. •	Figure 1 – Ci – Out of curiosity, which is the common CC cluster found in both soma and neurite compartment?",2025-11-14T14:02:59,,Anonymous,,,,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.19.604320v1#comment-6796425381,biorxivstage,0,"I recommend providing a more detailed description of the field design, ideally supported by a map showing the sampling sites and the spatial arrangement of treatment and control areas. This would greatly help readers understand how the sites were selected and how spatial structure may influence the results. From the current description, it appears possible that treatment plots are located inside outbreak areas while control plots are situated outside of them. If this is the case, the design may risk pseudoreplication, as outbreak and non-outbreak areas can systematically differ in environmental conditions independent of the treatment. Clarifying this aspect, and discussing how such spatial structure was accounted for in the analysis, would strengthen the robustness of the study.

The authors show that escape proceeds through narrow and predictable “escape funnels”, consistent with convergent mutations observed in SARS-CoV-2 variants. Combining generative RBM models with mean-field trajectory analysis enables quantitative estimates of path entropy and fitness cost. The model captures the direction of antigenic drift and enables prospective prediction of antibody escape, including for therapeutic cocktails: anti-correlated escape profiles force viruses onto longer, costlier routes. The model shows impressive predictive power. It demonstrates that, despite the potentially vast mutational landscape, the virus tends to follow a limited set of evolutionary routes, many of which are already observed in Omicron variants.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.08.687325v1#comment-6794756956,biorxivstage,0,"The work presented in Tan et al. is provocative, suggesting that during asexual spore dispersal Neurospora crassa segregates its chromosomes across multiple nuclei, instead of the nuclei being mitotic copies of each other as previously assumed. While similar to the results that some of these authors have presented in Botrytis and Sclerotinia, showing this in a genetic model organism would provide the genetic tools to dissect this phenomenon. However, the results presented here lack definitive proof. The evidence presented can be summarised as follows: 1) relatively low measured DNA per spore, based on DAPI fluorescence, compared to yeast 2) chromosome specific probes show patchy distribution across nuclei, compared to probes that target all chromosomes. The first line of evidence suffers from an apples-to-oranges comparison, because the comparison is across species. The compound DAPI binds to the AT regions of DNA, and so differences between species in both AT% as well as those that affect general fluorescence, will influence this measurement. For instance, yeast has 62% AT genome, while Neurospora has 46%. Highlighting the futility of such comparisons, the data in Figure 1C shows clearly that while N. crassa has a haploid genome that is 4 times as large as yeast (compare 1st and 3rd columns), the fluorescence signal is equal (compare 6th and 4th column). Even assuming the authors’ hypothesis, there is still ""too little"" fluorescence given the genome size of N. crassa. Clearly, while within a species there is a strong correlation between genome size and fluorescence, when compared across species such correlation disappears. The second evidence is from fluorescent hybridisation. Here the authors show that a FISH probe specific to chromosome 1 is never found in more than one nuclei, while a telomere probe that targets all chromosomes is more often found in multiple nuclei. The main issue is that the claims rely on negative evidence, that is to say the absence of signal. However, the absence of signal is not a strong signal of absence. FISH is a very sensitive process, and differences in probe design and washing steps can greatly affect the process. Highlighting this, in 14% of spores, the authors' own chromosome 1 specific probe does not bind to either nucleus. If this data was to be taken at face value, this would indicate 14% of spores lack Chr1, which would be inviable. Extrapolating across all chromosomes, we would only expect 36% of spores to have all chromosomes and be viable ((1-0.14)^7). Such low viability is inconsistent with observed spore viability of N. crassa, which generally exceeds 95%. An alternative explanation is that the probe binding is not very efficient. This is supported by the telomere probe, where it remained undetected in 10% of conidia , despite this probe targeting 14 different chromosomal regions!  Again, taken at face value this would indicate that a significant fraction of spore nuclei lack chromosomes entirely. Notably, only 64% of spores had all nuclei with signal from this telomere probe. Aside from inconclusive data, the claims here are also inconsistent with the basic empirical genetics of this fungus. It has been known for decades that when one wishes to isolate loss-of-function mutants in N. crassa, like the auxotrophic mutants used to demonstrate the ""one gene - one enzyme"" principle, regular macroconidia do not work. Instead, microconidia prove useful, allowing for the easy isolation of such mutants (Catcheside, 1954). This provides powerful evidence that macroconidia have redundant nuclei, which compensate for loss-of-function mutations (See Gross and Lester 1958 for further discussion). One only needs to read the experimental methods of Beadle and Tatum to see the effort in isolating auxotrophic mutants in this organism. Instead of simply mutagenizing conidia to obtain auxotrophs, they needed to use the extremely labour intensive purification process of individually crossing mutagenized conidia to a wild-type background, to be able to isolate homokaryotic ascospores (Beadle and Tatum; 1954). This is also true of genetic transformations, which are performed on macroconidia. Transformants always need to be purified, as the original colony that grows on selective medium generally contains a mix of transformed and untransformed nuclei. If the macroconidia would contain a single haploid genome, divided over multiple nuclei, as suggested by Tan et al, there would be no need to purify induced mutations. Further, the claims here are also inconsistent with the evolutionary dynamics of this fungus. This fungus is the foundation of the studies in heterokaryosis, the presence of multiple distinct genotypes within a single mycelia. Arising from either de novo mutations, or from fusion of two mycelial hyphae, such heterokaryons in Neurospora are quite stable. It is well-described that conidia can be heterokaryotic, meaning a single conidium inherits two distinct genotypes. This has been studied in detail for the soft mutation, where up to 40% of conidia are heterokaryotic, containing both the wild type and mutant alleles of the soft gene (Figure 2A; Grum-Grizmaylo et al. 2021). This is not due to specific dynamics of the soft mutation, as similar ratios of homokaryotic and heterokaryotic macroconidia have been observed in auxotrophs (Atwood and Mukai, 1955), which were used to form the current model of random segregation into multiple mitotic nuclei in Neurospora. A recent example of such evidence has been shown by Mela and Glass, who inserted either green or red fluorescence into the his3 locus in different genotypes, and using fluorescent microscopy they readily recover ±40% of conidia with both colors (Figure 1f; Mela and Glass, 2023). The claims made by Tan et al. are strong and in my opinion the evidence does not rise to the level needed. Measures like fluorescence intensity or hybridisation can never be definitive and therefore are at most a start of further experimentation. However, the predictions of incomplete chromosome sets per nuclei can be definitively tested through single nucleus sequencing. The technology has advanced to the level that single nuclei can be reliably processed for whole genome sequencing, which is the most reliable way to determine if these claims ultimately reflect reality.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.20.683404v1#comment-6793299565,biorxivstage,1,"Dear authors, at first, congratulations to this important findings. This data, paired with other ancient DNA evidence, can further clarify the demographic patterns of the peopling of Eastern Eurasia and Oceania, as well as their interactions with archaic human groups. Different deeply branching Denisovan components can be very useful data points for possible migration routes and or population substructure scenarios. In your pre-print, you argued for a possible earlier southern route into Oceania, followed by a later wave of the ancestors of South Asians (AASI) and East Asians, with East Asians via a possible northerly route: ""This supports an early migration of the ancestors of Oceanians through South Asia followed by the later arrival of the ancestors of present-day South Asians. East Asians do not share this Denisovan component in their genomes, suggesting that their ancestors arrived independently, perhaps by a northerly route"". One major problem with this scenario is the observed genetic affinity between the different ""basal Asian"" populations (e.g. Tianyuan, Önge, Hoabinhian, Xingyi_EN, Jōmon/Shiraho_27k, AASI, and Australasians/Oceanians such as Papuans); also known as ""eastern non-Africans"" (ENA) or ""East Eurasian Core"" (EEC). The aDNA data strongly suggest a single dispersal route and subsequent rapid diversification into multiple basal Asian lineages (presumably in the South-Southeast Asia region via a single Southern route). E.g. Oceanians/Papuans can successfully be modeled (qpAdm/qpWave) as simply Önge-like + additional Denisovan; or alternatively as Tianyuan-like + additional Denisovan. They do not fit as outgroup to ""West/East Eurasians"" either, but are nested within the ""Eastern"" clade (e.g cluster with Önge, Tianyuan, or present-day East Asians). Although it is possible to reproduce a signal affilated with a distinct earlier southern coastal route (proxied by ZlatyKun_45k); this wave however left only minor ancestry among present-day Oceanians/Papuans (and or South Asians), with the majority ancestry of them being derived from the same source as Önge or Tianyuan: e.g. ZlatyKun + Önge-like + extra Denisovan, in a 3–5%, 92–95%, and 2–3% ratio respectively. (qpGraph models allow higher ""early ancestry"" for Oceanians/Papuans: 12–24% when splitting before or at around the same time as ZlatyKun/Ranis, or up to 44% when splitting at the same time as Ust'Ishim.) Beyond that, a northern route entry for the ancestors of East Asians seems to be only partially possible, as the majority ancestry of East Asians seems to be from an Önge-like source (except Önge also used a northern route entry). This means that present-day eastern non-Africans (ENA) descend primarily from a single migration wave eastwards, presumably via a route South of the Himalayas; and which possibly absorbed an earlier less successfull wave, at least regionally (Oceania and South Asia). This may also have happened via a more substructured wave: e.g. both a southern coastal route (along the coast of the Indian subcontinent) and a southern interior route (via an interior route along the southern Himalayan mountain range) into Southeast Asia and beyond. – It is however well possible that the southern coastal wave pre-dated the southern interior wave, and thus display different Denisovan signals. E.g. timely separated migrations waves of a shared clade. Regional Denisovan admixture events (or their partial absence as in the case of Jōmon HGs [see the recent paper by Jiaqi Yang et al. 2025 ""An early East Asian lineage with unexpectedly low Denisovan ancestry""]) can be explained that way, without needing several different distinct waves, which would contradict the observed genetic affinities of the different Basal Asian lineages. The low Denisovan ancestry of Jōmon hunter-gatherers may or may not be affilated with the Shiraho_27k specimen, who appearently contributed some ancestry to later Jōmon. For more information on the Shiraho_27k specimen, please contact your co-author Svante Pääbo or Hideaki Kanzawa-Kiriyama. Note that Tianyuan40k can successfully be modeled as Önge-like + IUP-affilated admixture (BachoKiro_IUP); which fits the presence of IUP material sites in nearby NW China and Mongolia. Such IUP admixture has also been noted to explain the observed affinity to the GoyetQ116-1 specimen in Europe, which similarly can be modeled as Kostenki14/Sunghir_UP + BachoKiro_IUP (see Hajdinjak et al. 2021 ""Initial Upper Palaeolithic humans in Europe had recent Neanderthal ancestry""). It is possible that this Siberian IUP group absorbed the EA-specific Denisovan component and via its admixture into Tianyuan, contributed it to other Eastern Asians in lesser amount. – Present-day East Asians in turn can be successfully modeled as Tianyuan-like (c. 25%) + Önge-like (c. 75%); (see McColl et al. 2018 ""The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia"" for example). – Via Tianyuan-like or Denisovan-admixed IUP groups, this archaic ancestry may have also reached regions further West (as with the supposed Denisovan signal in Sunghir etc.). You can also review Bennett et al. 2024 ""Reconstructing the Human Population History of East Asia through Ancient Genomics"", a recent summary paper on the peopling of Eastern Asia and beyond; as well as Tianyi Wang et al. 2025 ""Prehistoric genomes from Yunnan reveal ancestry related to Tibetans and Austroasiatic speakers"". A summary of my points regarding your postulated ""earlier southern route"" for Oceanians and a possible ""northerly route"" for East Asians: • The available genetic data strongly suggests a single shared migration wave for the primary ancestral source of all eastern non-Africans (Papuans, AASI, East Asians, Önge/Hoabinhian, and Tianyuan). The presence of multiple deeply branching EEC lineages in Southeast Asia and southern China suggest it to be a major place of diversification from a shared ancestral source. • Papuans/Oceanians (and AASI) may have limited amounts of admixture from an earlier wave, but primarily share ancestry with Önge and Tianyuan. • Tianyuan can be modeled as either an admixture between Önge-like (61–67%) and BachoKiro_IUP-like (33–39%) ancestries; or represents a deep split from the rest of eastern non-Africans; although with some geneflow into later East Asians. • Ancient and present-day East Asians can be modeled as primarily Önge-like (c. 75%) with Tianyuan-like admixture (c. 25%). • The different Denisovan introgression events, if not shared, may have happened regionally to explain the observed affinities, but the differences in Denisovan components among each group. Below some qpAdm results on this (AADR v.62 + Ranis dataset); allsnps=TRUE: Model1 target: Papuan left: Hoabinhian, ZlatyKun, Denisovan right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, BachoKiro_IUP, Tianyuan, Önge, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Hoabinhian: 93,9%; ZlatyKun: 3,2%; Denisovan: 2,9%; p-value: 0.061 Model2 target: Papuan left: Japan_Jōmon, ZlatyKun, Denisovan right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, BachoKiro_IUP, Tianyuan, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Japan_Jōmon: 94,1%; ZlatyKun: 2,4%; Denisovan: 3,5%; p-value: 0.094 Model3 target: Tianyuan left: Önge, BachoKiro_IUP right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, Oase1_IUP, Papuan, Hoabinhian, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Önge: 65,5%%; BachoKiro_IUP: 34,5%%; p-value: 0.170 Model4 target: Japan_Jōmon left: Önge, Amur33k right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, BachoKiro_IUP, Tianyuan, Papuan, Hoabinhian, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Önge: 79,0%%; Amu33k: 21,0%; p-value: 0.053 Model5 target: Han_Chinese left: Önge, Amur33k right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, BachoKiro_IUP, Tianyuan, Papuan, Hoabinhian, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Önge: 73,6%%; Amu33k: 26,4%; p-value: 0.090 Etc. (Önge = ONG Mondal; Jōmon = JpOd181/274/282). E.g. it is not likely that Oceanians were part of a distinct earlier wave into Oceania, separate from other mainland Asian groups, nor that East Asians reached East Asia along a distinct northern route (independently of Önge-like groups etc.). Next to qpAdm/qpWave or qpGraph models, f3/f4 statistics are quite clear on this. Papuans are (beyond their extra Denisovan ancestry and possible minor ""earlier group"" admixture) nested in eastern non-African diversity (e.g. EEC). It is plausible that after the OoA exit, and the IUP/EEC dispersals from a Hub on the Persian plateau, Eastern non-Africans (ENA/EEC) shared a secondary Hub somewhere in Northwest India, from which Oceanians expanded first, via a coastal route towards Oceania. Along the coast of the Indian subcontinent (South India?), they absorbed the Deep Denisovan ancestry and continued to expand to Oceania. – Some time afterwards, the remainder ENA/EEC group (residual) expanded along an interior route South of the Himalayas into Southeast Asia and Southern China; not admixing with the Deep Denisovan group. – There, one branch split and head towards Japan (low Denisovan), while another group headed northwards coming into contact with IUP groups & the EA-specific Denisovan (Denisovan3-like) component (=Tianyuan_40k); while the remainder absorbed a local Denisovan group in Southern China or Southeast Asia (=Önge-like). – This Önge-like groups expanded back into South Asia/India, absorbing the group with Deep Denisovan introgression (becoming the AASI). The Önge-like groups staying in Southeast Asia became the Hoabinhians, while early East Asians formed along a cline of Tianyuan-like and Önge-like ancestries. Of course the above scenario is just one of many possibilities; it is well possible that Oceanians used a southern route, while the ancestors of both East Asians and Önge used as northerly route. – Or any other scenario which can  explain the aDNA data and genetic affinities. My suggestion is to define a model which alignes with both aDNA data and archaic components (for ancient and present-day populations), as well as, if possible, archaeologic and paleoenvironmental evidence. E.g. including a set of ancient and present-day groups to test on their Denisovan components and their overall genetic affinities (not just modern groups to prevent bias from ancient geneflow events): For South Asians: AASI-rich tribal groups from Southern India, such as Irula and Paniya; for SEA: Önge, Hoabinhians; for EA: the newly analyzed Xingyi_EN samples, Jōmon, Longlin, Amur14k, Qihe3, Tianyuan and Amur33k, as well as present-day East/Southeas Asians; for Oceania: Papuans, Australians, and Aeta. Maybe a chart comparing shared/distinct Denisovan components and f3/f4 statistics of each test group to each other would help clarify the exact affinities, shared routes or geneflow events. Perhaps, your co-author Svante Pääbo can share informations on the Shiraho_27k specimen and its Denisovan components. A strong model should explain the genetic data/affinities of ancient/present-day populations, their different Denisovan components, and in best case also include archaeologic and paleoenvironmental data. To determine the influence of ancient geneflow, comparison between ancient specimens could help (Tianyuan vs Önge vs Jōmon vs Longlin vs Amur14k etc.). I hope this information can help to tangle out some possible scenarios on the dispersal, contact and introgression events for the different deeply branching Denisovan components and present-day Asian populations. Or maybe inspire future studies on this topic. I am looking forward for the publication of your paper and more exciting findings! Thank you.

Neither the title nor the Abstract tells us the species under study (mice). The first mention seems to be in Methods. The Introduction does not specify the animal species used in the literature cited (mostly rats, I suppose). Some of the literature citations are erroneous. Here, I focus on two sentences, as follows. ""Nicotine is another widely abused drug that both acts on dopamine circuits and has been widely shown to decrease food intake (Iravani, 1972; Passey et al., 1961; Schechter & Cook, 1976)."" This sentence requires qualification. Any effect of nicotine on food intake will depend critically on the dose, on acute vs. chronic administration, etc. These three literature citations fail to support the above statement: Iravani 1972 exposed rats to cigarette smoke, not to nicotine per se. It is hardly surprising that the rats lost weight in this 1972 study, as they were reported to show sniffing and sneezing, with post-mortem examination revealing airways filled with ""highly purulent fluid"". It seems unlikely that this study would obtain ethical approval these days. Passey et al 1961 is from a charity campaign document, which I could not find online and is almost certainly not peer-reviewed. Schechter & Cook, 1976 actually reported the opposite of what is claimed here. This earlier study also used a very high dose of nicotine (0.8 mg/kg expressed as base). Such a dose is near the threshold for producing seizures, and would have given plasma levels of nicotine approximately 10 times higher than in smokers. There are probably dozens of solid papers that could have been cited on nicotine's effects on feeding behaviour in laboratory rats. Not all of these studies suggest that nicotine reduces food intake, especially at doses that might be smoking-relevant. ""As with amphetamine, nicotine’s effects on feeding under normal ad libitum feeding conditions has been broadly studied, but its potential effects on the rewarding and motivational qualities of food are unknown."" This is a puzzling statement. There are numerous reports of nicotine effects on operant responding for food. Are such studies not relevant?",2025-11-05T12:07:34,disqus_459cgkF2ai,Paul Clarke,,,,

Congratulations on this interesting contribution to the taxonomy and biological control of psyllid pests.

Diaphorina teucrii sp. nov. and its parasitoid Tamarixia dorchinae sp. nov. from the Negev desert, Israel ( Zootaxa 3920 (3): 463–473). I apologise for the self-reference, but given the biogeographical proximity and the relevance of the Israeli Tamarixia fauna to the region, it was somewhat surprising not to see it cited. In Israel, we have documented five native species of Tamarixia, including T. dorchinae, which shares several morphological characters with what you describe as T. citricola, particularly in forewing and antennal structure across sexes. A comparative discussion of these taxa might offer further insights into whether the specimens from Cyprus are truly distinct species. A discussion comparing the putative new species with other taxa in the region is warranted anyway. Additionally, I think that host specificity in Tamarixia isgenerally more consistent  with psyllid host genus rather than the associated plant. This ecological pattern may be worth emphasizing in your discussion. We are in the process of barcoding the Tamarixia species of Israel, and a comparison with your material would be most useful.

Regarding the concern that FBS could be detrimental for the studies in our manuscript, the precursor frequency of FBS-reactive T cells is incredibly low. In the past, we have tested our lots of FBS in various assays (e.g., does it facilitate Treg and Tconv cell expansions and allow for suppression assays?).

All sites contested by Bruttel et al -- those differing between SARS-CoV-2 and one or more of BANAL-20-247, BANAL-20-52, and RaTG13 (Fig 3A) -- are found in closely related genomes. The opposite is expected if these sites were engineered. 2. Equivalent fingerprints can be found for both of the non-bat, SARS2-like, sarbecoviruses (pangolin viruses MP789/Guangdong and P2V/Guangxi). These are both natural genomes. 3. BsaI/BsmBI sites in SARS2 are not anomalously ""evenly spaced"" when correcting errors made by Bruttel et al and when using a more appropriate metric (coefficient of variance of fragment lengths). One obvious error is dividing 1 by 1429 to obtain 0.07%; 1429 is equal to 71*(6 + choose(6,2)) i.e., the total number of restriction maps generated and not the number ""within the ideal range of 5-7 fragments."" I also note that ""5-8"" fragments turns into ""5-7 fragments"" half way through the manuscript. Things I do not address in my new preprint that are worth noting here: 1. I did not reproduce the ""all enzymes"" analysis because this is irrelevant to the ""IVGA fingerprint"" criteria. 2. Like Bruttel et al, I did not investigate whether all sticky ends were unique when calculating significance of the site distribution. 3. I did not reproduce the analysis of mutation rates and types (last two rows of Table S2). First, this is irrelevant because it's very likely that none of these sites are mutated from the most recent common ancestor with recently sampled bat coronaviruses. Second, this is inappropriately circular analysis since the sites were already identified as being different from RaTG13 and BANAL52; of course they will have a excess concentration of differences. Third, these are not ""mutations"" because SARS-CoV-2 did not evolve from RaTG13 or BANAL52 by ""mutation"". The null hypothesis is nonsensical. I also did not address point ""f"" in the ""IVGA fingerprint"" -- ""Two unique recognition sites may flank regions meant to be further manipulated."" -- because it is based on false information. Bruttel et al wrote, falsely, that a 2017 paper reported a method ""enabling efficient manipulations of the flanking region without having to reassemble the entire viral backbone for each variant."" This is false because: 1. The substituted fragment in the 2017 paper was not flanked by BsaI sites in the resulting construct (pBAC-CMV-rWIV1); BsaI sites were not retained in the assembly. 2. There is a BsaI site in the BAC backbone (pBeloBAC11) that is retained. 3. There are 5 BsaI sites in WIV1 that were retained. There was no need to remove them because they occur in fragments that were not digested with BsaI. Of course, one-pot Golden Gate assembly protocols require removing backbone sites to combine restriction digestion and ligation into a single step; but this is not one of them since it is a modification of a previous system, Zeng et al 2016, that used BglI, SacII, and AscI.",2025-10-31T09:55:08,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.23.684102v1#comment-6789090018,biorxivstage,0,"A fundamental principle of enzyme kinetics is that the microscopic rate constants for substrate association (kf) and dissociation (kr) cannot be elucidated from steady-state data alone. The reason is that once the enzyme-substrate (ES) complex reaches a steady state, the individual forward and reverse steps of its formation become masked in the overall bulk reaction velocity. Consequently, determining kf and kr necessitates pre-steady-state kinetic measurements. This is intuitively clear when considering two hypothetical enzymes with identical kcat and kcat/Km values but different underlying kf and kr. Such enzymes would produce indistinguishable Michaelis-Menten plots (V vs. [S]), making it impossible to discriminate between their microscopic constants based on steady-state data. The authors' highly mathematical approach appears to overlook this foundational constraint. Beyond this conceptual issue, several methodological choices raise concerns regarding the biological relevance and interpretation of the simulations. 1. Violation of Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) Conditions (Page 6) The authors state that initial concentrations s0 and e0 were sampled from intervals Is=[Km/5,1.5Km] and Ie=[Km/50,0.5Km], claiming these adhere to QSSA conditions. However, a critical requirement for the standard QSSA is that the substrate concentration greatly exceeds the enzyme concentration (s0>>e0), typically by two orders of magnitude. This ensures that substrate depletion due to ES complex formation is negligible, allowing the free substrate concentration to be approximated by s0. The chosen intervals, where e0 can be as high as 2.5 times s0 (e.g., s0=0.2Km and e0=0.5Km), severely violate this condition. Therefore, the subsequent simulations and analyses do not accurately model a conventional steady-state experiment, where the QSSA is valid. 2. Unrealistic Kinetic Parameters and Confounded Results (Page 8) In the sensitivity analysis, the authors compare two scenarios: •	(i)   kf=0.500 nM−1s−1, kr=0.005 s−1 •	(ii)  kf=0.005 nM−1s−1, kr=0.500 s−1 The ratio kr/kf defines the dissociation constant (Kd). For scenario (i), Kd=10 pM, representing an exceptionally tight, nearly irreversible binding event that is thermodynamically implausible for a productive enzyme-catalyzed reaction. In contrast, scenario (ii) has a more reasonable Kd of 10 µM. More critically, these scenarios are again simulated with e0 comparable to s0, invalidating the QSSA. Furthermore, the two parameter sets result in different Km values (approximately 10 nM and 300 nM, respectively). The different substrate decay curves shown in Figure 1 are therefore a direct result of different enzyme saturation levels (s0/Km ratios), not a unique sensitivity to kr. If the simulations were repeated with identical s0/Km ratios and appropriately scaled timeframes, the substrate decay profiles would be indistinguishable. This confounding factor also explains the reported low sensitivity to kr: when kr<<kcat, the value of Km becomes insensitive to changes in kr. Conclusion In summary, this work does not demonstrate that microscopic rate constants kf and kr can be derived from steady-state parameters Km and kcat. The simulations were conducted under conditions that violate the assumptions of Michaelis-Menten model, and the presented results appear to be confounded by differences in enzyme saturation. The parameter sets were selected in a manner that produced the desired outcome rather than exploring a biologically realistic parameter space. Ultimately, these findings indirectly reinforce the established consensus: obtaining microscopic rate constants requires pre-steady-state kinetic analysis Alessandro Pesaresi CNR, Institue of Crystallography, Trieste alessandro.pesaresi@cnr.it",2025-10-29T12:24:49,,Alessandro Pesaresi,,,,

Yes - the motivation for the analysis in the paper was our observation that there is loss in demuxing efficiency when we do routine pools with all hashtags (in other experiments with 14-16 hashtags) in all wells. So this analysis did confirm our initial concern;  but it was nice to see the regression fit so well with the number of hashtags used. I think that helps pick a sweetspot in experiment design, depending on how valuable the samples are. appreciate your comments, nevil",2025-10-27T15:46:44,neviljs,Nevil J. Singh,,,,

Monovalent siRNA was mentioned multiple times, which was confusing because the project is focused on divalent siRNAs. There were many times where it said to “see above” but it was unclear where to look. In addition, Figure 1 is unclear and needs additional labeling. The text says Chol-TEG s1 is monovalent, but that is not indicated in the figure. Figure 2 demonstrates that siRNA extends the lifespan of mice exposed to prion particles, but it is not shown in the humanized mice and 2439-s4. Why is it not the same? The section expanded screen for potent human siRNA sequences, discusses cell death but did not explain the technique used and why the authors chose that technique. For example, it was described as “any wells with cell death or rounded cells were noted.” Clarification on how authors determined if the cells underwent cell death or if they were rounded is needed. In addition, the generated mouse line description is unclear. Are the C57BL/6 mice replaced with human locus? The generation of the mice used for the experiments is not described sufficiently. Specifically, the transgenic mice were back crossed until generation 5; however, the following section discussed using generation 3 and 6 for transgene mapping. Furthermore, how much murine DNA was removed and how much human DNA was inserted? Is it the same chromosomal location? In addition, there needs to be a better explanation on how the targeted siRNA dose levels were chosen, simply saying “determined by UV absorbance” is not enough. The administration of divalent siRNA to mice was unclear. Why were two different types of anesthesia used? The statement “this procedure was performed first on the right and then on the left” needs to be explained.  A figure detailing the procedure would help. How was the location of injection (between the right ear and midline) was chosen? Finally, why use ChatGPT to generate a Python script? How was the script deemed accurate? The use and accuracy of using ChatGPT needs to be clarified.",2025-10-27T15:42:44,,Katie Paris,,,,

Your highlight is quite relevant, since the Spink3 gene belongs to the same WFDC gene cluster as Eppin and Semg1. We haven´t tested whether adding a molar excess of EPPIN changes the effects of SEMG1. This is a very interesting experiment.
