However, the primary use case for this will be remote servers. People just don't have the laptops required to run the cellranger software. Even if they did, once you throw docker into the mix, you ask the experimentalist end user to know quite a bit about the command line. If they know enough to use docker, they would probably be able to use a lot of the command line apps available for this. With that in mind, I'd like to see way more documentation on the remote setup. Especially the incorporation of the ShinyProxy. I want to use this for folks on my team but I'm not especially clear on how this app works with the proxy. My other concern is the closed source code baked into the docker image. I'd encourage you to release it. Also, the youtube documentation while great, also should  be posted as static documentation.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.500229v1#comment-6006954805,biorxivstage,0,"This paper aims to understand how toxin-antidote (TA) elements are spread and maintained in species, especially in species where outcrossing is infrequent and the selfish gene drive of TA elements is limited. The paper focuses on the possible fitness costs and benefits of the peel-1/zeel-1 element in the nematode C. elegans. A combination of mathematical modeling and experimental tests of fitness are presented. The authors make a surprising finding: the toxin gene peel-1 provides a fitness advantage to the host. This is a very interesting finding that challenges how we think about selfish genetic elements, demonstrating that they may not be wholly “selfish” in order to spread in a population. This paper is of interest to evolutionary biologists and population geneticists. It provides empirical evidence that supports a previous hypothesis of how selfish toxin-antidote elements spread in non-obligate outcrossing species. While the experiments and data are appropriate for addressing this hypothesis, one major conclusion is not supported by the data and one other major conclusion is supported only weakly. Strengths 1. The authors support results found with a zeel-1 peel-1 introgressed strain by using CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to precisely knock-out the genes of interest. They were careful to ensure the loss-of-function of these generated alleles by using genetic crosses. 2. Similarly, the authors are careful with controls, ensuring that genetic markers used in the fitness assays did not affect the fitness of the strain. This ensures that the genes of interest are causative for any source of fitness differences between strains, therefore making the data reliable and easily interpretable. 3. A powerful assay for directly measuring the relative fitness of two strains is used. 4. The authors support relative fitness data with direct measurements of fitness proximal traits such as body size (a proxy for growth rate) and fecundity, providing further support for the conclusion that peel-1 increases fitness. Weaknesses 1. One major conclusion is that peel-1 increases fitness independent of zeel-1, but this claim is not well supported by the data. The data presented show that the presence of zeel-1 does not provide a fitness benefit to a peel-1(null) worm. But the experiment does not test whether zeel-1 is required for the increased fitness conferred by the presence of peel-1. Ideally, one would test whether a zeel-1(null);peel-1(+) strain is as fit as a zeel-1(+);peel-1(+) strain, but this experiment may be infeasible since a zeel-1(null);peel-1(+) strain is inviable. 2. The CRISPR-generated peel-1 allele in the N2 background only accounts for 32% of the fitness difference of the introgressed strain. Thus, the effect of peel-1 alone on fitness appears to be rather small. Additionally, this effect of peel-1 shows only weak statistical significance (and see point 5 below). Given that this is the key experiment in the paper, the major conclusion of the paper that the presence of peel-1 provides a fitness benefit is supported only weakly. For example, it is possible that other mutations caused by off-target effects of CRISPR in this strain may contribute to its decreased fitness. It would be valuable to point out the caveats to this conclusion, or back it up more strongly with additional experiments such as rescuing the peel-1(null) fitness defect with a wild-type peel-1 allele or determining if introduction of wild-type peel-1 into the introgressed strain is sufficient to confer a fitness benefit. 3. The strain that introgresses the zeel-1 peel-1 region from CB4856 into the N2 background was made by a different lab. Given that N2 strains from different labs can vary considerably, it is unclear whether this introgressed strain is indeed isogenic to the N2 strain it is competed against, or whether other background mutations outside the introgressed region may contribute to the observed fitness differences. 4. Though the CRISPR-generated null allele of peel-1 only accounts for 32% of the fitness difference of the zeel-1 peel-1 introgressed strain, these two strains have very similar fecundity and growth rates. Thus, it is unclear why this mutant does not more fully account for the fitness differences. 5. Improper statistical tests are used. All comparisons use a t test, but this test is inappropriate when multiple comparisons are made. Importantly, correction for multiple comparisons may decrease the already weak statistical significance of the fitness costs of the peel-1 CRISPR allele (Fig 3E), which is the key result in the paper. 6. N2 fecundity and growth rate measurements from Fig 2B&C are reused in Fig 3C&D. This should be explicitly stated. It should also be stated whether all three strains (N2, the zeel-1 peel-1 introgressed strain, and the peel-1 CRISPR mutant) were assayed in parallel as they should be. If so, a statistical test that corrects for multiple comparisons should also be used. 7. It appears that the same data for the controls for the fitness experiments (i.e. N2 vs. marker & N2 vs. introgressed npr-1; glb-5) may be reused in Fig 2A and 3E. If so, this should be stated. It should also be stated whether all the experiments in these panels were performed in parallel. If so, this may affect the statistical significance when correcting for multiple comparisons. Minor points 1. Though the mathematical modeling is interesting from a theoretical point of view, we feel that it oversells the rationale behind the experiments, setting up a “straw man” argument to knock down. Also, the modeling relies on rather high assumptions of the possible carrying cost of peel-1/zeel-1. For example, the modeling of the effect of outcrossing rate on peel-1/zeel-1 frequency assumes a selection coefficient of 0.35, which seems rather arbitrary and high. Where does this number come from? Is there any precedence for this high carrying cost? In our opinion, the idea that energy expenditure or leaky toxicity accounts for such a high carrying cost seems unlikely. 2. The two studies cited for “outcrossing rates typical for C. elegans” estimated vastly different outcrossing rates (~20% or ~1%). The model presented in Fig S1 specifically uses the lower estimates (0-2%), so the Sivasundar & Hey paper is miscited here. It is unclear whether there is a good rationale to go with the lower rate estimates. 3. The measurement of body-size is unclear in the main text. Only when reading methods did we realize that body-size is more of a proxy for growth rate rather than an end-point measurement of worm size. 4. What is the temporal distribution of egg laying of the N2 and N2peel-1(null) strains? Based on how the data collection is described in the Methods, the authors should already have these data. Does egg-laying start at the same time in the two strains? The fact that strains carrying peel-1 grow faster but also apparently produce more sperm (which might slow them down) makes an analysis of this worthwhile, especially since fitness depends on when eggs are laid, not just how many. Some more characterization of this fitness trait seems appropriate and useful for beginning to understand how peel-1 may be increasing fitness. Given that the number of sperm limits how many eggs are laid, the presence of peel-1 apparently results in more sperm. It is surprising that a gene exclusively expressed in developing sperm can lead to production of more sperm. 5. Line 65: the statement “similar elements have not been identified in obligate outcrossing Caenorhabditis nematodes” is somewhat misleading. TA elements may not have been identified in obligate outcrossing nematodes because of research bias since genetic experiments are easier to perform in non-obligate outcrossers and it is unclear that there have been extensive searches for TA elements in outcrossing nematodes. Furthermore, as the mathematical models in this study suggest, TA elements will spread quickly with increasing rate of outcrossing. Since a TA element’s non-fixation within a species has historically been a prerequisite for its discovery, the rapid TA element fixation that would generally occur in obligate outcrossers would make their identification more challenging. 6. Line 209-210: it is stated that this is the “first measurement of the fitness cost of a TA element to the host” and “first demonstration that a TA element can benefit the organism.” These claims may be overstated. It has been previously shown in several cases that TA elements can provide fitness benefits in bacteria, such as improved antibiotic resistance (e.g. Bogati et al. 2022, PMID: 34570627). 7. More details about the CRISPR protocol would be helpful. It is unclear whether Cas9/sgRNAs were introduced as RNPs or plasmids (and at what concentrations). It is unclear how worms were screened for edits. It is also unclear how many Dpy or Rol worms were screened and how many peel-1 or zeel-1 edited worms were found (the efficiency of CRISPR). The meaning of the shaded portion of the repairing oligo sequences in the table is not explained. Finally, it is not stated whether CRISPR-generated mutant strains were outcrossed.

Review synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. The preprint studied the conformational changes upon binding of the Akt protein kinase to the Akt active site inhibitor A-443654 and the Akt allosteric inhibitor MK-2206, under three states of Akt: inactive monophosphorylated, partially active tris-phosphorylated, and fully activated, tris-phosphorylated bound to PIP3 membranes. The MK-2206 resulted in allosteric conformational changes in all states and restricted membrane binding through sequestration of the PH domain. The A-443654 inhibitor led to allosteric conformational changes in the monophosphorylated and phosphorylated states, with increased protection in the PH domain upon membrane binding. The results can assist the design of Akt-targeted therapeutics. The reviewers had a few minor comments about the paper: It could be helpful to include a short explanation early in the text about the use of HDX-MS, how it works and why it is useful for exploring conformational changes.

Review synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. The preprint studies the process for mitochondrial targeting of  mitochondrial precursor proteins. Using a yeast model, experiments show that the cytosol transiently stores matrix-destined precursors in dedicated granules which the authors name MitoStores. The formation of MitoStores is controlled by the heat shock proteins Hsp42 and Hsp104, and suppresses the toxicity arising from non-imported accumulated mitochondrial precursor proteins. The manuscript is clear and well-written. The reviewers raised a few comments and suggestions as outlined below: The introduction was extremely clear and provides a good summary of the protein homeostasis dimension of the problem in question. However, there could be a clearer discussion of the processes of import, in particular with respect to the results discussing “clogging”. It is suggested to add a penultimate transitional paragraph in the introduction that facilitates this transition e.g. this could be expansion of the first paragraph in the Results section, moved into the introduction to provide more context about the cloggers, PACE, and the Rpn4-mediated proteasomal regulation.

Are there other proteins than proteosomes and chaperones which are significantly up- or down-regulated? STRING or cytoscape tools may help with the interactome analysis.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.16.473032v2#comment-6005651228,biorxivstage,1,"This manuscript investigates the cellular basis of reduced insulin secretion in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) by generating several independent INS-1-derived cell lines to model PWS. These PWS model cells have reduced insulin secretion and reduced levels of insulin and several other secreted peptides. A possible mechanism is suggested by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, demonstrating the reduced expression of a number of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones that may be important for proper folding of insulin; reduced levels of chaperones may lead to reductions in insulin levels, though it should be emphasized that this is just a model and hasn’t been tested. The experiments are performed well and the data are solid and convincing, though the effect sizes are of rather small magnitude and it is unclear how important the small effects seen here are to the pathophysiology of PWS. The extensive and rigorous molecular characterization of the mutations in the PWS model cell lines is a particular strength, and the fact that several independent PWS and control cell lines are generated increases the confidence in the results. The proteomic and transcriptomic datasets generated in this work are important contributions to the field. We have a number of relatively minor critiques, many related to the writing and presentation of the work. Specific comments: 1.	Though the data appear to be solid, virtually all of the effects are of small magnitude, < 2 fold (e.g. insulin secretion, altered expression of chaperones at both the mRNA and protein levels, ER-stress sensitivity). This is fine, but is not readily apparent from the way the paper is written (e.g. line 389, where insulin secretion is described as “dramatically reduced” or elsewhere where effect sizes can only be gleaned by careful examination of the figures). More transparency and explicit discussion of the effect sizes would be helpful. For instance, it would be helpful to compare the effect sizes seen here to those of PWS mouse models and human patients. 2.	The take-home model of the paper is that the effect on insulin in PWS is due to an indirect effect on chaperones. This is a reasonable and interesting model, but given that the magnitude of the downregulation of these chaperones is actually quite small (appears to be less than 2-fold for most or all of them), it seems possible that some other mechanism is at play and this may be a red herring. It is unclear whether such a modest decrease in multiple chaperones would produce the observed effects on insulin content and secretion, though it is an interesting question for future work. However, it would also be nice to see the full lists of proteomic data presented as supplementary tables for interested readers so possible alternative targets can be more easily explored. 3.	It is concluded that PWS cells are unable to compensate for decreases in chaperones because many chaperones are simultaneously downregulated. This argument does not make a lot of sense to us, and would seem to depend on the mechanism of compensation, which is not further described here. For example, if chaperone genes are transcriptionally downregulated in PWS mutants, what precludes an independent compensation mechanism from simply turning transcription back up, unless the PWS genes are important for the compensation process itself? It would help to present more about what is known about this compensation mechanism, and whether it occurs transcriptionally or posttranscriptionally. A small decrease in many chaperones does not inherently seem to preclude a possible compensation mechanism. 4.	The paper is rather difficult to read with lots of jargon and a poor narrative flow. The reader has to do a lot of work to figure things out on their own without much help. Several examples of this are provided in the next few comments(#5-8). 5.	Some genes or proteins come up quite suddenly without mentioning their functions or significance. For example, in lines 85-90, SNRPN, SNORD116 and SNORD107 have not been introduced yet as PWS genes, which makes the subsequent conclusion confusing that PWS genes function in beta cells. 6.	In several places in the proteomics and transcriptomics sections, there are long lists of genes or proteins with very little context to orient the reader. It is hard for the reader to make much of these lists, and some guidance as to why they are considered worth pointing out or short take-home messages in these sections would be useful. 7.	The description of engineering PWS INS-1 cells is quite hard to follow. Figure 1B is not very intuitive.  These sections demanded a lot of work from the reader, much of which required looking at supplementary figures to understand the main Results sections. As many readers may not look at these figures, it would help to make this section more accessible. 8.	The rationale for performing RNA-seq of small RNAs is not provided. This section ends up interrupting the main narrative and feeling tangential. 9.	Since PWS cells have altered levels of many proteins, it is unclear whether the total protein content is a good parameter to use for normalization of insulin secretion. 10.	It would help to see the unnormalized raw data for the insulin secretion experiments. Figure 2 shows pooled data from several cell lines. It would also be helpful to see the data for each line separately in a supplementary figure. 11.	It is not stated how many times proteomic and transcriptomic experiments were replicated. It is stated that each was performed on three control and three PWS cell lines, but it is unclear if each line was tested just once. It seems likely that the data depicted in the figures are pooled from the different lines though this is not stated explicitly. More clarity on these points would be useful. Separate figures for unpooled data of each cell line would also be useful in the Supplement so that variability between lines can be seen. 12.	The study emphasizes the deficits in secreted peptides and ER chaperones but doesn’t provide an explanation for proteins that are increased. A number of neuronal active zone proteins are reported to have increased expression at the mRNA level, but for most it is unclear whether this effect extends to the protein level (only CHGB is labeled in Figure 3). The possible relevance of these changes is also unclear. It is pointed out that many of these proteins may play a role in insulin secretion, but it is unclear why potentially increased levels would lead to the decreased secretion observed in PWS cells unless these factors are negative regulators of insulin secretion (though that seems unlikely given their neuronal functions). Thus, the relevance of these results is unclear. 13.	It would be helpful to explicitly state in the Results how many of the genes with reported changes in RNA levels were validated and were not validated by RT-PCR experiments. 14.	It is unclear whether it is standard practice to use an anti-KDEL antibody in Western blots to specifically identify GRP94 and GRP78, given that this antibody would be expected to recognize many proteins. If so, it would be helpful to cite other articles that validate this method or state the same thing. 15.	Electron microscopy images in Fig S17 show one picture of each cell line, leading to the conclusion that PWS cells have normal ultrastructure. It is unclear what criteria were used to make this apparently subjective conclusion (no quantitative data are presented). Also, there is no mention of how many cells and sections were examined. 16.	Fig S18: confocal cell images are difficult to assess. It would be helpful to zoom in on one cell for better comparison. As with EM data, it is unclear what criteria were used to compare the PWS cells to control and no quantitation is provided, nor is there mention of number of cells examined.

This is a way we can help science to go forward. And this is why we decided to publish our manuscript as a preprint, in order to have such a communication with the community (since we are not a N2-fixation group). Please find below a point-by-point answer on your comments. The title is indeed intriguing, however, it describes a really interesting and fascinating new phenomenon, and I am sure that you and several other colleagues wouldn't deal or discuss these findings if the title was not so ""provocative"". I can understand your concerns on something totally new, however, I cannot understand where did you extracted the information that we did not do “multiple re-plating to remove residual nitrogen within the cell”. Please remember that from a single microbial cell for being produced a visible colony on a plate needs hundreds cell cycles. Do you believe that remnants of nitrogen could support this? Regarding your comment “…media and agar with residual nitrogen”. If you carefully read our manuscript, you will understand that we screened >600 endophytic microbial isolates in this experiment. If the media and agar had residual nitrogen we would have also seen growth on a number of unrelated microbes. However, this was not the case in our experiments. Thank you for your suggestion on the pure agar. We did exactly what has been extensively published in the literature, using the protocols described in all these publications. On the other hand, we are a 20 years molecular and diagnostic microbiology Lab and of course we use pure agar (any residues would be a problem for us in any microbial identification). As a confirmation for this please see my comment on the 600 isolates screening in this work. Thank you for your comment on Mo and Fe. If you carefully read our manuscript, you will see that we describe agar plates (Suppl. Fig. 6) and not liquid media. Of course yeasts need Fe and this is the reason why they grow slowly and are stressed as we clearly describe in our manuscript. Your suggestion about the positive control is an excellent suggestion, thanks! Based on the contact with the community we had through this preprint, we now have already started a collaboration with a lab in USA and the Azotobacter vinelandii strain DJ and a ΔnifD mutant are on the way to Crete. Your question about the N2 consumption in a normal atmosphere is something that worried us, too. For this, we were measuring the pressure in every vial at the end of each experiment (no significant changes in pressure were detected), and of course we used the crimper in each assay for all vials. Indeed, the O2 is consumed, however other gas by-products are produced in the vial keeping the pressure stable or with minor changes. We observed the same N2-consumption in O2-rich conditions (respiration), as well as, in O2-free conditions (fermentation), so we did not “measure the change in partial pressure after the consumption of O2 in the vial” as you mention. I would like to mention that Prof. Kotzabasis (co-author) is a ~30 years’ expert on analytical methods like GC-TCD. Your suggestion for 15N gas enrichment is already discussed and agreed with our collaborator in USA (we are not experts on this assay). Regarding the ammonia measurement: If you carefully read our manuscript, you will find information regarding a publication where the authors describe the production of NH4+ when yeasts are grown in Raffinose–NFYM (N2-free yeast medium), Raffinose–NFMM (N2-free mineral medium) and Mannitol–NFMM, so this is already published. For the first draft of our preprint we decided not to repeat these assays, however, we have just received the related kit for repeating them. Regarding your comment “…GC dinitrogen consumption assays…”: This is the surprising point of our discovery! We observed that this biological phenomenon seems to be active in various cultivation conditions (pοοr or rich media; presence or absence of O2, etc.). Of course we have also measured this phenomenon on N2-free liquid media. However, since it also occurs in YPD, I cannot understand why not to use it. Regarding your question on “why would yeast be fixing large amounts of nitrogen when it's freely available?” I have to say I don’t know! However, I would suggest to stop thinking on this phenomenon like we think on the prokaryotic N2-fixation. We don’t know what the mechanism is or if it is less energetic, etc. On the other hand even in prokaryotic N2-fixation organisms, the phenomenon is not so energy consuming as it was initially believed, so it can run in parallel to respiration. But, at the moment we can only speculate... Please google “nitrogen fixation by yeast”, you will be surprised. Like you, we also did not have an idea about the very old observation/claim that some yeast and fungi can grow using atmospheric N2… However, when we initially observed this phenomenon in my lab, we started looking for evidence in the literature and we found some very old literature (e.g. Nitrogen Fixation by Soil Yeasts, Nature, 1954. Nitrogen Fixation by yeasts and other fungi, Nature, 1911, etc.). Apart of these very old reports nobody else has ever investigated the ability of yeast to grow without nitrogen sources this is why no one has seen this in the past. The calibration for the quantification of N2 and O2 volume, has been done by the company provided and maintaining our GC-TCD equipment, by injecting known quantities in the GC-TCD (N2: r2=0,9983; O2: r2=0,9953). As I mentioned before Prof. Kotzabasis (co-author) is a ~30 years’ expert on analytical methods like GC-TCD. The PCR assay has been performed following a treatment with a cocktail of 6 antibiotics and multiple re-cultivations in antibiotic containing media… please be sure that no bacteria could survive this treatment. The protocol for the elimination of bacterial endophytes has been extensively used and has been published in the literature. The 16S primers that we used are common and have been used extensively by a great number of Labs around the globe. When you say “the small amount of growth seen on plates” I am wondering if you have carefully seen the growth in our Fig 1. I will remind you here (as I have mentioned above) that other groups have also observed this phenomenon in the past, however, without proceeding to its analysis. As a conclusion of this text exchange, I would keep your very helpful suggestion on a positive control in GC-TCD assays, as well as, your suggestion on 15N measurement.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.12.464130v2#comment-6004434714,biorxivstage,1,"A few concerns have been raised about this manuscript that we wish to address specifically here as well as in a second version of this preprint. Concern 1: We report a large number of eccDNA breakpoints in our samples in this manuscript. This large number and diversity of eccDNAs could be the result of contaminating linear DNA. This contaminating linear could call into question our results. In general, our pipeline could be calling other artefacts as eccDNAs, and has not been as thoroughly vetted as other previously published pipelines. Our response: •	We have performed a thorough degradation of linear DNA in all our samples which follows the standards set by our colleagues in the field. We also verified this degradation using qPCR. •	We provide two PCR experiments that support our claims of little to no linear DNA contamination in our samples. •	We used split reads and discordant reads to identify eccDNA forming regions. Any remaining linear DNA that was directly sequenced would not result in either of these read variants and would therefore not result in calls by our pipeline. We verified this by running our pipeline on whole genome sequencing data from other studies. •	While the phi29 polymerase prefers to amplify circular DNA, contaminating linear DNA may also be amplified, resulting in multimeric sequences that, when sequenced, result in split reads and therefore eccDNA calls by our pipeline. This is an accepted weakness of this protocol in the field. However, this method is still widely used by our colleagues, pointing to the fact that this weakness is not enough to invalidate the analysis of eccDNA sequencing data. Clearly, the preference of the phi29 polymerase for circular DNA is strong enough to allow meaningful analysis. All of the data we re-analyzed in this study used the phi29 amplification protocol and therefore would have been similarly affected by linear DNA contamination, but these samples did not show the abundance of eccDNAs we saw in M. oryzae. •	We sequenced O. sativa samples in addition to our M. oryzae samples to verify that our lab methods were not the source of our observations in M. oryzae. Our sequenced O. sativa samples appeared very similar to the samples produced by a previous study across many characteristics and looked very different from what we saw in M. oryzae. Specifically, the number of eccDNAs identified in those samples were much smaller than in M. oryzae. •	We compared our called eccDNA forming regions to those called using the same sequencing data by a previous study (Møller et al. 2018) and found that our results were largely similar, and our criteria for eccDNA calling was more stringent than those previously published. •	Other previously published pipelines, like ecc_finder, use peaks of sequencing reads in the genome as the primary basis for identifying eccDNAs in the genome. However, given the large diversity of eccDNAs we found in M. oryzae we were unable to rely on a peak calling based approach for our data, and instead wrote our own pipeline that relies entirely on split-mapping reads and opposite facing read pairs which are strong evidence of eccDNAs, and used in conjunction with peak-calling in other pipelines. •	We also compared our Illumina called eccDNAs to eccDNAs called using PacBio data in the same samples. This data is much easier to interpret as long split reads are clear evidence of eccDNA formation. We found substantial overlap between eccDNAs called using our Illumina data and using our PacBio data. Concern 2: We report very little overlap in eccDNA breakpoints between samples, especially among technical replicates, which calls into question the results, especially when it comes to the relevance of genes being found on eccDNAs. This little overlap, combined with potential linear DNA contamination, could point to this study simply over-analyzing noisy data without biological significance. While we explain this lack of overlap by pointing, in part, to under-sequencing, we also claim that this cannot be the reason a subset of genes are never present on eccDNAs in our data which seems contradictory. Our response: •	The number of eccDNA forming regions we identified in each of our technical replicates suggests that each sample contained an extremely large number of distinct eccDNA molecules. Our analysis of split read counts per eccDNA showed that the majority of these eccDNA molecules were very likely present at very low copy numbers. Furthermore, replication of individual eccDNA molecules in M. oryzae is likely to be very rare or non-existent. •	We split our technical replicates after DNA extraction. Given the hugely diverse population of low copy number eccDNAs in each of these samples, it is extremely likely that some eccDNAs ended up in one aliquot and not the others. This likely explains the lack of overlap in exact breakpoints between technical replicates. •	We also showed that increasing our sequencing coverage per technical replicate likely would have led to better overlap between technical replicates. However, this likely would not have completely solved the problem given the low copy number of the eccDNAs. •	Given the little overlap in breakpoints between samples, we instead sought to analyze the hotspots and coldspots for eccDNA formation in the genome. We felt that this analysis was meaningful because, while our technical replicates did not share exact breakpoints, they did share many approximate breakpoints (if we allow boundaries to be within 100 bp of each other, for example) pointing to the existence of these hotspots. We compared this overlap in breakpoints to our expected overlap if we had sequenced random segments of the genome in each sample and found no such overlap. •	We chose to focus on these hotspots and coldspots by taking a gene-based perspective and counting how often M. oryzae genes were fully contained within eccDNAs in our data, regardless of the exact breakpoints of the eccDNAs. This helped us identify a group of genes that we never found fully contained within an eccDNA in any of our samples. In this case, we were able to show, through rarefaction and permutation analyses, that we do not expect that increasing our sequencing coverage would have led to the discovery of all of these genes in our samples. We used this analysis as evidence that, while under sequencing may have affected our ability to detect overlap in exact breakpoints between samples, it did not explain this observation.",2022-10-05T17:10:51,pmjoubert,Pierre Joubert,10.1101/2021.10.12.464130,"The extrachromosomal circular DNAs of the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae contain a wide variety of LTR retrotransposons, genes, and effectors","Pierre M.

Review synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. In this preprint Munhoz et al. identify adiponectin as the main effector of the protective effects of sera from lean women and calorie-restricted rats on beta-cell integrity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The study reports that sera from obese humans and rats impairs beta-cell integrity and insulin secretion in the absence of nutrient overload. This observation implies that changes in circulating factors between obese and lean individuals would explain the effects on beta-cell function. The levels of circulating adiponectin in rat sera and human plasma were consistent with the metabolic effects observed in beta-cells. Finally, adding adiponectin to islet cultures that were incubated with sera from obese individuals restored beta-cell integrity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The data are reported in a clear way and the manuscript is well written. Data are consistent with a role of adiponectin in the observed protective effects, but some additional experiments are suggested to clarify this role. Major comments The paper states that adiponectin is necessary to maintain islet function and integrity. According to the data reported, it is recommended to amend the conclusions to indicate that adiponectin is “sufficient”. A key experiment to demonstrate that adiponectin  is necessary would be to deplete the sera of adiponectin and then evaluate the same parameters on beta-cells/islet primary culture. Adiponectin-receptor KO beta-cells would also help to clarify the role of adiponectin in the protective effects of sera. It may also be worth exploring if there were other hormones or other components beyond adiponectin which may have the similar increase in serum samples. In Figure 3A/3B, a picture of the corresponding Ponceau used for quantification should be shown next to the adiponectin blot. It would also be helpful to provide the full raw blots as supplementary files to allow for further evaluation, e.g. there seems to be a faint band in 3A above the predicted band which might be cropped in 3B, and there seems to be some difference in protein migration in different samples. Please show as a supplementary figure the full blot for adiponectin with all the samples shown in quantification. In the blot in Figure 3B there does not appear to be a clear difference between adiponectin levels in lean vs obese women, which would argue against adiponectin having a beneficial metabolic effect when treating beta-cells. It would be useful to provide some further comments on this possible discrepancy. Figure 4E compares different amounts of glucose with either FBS or no serum+adiponectin. Another condition with only no serum + vehicle for adiponectin should be included as a negative control, as shown in Figure 5. Minor comments Abstract - Please specify in which model (cell/islet culture) the effects are observed. Sex-specific differences - The findings in humans are really interesting. However, only male rats are reported in this manuscript. Would there be any difference between male and female CR-rats sera when applied to beta-cells? This experiment would be a great addition to the paper. If the experiment cannot be completed at this time, there should be a mention to this limitation in the discussion. Results ‘ Fig. 1A shows that the animals on the CR diet gained significantly less weight over the course of 15 weeks, but did not lose mass’ - This text refers to mass, the figure legend says weight, the y axis title on the figure states body mass. Please clarify for consistency. Results  ‘ They were within the same age range (Table 1), but were clearly distinct in body mass indexes (BMI), which separated them into lean and obese groups: lean women (BMI 22 ± 0.9, Fig. 2B) ’ - Please clarify the reference to Figure 2B in this fragment as the figure does not report BMI. Results ‘ these results show a clear modulatory effect of circulating blood factors on metabolic fluxes in β-cells, which are stimulated by factors present in samples from lean and female subjects. ’ - It is interesting that this is only observed for females, does this suggest that there may be sex-related factors involved, instead of or in addition to diet status? Could some further comment be added as to why the effect may only be observed in females. Please mention in the abstract/discussion that the results are obtained from in vitro experiments using beta-cells and islet primary cultures. Conclusions: suggest specifying  “in the blood of lean rats ” in the fragment that states “... in the blood of lean animals ”. Methods Please report the method of euthanasia. ‘experiments were carried out in accordance with the A. C.

My opinion is that this manuscript offers little evidence of these stated results. My biggest concern is the contamination of media and agar with residual nitrogen and the lack of multiple replatings to remove residual nitrogen within the cell. Besides the statement on line 23, the authors do not list how many times the yeast strains were replated on nitrogen-free agar to confirm that residual nitrogen is not being used. Regular agar tends to have some small amount of nitrogen left over from its purification process. We have experienced that nitrogen-fixing bacteria will not derepress nitrogenase unless on pure agar. We use noble agar to make nitrogen-free plates. But for these experiments where absolute proof is required, I suggest using electrophoresis grade agarose as the thickening agent of plates For the media lacking Mo and Fe, was chelating or acid washing of the growth bottles performed to remove Fe and Mo? Does yeast require some Fe for growth? Suppl Fig 6 does not seem the yeast grew very well compared to Fig 1. Therefore it seems that Mo or Fe might be required, or there are residual metals or nitrogen in the media. A positive control in parallel with an acetylene reductase assay is required for the GC-TCD dinitrogen consumption assays. This will show that known biological nitrogen fixation bacteria act similarly to the yeast in your experiment. Azotobacter vinelandii is a model aerobic diazotroph with lots of experimental data to compare to. I am afraid the dinitrogen consumption assay is a very unusual way of determining nitrogen fixation in a normal atmosphere. Most N2 consumption assays are performed in vitro with nitrogenase under an argon atmosphere as one can measure the change in concentration of N2. I am afraid the authors are measuring the change in partial pressure after the consumption of O2 in the vial. 15N gas enrichment or 15N natural abundance assay must be performed to confirm atmospheric dinitrogen assimilation. Ammonia or the total N of the cells is never measured. Therefore, it should be easy to compare the biomass before and after and determine if there is more nitrogen in the bioreactor. Why are the GC dinitrogen consumption assays performed on media with added nitrogen? Where are the assays with nitrogen-free media? Biologically why would yeast be fixing large amounts of nitrogen when it's freely available? S. cerevisiae is one, if not the most, studied organisms in the history of biology. Is there any evidence in the literature that provides any clues that it is fixing nitrogen under ammonia-supplemented conditions? Please provide a standard curve of nitrogen and oxygen for the GC data. How do you calculate the initial N2 concentration in the headspace? Suppl Fig 10. The 16s primers seem to not work well on the positive control of E. coli. If a small population of bacteria was symbiotic with the yeast, this gel does not show they are not there. The authors have failed to produce any convincing evidence that yeast strains can fix atmospheric nitrogen. While careful experimentation and multiple controls might still prove their hypothesis correct, contamination from nitrogen in the media or a diazotrophic bacteria is most likely allowing the small amount of growth seen on plates. In addition, the GC assay does not have proper controls and is inadequate to show nitrogen fixation.",2022-10-03T20:00:55,alexanderalleman,Alexander Alleman,10.1101/2022.09.29.510055,Atmospheric nitrogen fixation by eukaryotes: Should we reconsider the nitrogen cycle in nature?,"Nikolaos Arapitsas, Christos A.

Review synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. The preprint examines the meiotic recombination co-factor MND1 and its role in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in somatic cells. The paper reports that MND1 stimulates DNA repair through homologous recombination (HR) but is not involved in the response to replication-associated DSBs. MND1 localization to DSBs occurs through direct binding to RAD51-coated ssDNA. MND1 loss potentiates the G2 DNA damage checkpoint and the toxicity of IR-induced damage, opening avenues for therapeutic intervention, particularly in HR-proficient tumors. The reviewers raised some minor comments and suggestions on the work: Results ‘ Therefore, we conclude that MND1-HOP2 are ubiquitously expressed proteins’ - we understand that the study looked at the transcript's expression level and not protein levels, consider revising this sentence. Figure 1F - Due to the differences in intensity for the loading control, recommend quantifying the normalized level of MND1. ‘we used live-cell imaging of RPE1 cells’ - Are these cells p53 KO? In Suppl. Figure 1K, RPE Delpta-p53 cells are used , but the HALO tag was introduced in the normal (WT) RPE cells. Could some clarification be provided for this difference, and report what's the level of MND1 and the effects of its loss in WT RPE cells? ‘Analysis of 53BP1 foci formation and resolution in asynchronously growing RPE1 cells revealed that MND1 depletion leads to slower repair and retention of DSBs after IR (Figure 2A, Suppl. Figure 2F&G)’ - While the quantification shown in Figure 2A is explicit, the foci in the raw images displayed in Suppl. Figure 2G appears to be more frequent in the siNT, especially in the last 2 time points. It may be worth making the images bigger and maybe clearer? ‘our data show that the role of MND1 in DNA repair is most prominent in G2 phase cells and restricted to repair of two-ended DSBs’ - Can some further context be provided for the last part of this claim. Is this due to the different modes of action of the different drugs used? If so, it would be nice to clarify in the text which drugs induce the two-ended DSBs. ‘These data show that MND1 is recruited to sites of DSBs’ - The data shows that there is an increase in MND1 foci, but whether these are or not the sites of DSBs is not clear. Recommend co-staining with a known DSBs marker. Methods - Haploid genetic screen  - Please describe how cells were fixed. - Please detail if/what software was used for the Fisher’s exact test. - ‘Cells were fixed after 7 days of growth in 80% methanol and stained with 0.2% crystal violet’ - Please report at which temperature and for how long the steps were completed, and provide a reference for the crystal violet reagent. - ‘Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA’ - Please report the temperature and duration for this step. - Please describe how the propidium iodide staining was performed.",2022-10-03T09:55:42,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2022.08.24.505076,MND1 enables repair of two-ended DNA double-strand breaks,"Lisa Koob, Anoek Friskes, Louise van Bergen, Femke M.

Review synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. The preprint studies the molecular function of Arl15, a member of the Arf-like GTPases (Arls) group, which has been linked to magnesium homeostasis. The manuscript reports that Arl15 localizes in the Golgi and plasma membrane, including filopodia. The dissociation of Golgi or the expression of Arf1 dominant-negative mutant leads to a mislocalization of Arl15 to the cytosol. Knocking down Arl15 results in reduced filopodial number, altered focal adhesion kinase organization, and enhanced cargo uptake. Arl15 knockdown decreases cell migration and enhances cell spreading and adhesion strength. The findings point to a functional role for Arl15 in the Golgi. General comments Figures 1,2, 3 - The images display one representative example, recommend providing quantification (e.g. PCC/Manders) across several biological replicates, as well as information on the type of images reported, single slice, max Z projection etc. For the bar plots, the paper reports the number of cells as well as the number of times the experiment was repeated, which is excellent. However, it is unclear whether the SEM error bars and p-values were calculated based on the number of repeats (correct) or based on the number of cells (incorrect). Can clarification be provided for this point. See https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb... and https://doi.org/10.1371/jou.... Throughout the paper there are several references to ‘data not shown’ - please report the data for those items. Specific comments Introduction, first paragraph - Suggest shortening the paragraph, particularly regarding the description of the different Arls and their relationship/correlation with all diseases. ‘These results show that similar to HeLa cells, Arl15-GFP localizes to PM along with filopodia and Golgi in all mammalian cell types’ - Suggest revising the fragment to ‘all the mammalian cell types tested in the study’, to avoid generalizing to every mammalian cell type. ‘the localization of Arl15-GFP to PM however remained unchanged as compared to DMSO treated cells (Fig. 2A). ’ - Fig 2A only compares mCherry-UtrCH against Arl15-GFP. To support this claim, Arl15-GFP would need to be compared to WGA-AF, as in Figure 1, and their colocalization quantified to confirm that it remained unchanged. ‘We treated mCherry-UtrCH expressing HeLa:Arl15-GFP stable cells with a small molecular inhibitor of Rac1 (CAS 1177865-17-6) or Cdc42 (ML141)’ - Please report the concentration of both inhibitors. ‘Overall, these studies indicate that neither actin depolymerization nor the key regulatory molecules of filopodia/lamellipodia affect the localization of Arl15 to PM/Golgi.’ - The visualization reports Arl15-GFP v mCherry-UtrCH, to support the claim please check against WGA/GM130 as in Figure 1. Also, Figure 2c Arl15 for FAK inhibitor looks different from the DMSO control, recommend confirmation with WGA staining. Can also some explanation be provided for the fact that the Arl-15 in Figure 2A and 2C DMSO looks quite different from 2B and 2D despite the stable cell line with uniform expression? ‘which mislocalized Golgi pool of Arl15 without affecting its PM localization (Fig. 2D)’ - There does not seem to be a marked difference in Arl15-GFP's intracelluar localisation in cells with and without microtubules, and the PM signal appears slightly reduced in the Nocodazole-treated cells. Is it possible to please quantify the localisation? Figure 2 -The quality of the images from panels B and D looks very different from those of A and C. Can some clarification be provided, were the same microscope, camera, and settings used? Figure 3 - It would be good to mention the role of brefeldin A as an ATPase inhibitor to provide context for why it is being used. ‘Surprisingly, Arl15-GFP localized to the cytosol as similar to Arf1-GFP in GM130 dispersed cells that are indicative of brefeldin A treatment in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A).’ - It may be worth clarifying the reference to a surprising result, considering the nocadozol results would this result not be expected? It may also be worth providing some comments about the possible PM localisation difference when Golgi is disrupted with nocadozol vs BrefeldinA/golgicide A. It seems that the PM localisation is also affected in the BrefeldinA/golgicideA treatments. Figure 3A ‘ Cells were treated with DMSO (as control), brefeldin A or golgicide A for 24 h followed fixation’ - Please comment on the 24-hour period, BFA would be expected to work in minutes timescale: https://rupress.org/jcb/art... Supplementary Fig 2A - The blots for Arl15 endogenous are very different between S2A and S2B. Also a 40% knockdown of Arf1 decreases the level of Arl15 by 17%. Can some comments be provided on the significance of this decrease. Figure 4 - Is the SEM over 3 independent experiments or total number of cells from the three experiments? What was the criteria used to define a structure as filopodia? ‘However, we continued with Arl15V80A,A86L,E122K cytosolic mutant to study the functionality of Arl15 in HeLa cells ’ - It may be worth specifying the reason to use the V80A,A86L,E122K form instead of the more simple V80A alone? ‘To test whether the mislocalized Cav-2 and STX6 are targeted to lysosomes in siArl15 cells’ - Please comment on why colocalisation with lysotracker or lamp1 positive structures was not examined  instead of treating the cells with bafilomycin A1? Note that bafilomycin A1 also inhibits retrograde membrane traffic at the ER–Golgi boundary: https://www.molbiolcell.org... Figure 5 -  Please clarify whether the quantification of images was done on images taken from the same microscope? Also, suggest arranging the figures in a way that the quantification and images are not so far apart from each other. Figure 5D - It is unclear how the western blot of EGFR showing total EGFR is indicative of what happened to its trafficking, this appears to be in contrast to the increase in transferrin uptake data. Recommend normalizing the transferrin uptake to surface transferrin levels as one can have higher uptake simply because there is more transferrin receptor instead of actual changes in trafficking rates. ‘Nevertheless, the reason for the partial loss of STX6 and caveolin-2 localization from Golgi in the ASAP1/2 knockdown cells requires investigation’ - Text earlier mentioned ""However, we have not observed any significant change in Arl15 and its dependent cargo (caveolin-2 and STX6) localization to Golgi in siASAP1/2 cells "" and there does not appear to be any difference in the siASAP1 or siASAP2 on Fig 6.

This manuscript examines how the two transactivation domains (TADs) of β-catenin interact with several domains of CBP/p300 to potentially control transcriptional activation. A combination of biochemistry, NMR, and ITC studies narrow down several binding sites for TAZ1 and TAZ2 domains. Overall, the manuscript is well organized and provides new details on these interactions that may play a role in β-catenin function. We have some suggestions that might enhance the clarity of the work below. Thanks for an enjoyable read! Figure 1: •	The schematics do not depict consistent widths/domain lengths and CBP/p300 is missing some domains, including one implicated in β-catenin binding (Emami et al. 2004, PNAS). •	It would be helpful if your schematic also illustrated all of the constructs used in the study and these names were used consistently. •	If space allows, a simplified diagram of the pathway described in the text could be helpful. Figure 2: •	It would be helpful to add dashed line for predicted secondary structure cut-off at 0.3 in panel B. •	It would enhance the rigor of the work to show expression levels for the constructs used in panel C. Figure 3: •	Labeling the MW markers, light and heavy IgG chains, and proteins (does the 666-781 fragment overlap with the light chain?) in panel A, along with the input, would make this figure easier to read. •	The results of the pulldown seem pretty straightforward so quantification from n = 2 experiments seems unnecessary. If you do so, please define what ‘relative’ means in the quantification and make sure that your statistical methodologies are appropriate for this low n. Figure 4: •	There is some concern that the ITC data might be overfit to a two-site binding model without more information on the fits.  Additional rationale or evidence that justifies use of the two-site model would also be welcome. Figures 5 & 7: •	It might be easier to interpret the binding interface if you used surface representation for the TAZ domains instead of ribbon. Figure 8: •	It was a bit confusing to show an analysis of the NMR data from the construct used in Fig. S3 in panel A,  but then use data in panels B – E from a larger construct. We struggled a bit throughout the manuscript to match domain names and fragments (see Fig. 1 comment above) with the data. •	It could be helpful to conclude with a cartoon or schematic that illustrates what was learned here. Other: •	Discussion text mentions a possible role for phosphorylation of serines; if citations for this exist, please add them or perhaps broaden this to a possible role for PTMs in general. •	Consistent labeling of ITC data throughout the paper would help clarify which fragments of b-catenin were used in each experiment.",2022-10-02T17:56:40,carriepartch,Carrie Partch,10.1101/2022.08.30.505852,β-catenin interacts with the TAZ1 and TAZ2 domains of CBP/p300 to activate gene transcription,"Alexandra D.

Might the fastest grower in each pair/trio reach the highest concentration, limit the growth of other species, and therefore provide an effect quite similar to itself in isolation?

What we show in Figure 5 are neither the number of genes nor the number of proteins, but the number of different mRNA transcript contigs. You are correct that this number is not the same as the gene number, and that's why the categories of the x-axis are not written in italics. However, this number strongly correlates with the gene number (the more genes, the more distinct transcripts). We are having a look at this issue at the moment and we might replace the mRNA transcript contig number by the gene number. However, that requires us to go through them one-by-one and identify those that are splice isoforms originating from one-and-the-same gene.

How precisely tagged ensembles relate to the engram, or memory trace, is still not clear. Another important question is how do tagged ensembles mature or change over time and what is the precise engram that is required for remote memory recall. This preprint shows strong data supporting the idea of overlapping, but distinct ensembles involved in recent and remote memories. The authors show that tagged ensembles change their network connectivity over time, using innovative viral tracing techniques. For example, dCA1 neurons that project to the ACC are more likely to be engram cells at remote recall than recent recall timepoints, and fewer ACC to dCA1 cells are active at remote recall compared to recent recall time points. We think there are some additions that could be made to improve the conclusions and data presentation: 1.Showing individual data-points for all bar graphs would improve the interpretability of the data throughout the paper. We also noticed that in some experiments, the N values for controls vs manipulated/activated animals is vastly different (eg Fig. 4). 2. Include individual statistical tests in each figure/panel. 3.The authors quantify the overlap of engrams tagged at different time points by calculating the overlap compared to expected overlap. While this is useful to show that Fos-tagged ensembles are not random, we believe it is important to also include the absolute percentage of overlapping cells to determine the similarity of engrams. It appears from the IHC images that the absolute overlap is a low percentage of the total number of neurons tagged as engram cells at any particular timepoint. This should also include the total % of Fos-tagged cells in each experiment. Since the total % would greatly alter the expected value by chance. Indeed, in many cases it seems that there is less than the expected chance value indicating that ensembles are not activated randomly but may be distinct. 4. We appreciate the design of the first set of functional experiments where 4-OHT is administered during recall (Fig 1K). This approach shows that the same cells active in the recent recall engram are those inhibited by CNO a month later at the remote test. To take this experiment one step further, one could add a group where 4-OHT treatment is administered 2 days post-acquisition without a recall test, or with a recall test in a different context, and evaluation of fear conditioning at the remote time-point. This would be a convincing way to show that CNO is not simply inhibiting enough neurons to block the remote memory, but rather that it is the activity of those specific neurons in the original recall engram which are necessary for remote recall.

The notion of optimal coding is a further speculation: the mossy fiber - granule cell pathway is anatomically relevant to favor the implementation of internal models within the system, as MFs are sending redundant projections to send information to various locations of the cerebellar cortex. To date, there's no evidence suggesting that MF-GC projections are re-routed within the lifetime of an animal (plasticity may occur, however hard wiring is genetically driven) and therefore I see the MF system as an invariant frame. On the other hand, we have evidence that most of GC-PC synapses are silent, and Purkinje cells select relevant GC synapses based on activity. Ultimately, information can be adaptively routed within the system but it cannot override or outbound the anatomical constraint of the MF-GC pathway.

Peidli et al. present a data resource (for single-cell perturbations) and apply energy distance (e-distance) to quantify differences in perturbations. For the data resource, the authors focus on curating single-cell RNAseq and ATACseq measurements perturbed with CRISPR, drug treatments, and a few other perturbation types. The authors curate a total of 44 datasets. Overall, the paper is very well written with a sound logical flow. However, many elements of the paper seem incomplete. We provide several specific comments regarding our views on how the paper could improve. We thank the authors for posting their preprint and code publicly. Our two primary comments are: 1. The data are not harmonized from reads. Instead, the authors process (in most cases) already processed read count by gene matrices. The authors also use different versions of scanpy to process different datasets. This is definitely still valuable, but the authors should state these facts earlier and probably decrease the use of “harmonization”. Additionally, there is no evaluation to determine the effect or benefit of this read count harmonization. Calculating e-distance before and after harmonization across datasets might be helpful. 2. E-distance is not sufficiently benchmarked. The math and intuition are described marvelously, but how does E-distance behave across datasets and common perturbations? How does subsampling read depth impact E-distance calculations? How does drug dose impact e-distance? How does sequencing technology impact e-distance? How does modifying the distance metric within the E-distance calculation impact calculations? We also have several general comments on different aspects of the paper and github repository. We hope that the authors can benefit from our deep dive on the paper. Thanks again! Introduction - Definition of single-cell perturbation data (SCPD) Overall, this subsection is more of a “methods/techniques overview” of how to collect SCPD rather than defining what SCPD actually is. What is output from these techniques? - The authors should define these data in more detail. - The authors should also further define the techniques as it is helpful to have a general idea of why the data collected from the techniques are “good” and not just “more data are better”. Motivation for distance measure of high-dimensional profiles: - The authors claim that E-distance can identify strong or weak perturbations. It’s unclear what a strong or weak perturbation is. I was unable to find this information from a quick google search so I think they should define that here (not found in methods either). Motivation for unifying datasets - Their motivation only seems to be “it doesn’t exist yet because it’s difficult to do” so therefore we should do it. What will/could come of the integrated and standardized datasets? What would we hope to find? Web Interface - The authors claim, “a web interface for data access, analysis and visualization is available at scperturb.org.” There is data access on that site, but analysis and visualization appear to be absent using Brave and Safari browsers. - It seems that one would require a computer with enough memory (500G) to run scPerturb to reproduce the analysis. The authors present solutions for how to overcome these requirements, but it did not seem that they attempted to solve them. - The authors state that there are Quality Control plots for each dataset on the website but we could not find. Results - The authors should briefly describe the methods underlying the statement “dense low-dimensional embeddings of the original data (see Methods for details)” in a bit more detail upon introduction. - It is surprising to me that there are so many cells with 2 perturbations (proportionally to a single perturbation) (sup fig 1). Is this because of an overweighting of a specific study? - It might be helpful to add targeted sequencing depth to table 1 per study, also helpful to add the sequencing platforms used. - Data source trust: Zenodo sources appear to be auxiliary data downloads as opposed to direct sources. How might other researchers assume trust in the sources? Are the included metadata implied or entrusted to the authors? - Are the UMAPs in Figure 3E the same UMAP space or are the spaces fit independently in both panels? - Need to provide a bit more rationale for why the authors chose E-distance over the other options. - Did they calculate E-distance for all perturbations? Sup Fig 3 shows this, so maybe? It was not obvious where to find the measurements. - There are only 11 drug perturbations in common. This is a very interesting observation! How many genes are perturbed in common datasets? Methods - For the scATAC-Seq data, it’s not clear to me if they perform LSI jointly across all samples or not. This would cause non-interoperability across datasets if not done jointly since each LSI dimension may mean something different in each dataset. In addition, they provide peaks x counts matrix -- which is dataset specific. I would suggest aligning jointly using a uniform set of peaks -- Running MACS2 on all datasets would be a huge benefit to the community. - How do the different versions of scanpy impact data processing? Typically, harmonized data are generated with a single pipeline. - When performing subsampling to fit PCA, did the authors transform the full data subsequently? In other words, does the PCA fitting step impact cell count for e-distance calculation? - What distance measure is used in the E-distance calculation for ||x_i - x_J||? L2? For perturbations, comparing L2 to other metrics would help benchmark the method. Code/Github - It seems to us a good idea to spend time improving the existing model / code at https://github.com/theislab.... The authors should justify why they are not contributing to existing open source code. - I can’t find the script “fragments2outputs.R” in their github. From their paper: “All features described in the overview above were computed with ArchR functions. For details inspect the “fragments2outputs.R” script in our code repository (see Data Availability).” Data Repo comments: - Manual data testing for reproducibility within https://github.com/sanderla... (one must perform the steps, the repo doesn’t provide or outline within the code itself) - Suggests using “mamba” but does not provide instructions on how to install mamba - Would suggest a small description for each folder in the directory (README) explaining its contents - There’s no usage example on how to download the data or use the program - Would  be best to have a notebook (or bash script) that describes the entire workflow. - The notebooks are not sequentially executed and there are no execution instructions - What environment (OS/hardware/configuration/etc) is required to run the code? - Is notebook (.ipynb) output expected within committed code? (should these have been scrubbed with nbconvert/jupytext?) Data Availability - Based on this section, their website only contains the first three bullet points (e.g scRNA-seq data, scATAC-seq data, and details about the datasets). We could not easily find the last three bullet points (Quality control plots for each dataset, Filtering, e.g., by readout or type of perturbation, Commands for direct file download using the Unix command curl) This review was produced jointly at The University of Colorado by: Gregory P.

I had a bit of trouble understanding one thing though: how do you prevent or even correct for false positives in this procedure? Could you measure FPR? It seems to me that the narrow selection of literature (enriched in associations with Depression/AD), the relatively long reasoning chains, and the paths through hub nodes such as ""Nervous System Process"" can very easily result in hits that ""biologically make sense""; what prevents this process from just returning each and every entity that is connected to one of the parent nodes of Depression and AD? You even encourage hierarchical chains, so the chance for parent hub nodes is almost 1 I would assume. Generally, what is the reasoning for allowing these chains to cross through nodes with such low specificity?",2022-09-18T23:37:46,,Sebastian,10.1101/2022.07.18.500549,Causal feature selection using a knowledge graph combining structured knowledge from the biomedical literature and ontologies: a use case studying depression as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease,"Scott A.

The purpose of the current release is merely to describe the deep learning approach and we feel that information provided is sufficient for qualified researchers to recapitulate the computational strategies. While reporting repellency in terms of protection, e.g. complete protection time, would indeed be appropriate in the context of acquiring data for registering and labeling of repellent products (per EPA & WHO guidelines), we recognise the added complexity of such studies. The complete protection time of a specific repellent can (partially) be tuned using traditional and more advanced formulations, e.g. by influencing speed of release and rate of absorption by the skin. We, therefore, think that the potency of the repellents (e.g. expressed as ED50) would be a more suitable metric at the stage of compound discovery, and complete protection time is a more suitable metric in a product development stage. We agree that a good repellent should provide approximately 100% protection from mosquito bites for several hours, in the context of topically applied repellents (typically 300-400 ug/cm2). Please note that we tested compounds at very low densities (25 ug/cm2 and 13 ug/cm2 in our membrane feeding assay and arm-by-cage assay, respectively) in order to be able to pick up responses that outperform current gold standard repellents (DEET and picaridin). As exemplified in Figure 2E the percentage protection goes up with increasing dose, and the exact nature of this dose-response relationship is the focus of our current studies. Indeed, IP considerations prevent us from releasing more data on the nature of the novel molecules that were discovered but we hope to do so with publication in a peer-reviewed journal in due time. Thanks for spotting the erroneous statements with respect to picaridin and ORs, we will correct them in a new version on BioRxiv.

In Figure 4, UniRep/BO is clearly superior to the other versions, whereas in Figure 5, even a random sequence performs well until higher iterations and there is never a clear difference between UniRep/BO and the other methods. You highlight that this task is very specific and is convex as explanations for why UniRep/BO is not clearly better, but I am still wondering why the performance for any method is not much better than random. Also, you also state that the sequence length is fixed at thirteen residues. In part A of the results, you mention that an advantage of BO is that the sequence length can change during optimization. Have you experimented with letting BO run with a variable length sequence on the unknown target matching problem? In addition, can you perform the AlphaFold task using the two ablated methods? I think including the ablation results for all three tasks would be helpful. I think Figure 1 could be made clearer if the sequences and labels proposed from the logits went directly to the train step, instead of being directed first to a separate shape. This would make Figure 1 have a more triangular structure, with the logits at the top, the UniRep vector in the bottom left, and the prediction plot in the bottom right.

The comments were synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. The study reports two two Bcl-2 family proteins, BNIP5 and Bcl-G, which inhibit Bak-dependent apoptosis through engagement of MODE 2 inhibition. The BH3 domains of these proteins act as selective Bak activators, while not inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins, leading to increased binding of activated Bak to Mcl-1, which prevents apoptosis. The reviewers raised a couple of questions about the methodology and several other suggestions for the paper, outlined below: Methodology Throughout the study various BH3 mimetics are used, but the combinations in which they are used and/or the doses employed could be more clearly reported. For example, in Figure 1E and 1F ABT-737 and S63845 are used at 1 μM.  Then, in Figure 1H, A-331852 is substituted for ABT-737 in combination with S63845 and the concentration is not reported. In Figure 1H, ABT-737 and S63845 are used again, but this time at a concentration of 2 μM each. Other concentrations are used  in Figures 2, 3, and 5.  There seems to be a dose-response assay in Figure 3B, but it is used for a specific use case. It would be beneficial to report all combinations and doses employed, and the rationale for them in the main text, to allow readers to fully interpret the data presented. In various figures, there is a concern about the statistical approach to calculate p-values based on multiple measurements or cells within each sample. The t-test and ANOVA assume that each measurement is independent, and multiple nuclei within the same sample are not independent. Recommend either not reporting p-values or averaging together the values from each biological replicate to calculate the p-value using those sample-level means. For more information, see https://doi.org/10.1371/jou... and https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb... Specific comments Introduction ‘ The two MOMP effectors Bcl-2 associated x (Bax) and Bcl-2 antagonist killer (Bak) are inactive in resting cells as these cells exhibit low levels of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (e.g. BIM)....and some are additionally able to activate Bax and Bak (sensitizers and direct activators, e.g. BIM)’ - Recommend revising the fragment for clarity, adding references to support the statements and possibly an introductory figure to help visualize the proteins involved. Introduction, last paragraph ‘ We found that two Bcl-2 proteins, Bcl-2 interacting protein 5 (BNIP5) and Bcl-G, act as selective inhibitors of Bak-dependent but not Bax-dependent apoptosis…’ - The fragment is unclear, BNIP5 and Bcl-G are first reported as Bak-inhibitors, then activators and back to inhibitors. Does this mean to describe protein-protein interaction and changes in conformation? Figure 1 - Recommend using a different color scheme for Figure 1E to assist visual interpretation of the results, in particular consider using a color-blind friendly color palette. - ‘ colony formation (F)’ - The text later on refers to ‘clonogenic survival’, would it be possible to clarify in the legend or text what is being assessed, i.e. recovery assay, clonogenic survival or colony formation? - Figure 1G - Please clarify whether 2 uM of each are used in this experiment. - ‘ We transduced PC9 lung cancer or A375 melanoma cells…’ - It is nice to see that different cell lines were assessed to address any cell line-specific effects. Would be interesting to see if this effect occurs in normal cell lines and not just cancer cell lines. Figure 2 -  The inline color-coded legends are useful when bars are displayed but in the figure several bars are close to zero, consider an alternative method to label the bars. Results ‘...suggesting posttranscriptional regulation of Bak levels by BNIP5 ’ - Maybe large proteome databases of multiple cell lines (e.g CCLE) can be datamined to determine the correlation between BNIP and Bak expression? Figure 3B, 3D and 3E - Please clarify the concentrations used for each treatment in the figure legend. Methods, Cell viability and cell death measurements - The study assessed cell death or cell viability with either live cell imaging, or in fixed cells, can the methodology for this be elaborated upon? Also, propidium iodide staining is used in several sections of the results, recommend adding information about this under the Methods section. Methods - There are several missing references in the Methods section. Suggest adding Supplemental Figure 6 as a graphical abstract.",2022-09-15T07:03:40,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2022.07.24.499430,Anti-apoptotic BH3-only proteins inhibit Bak-dependent apoptosis,"Sebastian Ruehl, Clifford S.
