This task also provides a good benchmark of pLM quality, since pLMs with ‘better’ embedded representations of sequences produce better variant scores/suggestions. See, for example, Zhou et al 2024 (Enhancing efficiency of protein language models with minimal wet-lab data through few-shot learning), and Jiang et al 2024 (Rapid protein evolution by few-shot learning with a protein language model).

Not sure where to discuss after the paper was published, but wanted to add some insight regarding the endogenously purified Pks13 protein used for cryoEM, crosslinking mass spec, and LC-MS (for identification of endogenous lipid). As it's published at NSMB, the paper doesn't address the fact that the endogenously purified Pks13 used for the above mentioned experiments, using the same purification protocol each time, showed variable SEC traces. After a while, we could not reproduce the peak1 and peak2 peaks in SEC (shown in Extended data fig1), but the two peaks either overlapped, or peak1 essentially disappeared. Sometimes, other interacting proteins were also pulled down along with Pks13, which confounded the SEC traces. CryoEM was done with peak1 with TAM inhibitor added, while XL-MS and LC-MS were done with mixed peak1&2 species. Protein used for XL-MS also had ""contaminant"" species which could actually be functionally-relevant binding partner. Since these protein preps behaved differently in SEC, we are not sure about the functional ramifications of these proteins purified at different times. If others are trying to reproduce our purification results, they may come across these variabilities (which is reasonable, given that this is an endogenous purification!).",2024-09-26T01:06:46,disqus_8H1VQv6qkX,Kate,10.1101/2023.01.27.525930,Structure and dynamics of the essential endogenous mycobacterial polyketide synthase Pks13,"Sun Kyung Kim, Miles Sasha Dickinson, Janet Finer-Moore, Ziqiang Guan, Robyn M.

However, having a major conclusion and an implication that Mac1 inhibitors are not antiviral based solely on negative data is misleading. We have published that a macrodomain inhibitor can inhibit virus replication (PMID: 38592023) and will have another story that will soon be available in BioRxiv that describes even more Mac1 targeting compounds that inhibit virus replication. There are some notable problems with the compound described here that could explain its lack of antiviral activity that should be taken into account. Again, I think the novel chemistry identified in this paper is exceptional, but more cautiousness should be taken before making broad claims that this is not a good drug target. Based on genetic data Mac1 and another recent paper on bioRxiv ( https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.08.606661), it appears that Mac1 is a suitable target for antiviral development, and we are continuing to work to see that dream come to fruition.",2024-09-24T16:44:20,thefehrlab,The Fehr Lab,10.1101/2024.08.19.608619,Discovery of potent SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 macrodomain inhibitors uncovers lack of translation to cellular antiviral response,"Alpha A.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.19.572389v1#comment-6556038787,biorxivstage,1,"Response from Andrew Savinov, Sebastian Swanson, Amy E. Keating, and Gene-Wei Li (MIT): We thank CJ San Felipe, Priyanka Bajaj, and James Fraser for their thoughtful review of our manuscript, “High-throughput computational discovery of inhibitory protein fragments with AlphaFold” ( bioRxiv 2023.12.19.572389). We were pleased the reviewers appreciated our contributions in predicting protein fragment binding modes. The major point the reviewers raise is uncertainty about how MSAs were treated in making the FragFold predictions. We now address this and several other points alongside extensive additions to this paper, including new high-throughput experimental data supporting the computationally predicted fragment binding models. Here we summarize our responses and changes in this revised manuscript, now available as Version 2 on bioRxiv . Throughout, we use bold text blocks to indicate our responses, and italic text blocks to indicate reviewer comments. From introductory comments and reviewers’ major point 1: The major strength of this paper is in developing a method that could be used to identify regions of proteins that are involved in PPI's based on evolutionarily related sequences that recapitulate the native binding interfaces. The major weakness of this paper is that the underlying method of MSA concatenation is not clearly explained (see Major point 1). Why is the discontinuous unpaired strategy optimal relative to other AlphaFold-multimer-like strategies? Overall, the paper demonstrates the power of AlphaFold to closely recapitulate the structures of experimentally determined fragment binding interfaces by working exclusively in sequence space in a high-throughput manner. Further, in the absence of experimental structures, the authors present plausible AlphaFold predictions of fragment bound structures that are supported by biochemical and genetic data which could further contribute to the utility of this method in studying known PPI's. Major points: 1) The authors state that they generated multiple sequence alignments for both the fragments and target protein prior to running AlphaFold2 to minimize computation time. Although it is not clearly explained, the authors claim they concatenated these two MSA's into a single MSA. We interpret this to mean that the input MSA's were not directly pairing the fragment sequences to the target sequences but leaving either side of the fragment sequence and the target sequence blank to force AlphaFold to co-predict the structure of the fragment with the target protein by treating it as a single discontinuous sequence. While we were surprised by the simplicity of this method and the ability to remain in sequence space based on evolutionary similarity of fragment and target protein sequences, there are several questions we have regarding this implementation From the explanation provided with figure 1A, the fragment sequence appears to be directly paired to the target sequence, however in fig 1B the method appears to work by using the evolutionary information of many orthologs and related proteins of both fragment and target to co-predict their structures using a discontinuous input sequence. Is this correct? Could the authors provide a clearer description of how they are concatenating the MSA's? We were also curious to know how different concatenation strategies affect the accuracy of predictions. For example, could the authors also try concatenating directly paired fragment-target sequences from the same species of origin (or even try this as a single continuous sequence)? If the sequences are continuous, does adding linker regions between the fragment and target alter the results? Does the order of concatenation affect the results (concatenating from the N or C-termini of the target?). We thank the reviewers for pointing out this potential point of confusion in our methodology. We have now revised the description of our methods in the Results, Figure 1, and the Materials and Methods to clarify what was done. No novel methods of MSA concatenation were developed in this work. Rather, protein-peptide binding predictions were run using the established approach natively implemented in the ColabFold version of AlphaFold2, in which multiple polypeptides are explicitly modeled as separate chains (Mirdita et al. , Nature Methods 2022). Likewise, multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of the separate protein partners (i.e., fragment and target protein) were concatenated, a standard input for ColabFold required for predicting interactions between multiple polypeptide chains. MSAs were concatenated in a strictly row-wise, unpaired fashion. Crucially, we note that while the MSAs are concatenated (as required by ColabFold), the sequences of the protein fragment and full-length protein polypeptide chains are distinct and not connected. The strictly row-wise concatenation performed here means that in principle the order of concatenation should not matter for these predictions. We do not claim in this work that unpaired MSAs necessarily have better performance than paired MSAs (which we did not test). Rather, we deliberately used unpaired MSAs to avoid co-evolutionary signals of full-length protein-protein interactions being used in the prediction of protein-fragment interactions. As we report in the manuscript, we find that the performance with unpaired MSAs and multiple chains modeled in AlphaFold2 with monomer weights is very good, with protein-fragment interactions predicted well without the model having been trained on multi-protein complexes (only single chains) and not using multi-chain MSA pairing. All of the above clarifications have now been added to the revised manuscript. 2) In Figure 2A, the peaks indicating inhibitory activity correlate positively with the observed peaks in calculated weighted N_contacts, which forms the basis for all inferences. However, the data reveals an interesting observation in the initial segment of the protein fragment (0 to 100 aa) that while there is a peak indicating predicted binding by the AlphaFold model, there is no corresponding inhibitory activity observed for the protein in that region. Any comments on this discrepancy? In the revised manuscript, we now discuss the predicted fragment binding peak centered around residue 60 of FtsZ, which lacks corresponding inhibitory activity in our high-throughput in vivo experiments. As we describe, this region maps to a region of the protein involved in filament formation and predicted to bind in a native-like manner by FragFold. However, this same region of the full-length protein was found to exhibit a high B-factor in previous crystallographic characterization of the binding interface, suggesting it contributes little to the binding energy (Schumacher et al. , Acta Cryst F 2020). We therefore note that this example peak represents a case of a plausible predicted binder which does not inhibit the parental full-length protein interaction. 3) The authors introduce (f_native,pairwise) and (f_native,binding) to quantify similarities between experimentally solved structures and AlphaFold2 models. We found the explanation of these metrics to be confusing, one refers to the fragment and the target site but the other refers to the native binding site bound by the fragment. Is one referring to the contacts made in the experimental structure and the other the contacts in the AlphaFold model? Further clarification of what these precisely correspond to would be helpful for discerning the similarities and differences between the two. Thanks to the reviewers for noting this opportunity to provide increased clarity. In the revised manuscript, we now clarify these terms at the time they are introduced. (These terms reflect, respectively, the fraction of pairwise fragment-protein contacts from experimental full-length (native) protein-protein interaction structures predicted by FragFold; and the fraction of target protein residues from the native, experimentally determined interaction mode predicted by FragFold to be bound by any fragment residue.) 4) In both figures 2 and 3 the authors show structures of the experimentally solved complexes and the predicted AlphaFold models side by side. We were curious to know whether the AlphaFold models were able to recapitulate the sidechain conformations. In addition we were also curious to know whether the AlphaFold model recapitulated any key contacts made between the binding site and the fragment (ex: salt bridges, electrostatic interactions between charged amino acids, pi-pi stacks, hydrogen bonds between sidechains). A full investigation of the quality of sidechain conformation predictions made by AlphaFold is beyond the scope of this work and has been previously considered by others (e.g., Karelina, Noh, and Dror, eLife 2023; Jumper et al. , Nature 2021). In prior work the root-mean squared deviation (RMSD) of all non-hydrogen atoms (including sidechains) between experimental structures and AlphaFold2 models was generally found to be low (e.g., median RMSD of 2.9 Å; Karelina, Noh, and Dror, eLife 2023) but not necessarily sufficient for docking small molecules as well as enabled by experimental structures. Although sidechain conformations were not a focus of our study – and we do not compare in detail between predicted and native structures – we do now provide several predicted protein-fragment binding mode structures including sidechains, comparing FragFold models to FragFold models relaxed with the Rosetta energy function (see new Figure S8). We find that in the predicted structures, details including sidechain orientations and hydrogen bonding patterns at interfaces tend not to change substantially upon Rosetta relaxation,  suggesting that the predicted binding modes are physically and biochemically reasonable (see also the section on further additions to the manuscript, below). 5) The authors explain their use of tiling to generate inhibitory fragments and that overlapping fragments generate greater predicted binding peaks. Have the authors attempted to use smaller fragments in their program (i.e. what is the smallest fragment size that AlphaFold can still predict to be correctly binding?). We are curious to know if effects vary by changing the fragment sizes. Further, can this method be expanded upon to study multiple different fragments that bind to different sites on the target protein simultaneously? We thank the reviewers for raising these interesting ideas. Here the reviewers point out several directions we are excited to pursue in future studies but that are outside of the scope of the current work. We focused on 30-amino acid fragments for all proteins except for LptG, because based on experimental data (Savinov, Swanson, and Fields, PNAS 2022) this fragment length tended to give the best signal-to-noise and specificity of inhibitory effects in these experiments. That said, for the case of LptG, both the experimental data and our FragFold predictions reported in this manuscript were for fragments of 14 amino acids, and we were successful in predicting inhibitory peaks at this fragment length. This result illustrates that the binding modes of fragments as short as 14 amino acids are capable of being predicted by FragFold, and we too are curious how far this finding generalizes, and whether even shorter fragments will still yield comparable results. The reviewers also raise an interesting idea regarding modeling multiple binding fragments simultaneously. While our goals in this work were to model single fragments, allowing direct comparison to our high-throughput experimental data in cells (where each cell expresses a single protein fragment), in the future modeling multiple fragments should allow prediction of synergistic inhibitors, which is a promising direction for designing superior inhibitory peptides, e.g., with multiple binding fragments connected by peptide linkers. Minor points: 1) The orange and yellow lines used to show contacts between the fragment and target are difficult to distinguish from each other. Consider a different set of colors? 2) Figure 4C+E. The use of black in the model makes it difficult to distinguish the sidechains and interactions with the fragment. We believe both of these issues were related to lower-resolution figures in the initial bioRxiv submission. The revised manuscript both includes higher-resolution figures, and in several cases larger figures, allowing for small details including contact lines and sidechain interactions to come through more clearly. A brief summary of further additions to the revised manuscript: In addition to our responses to the comments from San Felipe, Bajaj, and Fraser as summarized above, we herein provide a brief highlight of other changes and additions to the revised manuscript: •	We now include extensive experimental deep mutational scanning (DMS) data on several inhibitory protein fragments. These data reveal mutations that yield further improved inhibitory protein fragments, with implications for designing peptide-based therapeutics. The DMS data also provide systematic experimental support for the FragFold-predicted fragment binding modes, including for the novel binding modes predicted for the C-terminal fragment of FtsZ. •	We perform an analysis of predicted fragment binding energy with Rosetta to show that the predicted fragment binding modes are physically plausible and broadly consistent with those seen for known peptide binders with experimentally-determined structures. Furthermore, relaxation of FragFold predicted structures using the Rosetta force field does not substantially change the binding conformations or binding energies, suggesting the binding modes directly predicted by AlphaFold are reasonable without further adjustment. •	We perform additional extensive FragFold predictions against non-cognate protein partners to further demonstrate prediction specificity. •	We compare the performance of FragFold with an alternative approach, the Rosetta-based Peptiderive protocol.",2024-09-23T18:54:22,andrew_savinov,Andrew Savinov,10.1101/2023.12.19.572389,High-throughput computational discovery of inhibitory protein fragments with AlphaFold,"Andrew Savinov, Sebastian Swanson, Amy E.

The central premise of the paper is to use a yeast selection based around the oligmerizaton/aggregation of Sup35 fused to a peptide (in this case abeta) as a proxy for amyloid forming potential. This is cool information on its own and the experimental analysis and computational framework for linking to energies is top notch. The point of using double mutants to enhance the dynamic range is very well explained and will solidify their approach to impactfully link DMS experiments to thermodynamic concepts. The major framing of the paper revolves around an analytical protein folding/engineering concept of phi-values that highlights energetic differences in the importance of interactions for forming the transition state vs. the ground state. For the textual interpretation of the results, one must buy into the energetic effects of the Sup35 system as a readout of the transition state (and secondarily for FoldX calculations on various PDBs of abeta polymorphs to be a readout of the ground state). The major issue is that an alternative (and perhaps simpler) explanation is that mutations in APR2 are more disruptive to the Sup35 oligomerization process in the screen and that this reflects amyloid/oligomerization propensities and not strictly TS of initial nucleation. The data from previous studies that is used to draw correlations to justify their interpretation around the TS is buried in extended data figures and is a bit all over the place, especially the deconvolution of primary vs. secondary nucleation. The existence of multiple polymorphs in human cells (and populations), which may or may not have related transition states - and the exact conformational requirements of the Sup35 activation mechanism - further complicate this interpretation. In summary - this contains amazing data, but I do not see the language of the interpretations lining up with the strength of the _specificity_ of the claims about the transition state.  A fuller discussion of the limitations of the prior low throughput assays that are referenced in extended data 1 and 2 and detailed kinetic characterization of some of the more surprising mutants in a biochemically defined system would greatly improve the match between the data and the claims. These issues should not stop others from building on this beautiful work - but in doing so, other investigators should note that there remains ambiguity as to whether the effects are truly on the TS or on the ground state.

This is not true, so it's appropriate to respond here. Both commenters note that low p-values for relative risk maps (Figure 2 and Figure 4) require sufficient sampling density to obtain a low p-value. Of course, this is correct. Both commenters argue that this is misleading. I disagree. No co-author, peer reviewer, or editor involved was misled. News articles on the paper thus far have almost all portrayed the data and analysis accurately. We do not argue in the paper that SARS-CoV-2 could not have been found in places that were not sampled; I'm unaware of anyone making this argument based on our paper; it's not misleading if no one is misled. On top of this, the proportion of positive samples in each location is displayed along with the relative risk p-value. The n=1/1 sample that Bahry complains ""shows little heat"" is clearly indicated as a sampled location with high positivity in Fig 2A. And the underlying data is available in supplementary figures and tables. It's demonstratively not misleading. The other arguments the two commenters make consist of (1) arguing against a different paper published years ago, (2) a demand for a citation of an irrelevant paper, (3) arguing for an alternative analysis method without demonstrating that it would have more statistical power, (4) an argument that implicitly assumes all expectations for all coronaviruses are identical regardless of their hosts and modes of transmission, and lastly (5) a typo in a citation. We addressed the last one -- showing that, in fact, we didn't ignore these comments.",2024-09-21T04:17:05,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,10.1101/2023.09.13.557637,Genetic tracing of market wildlife and viruses at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Alexander Crits-Christoph, Joshua I.

Approaches like this applied to GWAS variants enable the implication of processes or pathways potentially mediating the genetic effects on complex phenotypes even in the absence of co-localizing cis-eQTL signals, which is unfortunately typical of GWAS signals. This pre-print does not include a Discussion section, so it does not yet sufficiently place this work in the context of the relevant published literature. When this is done, I would recommend consideration of our work on expression regulator activity QTLs (aQTLs) that was published in PLOS Computational Biology a few years ago ( Hoskins et al., 2021). Our two approaches share a lot conceptually in that we both assume that shared variability among genes often reflects a common underlying regulatory mechanism and that multidimensional reduction of the expression information among such genes can provide a useful metric for summarizing the activity of the gene set. The approach in this pre-print is generalizable for use with any type of gene set deemed potentially relevant to the GWAS trait of interest, while our approach in Hoskins et al. (2021) is more tailored to gene sets representing the target genes of expression regulators based on tissue or cell type-specific co-expression networks where the activity scores are inferred using the VIPER algorithm developed by Andrea Califano’s group (Alvarez et al., 2016). There are also some analyses, results, and speculations in our paper that might suggest potential additional considerations and investigations for this gsQTL study.",2024-09-18T21:12:56,disqus_2x4mJzljwV,Jason Hoskins,10.1101/2024.09.13.612853,gsQTL: Associating genetic risk variants with gene sets by exploiting their shared variability,"Gerard A.

This haplogroup is rare in Iberia but more commonly associated with Ashkenazi Jewish populations and Central Asia."" Were there any sources used for this statement? As far as I know, Jewish clades under Q are typically not Q1b1a3a1/Q-L332 (clades under Q-L245 are more typical). Q-L332 is a Y-chromosome haplogroup found in several bronze age Siberian populations, and is a fairly prominent lineage across Scythian populations during the iron age and antiquity (hence my interest in the remark above). Given the history of the Iberian peninsula, would it not be more plausible to attribute such lineages to the Alans? Sarmatians carried Y-chromosome haplogroup Q-L332, and there seem to be a decent amount of Spaniards and Portuguese which carry Sarmatian-related lineages to this day. Perhaps the R1a-Z94 lineage could also be there through Sarmatians but it would depend on the subclade, as R-Z94 is over 4000 years old and was carried by various peoples - mostly of Indo-Iranian origin however. If there were any sources used regarding the Jewish origin of Q-L332 in the Iberian peninsula or perhaps archaeological signs which affirm the Jewish origin of sample PT_23227, I would be interested to have a look.

Obviously there are informative samples in the world that weren't sequenced and there is sequencing data that hasn't been published. An identity vs sampling date plot would be limited to samples that were later published and would be out of date in a couple months. More importantly, I don't see any value in the impossible counterfactual of what we would know if sequences that were eventually published had instead been instantaneously sequenced and published on their sampling date. Of course, the answer is: ""we would know what we knew eventually, but earlier."" But that's also the answer if sampling followed by sequencing and publication was more frequent regardless of the rates of the different steps. Figure 2 in this paper clearly shows the value of adding data, especially before the spotlight shines on a virus like it did in 2020 and triggers sequencing of retrospective samples. This is important, because several of the data points in Figure 2 correspond to samples that have had the scientists who collected and sequenced samples and published the sequences targeted with conspiracy theories. This disincentivizes rapid publication of data. For example, the mid-2021 data point for RaTG15 prompted a letter to one of the authors of the corresponding publication with a weirdly inaccurate argument that an early-2020 data point for RaTG13 is inauthentic. The letter says ""it has not been possible to assemble the RaTG13 genome sequence"" while linking to a Virological.org post in which everyone who tries succeeds at assembling the RaTG13 genome sequence.

There has been an ongoing debate over whether DJ-1 acts directly on MG (direct substrate) or requires a protein intermediate acting as a protein/nucleic acid deglycase (glycated protein substrate). The authors used fixed-target micro-crystallography and mix-and-inject serial crystallography to structurally analyze covalent intermediates in the reaction catalyzed by DJ-1. One of the significant achievements of the study is the successful use of these advanced crystallography methods to determine the structure of key reaction intermediates: hemithioacetal and L-lactoylcysteine, providing new insights into DJ-1's glyoxalase mechanism. However, a major weakness is that the authors' claim refuting the alternative deglycase mechanism are not fully supported by the presented data. Despite this limitation, the study advances our understanding of DJ-1’s enzymatic function by leveraging MISC at synchrotron using the new flow cell injector. Major points Major point 1 The claim made in the discussion that: “These results provide direct structural evidence supporting a growing number of enzymology studies also indicating that DJ-1 is not a deglycase…” is not supported by evidence presented in the manuscript. Although this work elegantly demonstrates that MG covalently modifies the catalytic cysteine of DJ-1 (Cys106), the crystallography experiments presented are unable to test whether the alternative mechanism (with a glycated substrate) occurs. More careful treatment of this logic in the discussion would strengthen the manuscript, and would help the manuscript to be more focused on the compelling X-ray crystallography results. We recognize it is difficult to “prove a negative” however these experiments affirm the primary activity without directly testing the alternative one. Major point 2 The authors report compelling evidence that the DJ-1 catalytic cysteine (Cys106) is covalently modified by MG. However, the concentration of MG used was 50 mM, and non-catalytic cysteines might be covalently modified at this concentration. Indeed, it’s possible that one of the DJ-1 surface cysteines is covalently modified (Cys53), based on the large positive difference peak in the FO-FO difference density (Figure 5b, Figure S8) (although it is suggested that this is evidence of allosteric communication). Covalent modification of a surface cysteine leading to lattice disruption is consistent with the observation that MG is known to dissolve DJ-1 crystals. The manuscript could be strengthened by consideration of these points, as well as analysis of difference maps around Cys53 for the fixed target structure (e.g. add panel to Figure S1 showing FO(methylglyoxal)-FO(free) maps around Cys53). Discussion of the differences in modification rates for the catalytic and surface cysteines, and the impact of large versus small crystals, would be helpful. Major point 3 Is it plausible that a second, synchronized turnover is captured by the mix-and-inject experiment? This claim might be developed by modeling the concentration profile of the intermediates along the 30 second time course (e.g. similar to Figure 4 in PMID 29848358). To this point, were the occupancies of the covalent adducts refined at each time point? Did the authors consider whether a mixture of species might be present? The evidence supporting the second turnover comes from the featureless difference map calculated between the 3 sec and 20 sec time points (FO(20s)-FO(3s) in Figure S6). Is there an alternative explanation for the decreased occupancy at this time point other than synchronized turnover? E.g. a problem with sample mixing resulting in lower substrate concentration at this time point. A related concern is whether the data as presented can discriminate between the two covalent intermediates (HTA or LC). Perhaps Figure S7 would be strengthened by adding the FO-FC difference maps for each of the intermediates modeled with the other species (e.g. the HTA dataset modeled with LC and vice versa). Can the authors comment on the lack of correlated negative (or positive) density in the FO-FO difference map matrix (Figure S5) in panels comparing sp2 and sp3 carbons (e.g. FO(15s)-FO(3s)). In this example, there is a large positive peak in the difference map for the sp2 to sp3 change, but no correlated negative peak. Minor points Minor point 1 Was the covalent adduct observed in the MG-soaked DJ-1 crystals presented in Figure S1c modeled? Is the difference density consistent with the HTA or LC intermediates? Or a mixture of both? Minor point 2 Is it possible that movement of the active site histidine (His126) away from covalent intermediate (Figure 4a) is consistent with histidine protonation? Or is the geometry such that protonation is unlikely? Minor point 3 We find it helpful if the figure (or figure legend) includes PDB codes for their quick look up. Minor point 4 The size of the scale bar in Figure S1a might be increased. Review by: Pooja Asthana, Galen J. Correy & James S.

In the Result subchapter titled “Gentle antibody stripping is necessary for sequential immunostaining with scores of iterations” at line 171 and following you mention several potential Ab stripping reagents, which are not further detailed in the M&M section. Furthermore, you mention beta-ME (line 173) and a low Ph buffer (line 175) as two separate stripping solutions. In the text, there is only one proprietary buffer, IRISKit® HyperView Advanced Ab Stripping Kit , for which a webpage in chinese can be found ( http://m.luminiris.cn/pd.jsp?pid=14) and no information on the composition can be obtained, neither you provide in the manuscript. To my knowledge, there is no mention in the scientific peer-reviewed literature of beta-ME ALONE as a stripping buffer. Besides the inventor of the 2-ME containing buffer, Laemmli (Nature. 1970;227:680–685), the earliest mention of beta-ME for stripping is Pirici (doi: 10.1369/jhc.2009.953240), after which we did quite some experiments (doi: 10.1369/0022155414536732; doi: 10.1097/pai.0000000000000203; doi: 10.1369/0022155417719419, this latter viewed 23,855 times and quoted in 101 papers). None of these references are among the one you quote. For reproducibility and to avoid re-inventing the wheel for one’s own advantage, you may wish to quote the relevant previous art and provide evidence of any modification or improvement. If the solution is proprietary, full disclosure is require or mention that the content of the proprietary solution is unknown. I do appreciate the effort put in the manuscript, which clearly appears an immature draft.

The results in this paper, even without a glutamine inhibitor, would disagree with that statement.  Maybe you can mention the conflicting approaches to ketogenic diet in the discussion? 2. Have you looked into the work of Mukherjee et al? They report a very similar effect with ketogenic diet and DON in late stage experimental glioblastoma. Perhaps this intervention could be a more universal therapy? Thank you for this very promising work exploring diet-drug combinations!",2024-08-22T15:51:55,disqus_1jzc3WrtO7,Jack M,10.1101/2024.07.19.604377,A Ketogenic Diet Sensitizes Pancreatic Cancer to Inhibition of Glutamine Metabolism,"Omid Hajihassani, Mehrdad Zarei, Asael Roichman, Alexander Loftus, Christina S.
