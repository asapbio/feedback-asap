These are very relevant questions. SPLIT builds on deconvolution results (we used RCTD in the manuscript), but importantly, it does not invent cell types or force structure into the data. If a reference cell type is not present in the spatial data, this is typically not an issue. Its weights should remain ~0, and SPLIT will not over-correct or create artificial clusters. If a spatial cell type is missing from the reference, several scenarios are possible: 1. It may be assigned to the closest available reference type. 2. It may be represented as a mixture of available types (see Supplementary Fig. 10). In such cases, applying SPLIT may shift the expression profile toward the primary assigned type. To address this, SPLIT provides a spatially aware mode, which evaluates whether contamination from secondary cell types is spatially plausible before correcting (see the spatially aware option on GitHub). This helps prevent overcorrection. 3. Cells of this missing type may receive low-confidence annotation scores. By default, SPLIT does not purify low-confidence annotated cells. Thanks again for the thoughtful questions!

The apparent discrepancy arises because, in OCP holoproteins, the extinction coefficient at 280 nm cannot be attributed solely to the protein component. The carotenoid chromophore also exhibits significant absorption in the UV region, including at 280 nm; therefore, the A280/A476 ratio differs from that expected for the apoprotein alone. Although the exact extinction coefficient of the carotenoid within the protein at 280 nm is not precisely known, its contribution increases the absorbance at 280 nm and affects the apparent relationship between protein concentration and the absorption at 476 nm. When this contribution is taken into account, the measured absorbance values are consistent with a predominantly holoprotein sample rather than a ~50% apo/holoprotein mixture.",2026-02-20T03:05:27,disqus_jj16kVvFXW,YN,10.1101/2025.05.26.656073,Kinetic Insights into Photoinduced Monomer–Dimer Conversion and Activation of Orange Carotenoid Protein,"Tadayuki Tokashiki, Takatoshi Ohata, Shunrou Tokonami, Takashi Oda, Yusuke Nakasone, Masahide Terazima",2025-05-30

Let me start by saying I appreciate both the effort given to address this sanitary crisis and the concern for the affected farming communities. In short, I think several core structural assumptions are influencing model results (specifically regarding the omission of vector dynamics, lack of detection uncertainty, and simplified contact structure), and I am concerned that the appearance of equivalence between mass and selective culling strategies is artefactual to these assumptions. Given the sensitivity of the current policy debate, I felt it important to provide a structured critique that goes into these issues in detail.

Your paper was overall clear and concise. Just a few notes: Figure 1: I'm a little confused why you decided to show log insulin levels for Figure 1A, but then showed insulin levels in quartiles for Figure 1B. It makes it a little difficult to compare the two figures. Figure 2: I think how you decided to show statistical significance between groups in Figure 2B was a little confusing. The colors used for the significance bars are similar to some of the colors used to differentiate the genotype and diet groups. It may be beneficial to use different colors for the significance bars to make it clearer which groups are significantly different. Also, with the way the bars are formatted, it looks like it was determined that body mass significantly increased over time, but as I understood it, you didn't test for that. If I'm reading it correctly, then you used bars to show at what time point significant differences began. It may be beneficial to clarify this and make the graph larger so it's easier to interpret. I'm also a little confused about why you combined data from facilities A and B in Figure 2, but not in the other figures. It may be better to show the data shown in Supplemental Figure 1 in Figure 2.

We already showed in 2013 that Abs induce persistence by converting the whole population into persister cells without inducing death by pre-treating with rifampicin, tet, and CCCP (doi:10.1128/AAC.02135-12) so please add this to your paper. We vetted these persister cells 9 ways to show they are true persisters in later publication. This method has been used by over 60 groups to date in the persister field. Response: Thanks for pointing out. We totally agree that bacteriostatic antibiotics and drugs, by definition, can convert most of a bacterial population into persister cells without inducing death. Therefore, in this study we focus on bactericidal antibiotics, mostly used in time-kill assays, to examine and quantify persisters induced by lethal stresses. Broadly, your work agrees with our proposed drug-induced persistence spectrum (DIPS) model and a more general stress-induced-persistence-spectrum model. Your work will acknowledged in the Discussion. 2.	We were the first to show, using single cells, in 2018 (doi:10.1111/1462-2920.14093) that persister cells wake in minutes. Please update your line 85 text which is false as, we have shown and other groups corroborated, nearly all persister cells resuscitate within minutes of being introduced into fresh medium so they wake and multiply at the same growth rate of exponentially-growing cells within seconds. Response: Thank you for this clarification. We agree that most persister cells, once they wake, rapidly resume normal growth and proliferate at rates comparable to susceptible cells. Only a minority remain in a dormant state and constitute the pre-existing persisters, which are the persisters referred to in this context (line 85). We would like to clarify that “persister replication” in line 85 refers specifically to the rare events in which a persister cell divides to produce two persister cells, rather than to persister resuscitation and growth. We believe such events are rare and negligible relative to the contribution of pre-existing persisters. 3.	There is no credible evidence for ‘spontaneous’ persisters, only sloppy carryover from the inoculum. Response: Thank you for this comment. We agree that the vast majority of persisters, found in exponential-phase culture, originate from stationary-phase inocula and that carryover can contribute substantially to observed persister populations (when seed dilution factors are low, e.g, 100x). At the same time, we note that the existence of truly spontaneous persisters remains a theoretical possibility and has been suggested by several single-cell studies, although this remains a subject of debate. Such spontaneous persisters could arise from stochastic fluctuations or rare glitches in transcription, translation, metabolism, and/or asymmetric allocation during cell division, leading to unusual levels of ppGpp, toxins, or other effector proteins in a small subset of cells. If such events occur, we expect them to occur at extremely low frequencies. 4. Please replace your ref 23 single cell work of Van Melderen as the first single cell work.  the same conclusions was https://doi.org/10.1016/ j.isci.2019.100792 and doi:10.1111/1462-2920.14093.

The authors undertook a variety of different experiments, which was impressive, but also may have lessened the quality of their research. While much of the science appeared to be quite convincing, a closer look reveals some inconsistencies between stated findings and figures. I noticed many typos within the legends on the figures, and differences in the experimental process described in words versus the experimental process reflected by figures. Some things to take note of: in Figure 1, procedures are not clear; when were the measurements taken? Was the glucose checked in the mice? What is the ""endpoint"" for the experiment, and why does it change from experiment to experiment? Did the mice die or were they sacrificed? Survival curves would also have been appreciated. Furthermore, i believe it would benefit the research to have conducted studies on male and female mice for all conditions, to test for any changes between sex. In Figure 2, I noticed that different cancer cell lines were utilized in the experimental process, but no explanation was given for why this was the case. In Figure 3, many of the colors and shapes do not match across panels, which makes it difficult to track the data (ex. for E.coli). Similar to above, the data in Figure 3F does not match the analysis given in the ""results"" section. Figure 4 and 5 featured a bubble plot, which presented very informative data, however the paper seemed to focus on aspects of the heat map that were not necessarily proven by the data. For example, the passage states: “This analysis revealed a prominent activation of the tryptophan metabolic pathway in the MedDiet group” (260), but this is not necessarily proven by figure 4; the data shows that there seems to be other metabolic pathways that are upregulated by the MedDiet group than the Tryptophan metabolic pathway. It might be worth considering addressing this issue, to avoid introducing any accidental bias into the findings. Some other issues that were noticed: it was assumed that the reader had context for this study, but many readers may be coming in to read this paper with no background on the MedDiet. Many acronyms were used without providing appropriate definitions which made it difficult to follow the paper. It seemed as though the paper jumped to many conclusions without providing an accurate backing or ""proof"". Much of the statistical analyses used in this paper also seemed to be inconsistent. Some things that can be appreciated about this paper: the authors covered a lot of bases and tried to include many sample groups (different diets, cancer lines, mice sexes, etc.). I appreciate that they tested for reproducibility, at least at the beginning. They also tried to investigate the mechanism of the MedDiet, not just general effects. They also used a variety of different techniques to evaluate their hypothesis: flow cytometry, genomic sequencing, immunohistochemistry, etc. All things considered, this was a huge undertaking. I am sure that with further review, this could become quite beneficial for the scientific community.

We already showed in 2013 that Abs induce persistence by converting the whole population into persister cells without inducing death by pre-treating with rifampicin, tet, and CCCP (doi:10.1128/AAC.02135-12) so please add this to your paper. We vetted these persister cells 9 ways to show they are true persisters in later publication. This method has been used by over 60 groups to date in the persister field. 2. We were the first to show, using single cells, in 2018 (doi:10.1111/1462-2920.14093) that persister cells wake in minutes. Please update your line 85 text which is false as, we have shown and other groups corroborated, nearly all persister cells resuscitate within minutes of being introduced into fresh medium so they wake and multiply at the same growth rate of exponentially-growing cells within seconds. 3.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has achieved substantial success in hematological malignancies but remains largely ineffective in solid tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this preprint, the authors address this important challenge by examining how obesity alters the tumor microenvironment (TME) to limit CAR-T cell efficacy, with a focus on the inhibitory checkpoint molecule B7-H3. The experimental rationale is well-conceived, and the development of a CAR-T platform targeting a checkpoint pathway relevant to TNBC is innovative and timely. The study provides valuable insight into the interaction between host metabolic state and immunotherapy outcomes. However, some aspects of the experimental design, data analysis, and interpretation require further clarification to strengthen the study's impact and significance. A major assumption in Figure 1 is that obesity-associated inflammatory cytokines promote B7-H3 expression in TNBC. Based on this, the authors focus primarily on IFN-γ and TNF as mediators of this effect. While both cytokines are established regulators of immune checkpoint pathways, it is unclear whether their selection was informed by preliminary data demonstrating their elevation in the obesity-associated TNBC models used here. Obesity is a complex inflammatory milieu that includes not only pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory mediators such as IL-10 and TGF-β, which have also been implicated in immune suppression and checkpoint regulation within the TME. Background cytokine profiling or broader screening should be conducted to provide a strong justification for choosing specific cytokines. The experimental design presented in Figure 2 includes four biologically distinct groups: lean control and obese mice bearing either scramble or B7-H3–knockdown E0771 tumors. However, the analytical approach used relied on splitting these groups and performing multiple Student’s t-tests. A direct comparison across all groups using a one- or two-way ANOVA, as appropriate, is more statistically rigorous and better suited for this setting. The authors report differences in immune cell frequencies within the TME, which represents an important strength of the study. However, total frequencies were presented without gating strategies or phenotypic characterization. Assessment of tumor immune infiltration requires more detailed profiling because immune cell activation, exhaustion, or functionality can differ substantially even with similar total frequency. Including gating schematics and markers defining functional states would improve data interpretation and provide a better understanding of how obesity reshapes the immune landscape in TNBC. The authors did not assess changes in B7-H3 expression during tumor progression. Kinetic analysis of B7-H3 expression would help understand constitutive expression and changes driven by tumor growth, immune infiltration, or obesity. Such information could clarify whether obesity accelerates checkpoint upregulation during tumor progression. CAR-T cell cytotoxicity was inferred primarily from cytokine production (IL-2 and IFN-γ). Although these cytokines reflect T cell activation, they do not directly measure cytolytic activity. Degranulation assays assessing granzyme B, perforin, and CD107a expression would provide a direct and widely accepted measure of T cell cytotoxicity. An inconsistency is noted in the reported age of mice used in Figure 6. The text describes animals aged 25–30 weeks, but the schematic indicates 15 weeks. The strong influence of age on immune function and metabolic status necessitates consistency in animal age. This discrepancy should be corrected, and age should be clearly reported across all experiments. An interesting observation is that CAR-T cells generated from younger mice were able to reject tumors in both lean and obese hosts. In contrast, CAR-T cells from older mice failed to suppress tumor growth in DIO mice. This finding suggests an age-dependent decline in CAR-T cell functionality. However, this aspect is not fully explored. Additional discussion or mechanistic investigation of how donor age influences CAR-T fitness would substantially enhance the study's impact. Finally, the memory and recall experiments in Figure 7 raise important questions regarding differential survival after tumor rechallenge. The authors should report CAR-T cell persistence levels in lean and obese mice prior to rechallenge and provide tumor growth kinetics following rechallenge. Clarifying whether differences in survival are driven by primary tumor burden, metastatic dissemination, or immune memory failure would strengthen the interpretation of these results. Overall, this study addresses a timely and important question at the intersection of obesity, immune checkpoints, and CAR-T therapy in TNBC. The experimental rationale is strong, and the focus on B7-H3 as a mediator of immunotherapy resistance is well justified. Addressing the points outlined above would further strengthen the rigor, clarity, and translational relevance of the work. Also, this will help define how host metabolic state, age, and immune regulation collectively shape CAR-T efficacy in solid tumors.",2026-01-26T23:37:54,,Oladapo,10.1101/2025.10.10.681694,Obesity Impairs the Antitumor Activity of CAR-T Cells in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Hannah M.

Using variable concentrations of nocodazole to stabilise (low) or destabilise (high) MTs allows precise temporal control of spindle density/dynamics. However, it's a global change to the MTs and it's not clear what relative effect the Noc has on interpolar, kinetochore, centrosomal and augmin-mediated MTs. It would be interesting to know if these distinct populations are affected differentially and therefore what can be said about the relative contributions to spindle-chromosome rheology. In our previous work in Drosophila embryos (Hayward et la., Dev Cell 2014), we used an anti-Dgt6 antibody to specifically inactivate Augmin upon entry into mitosis (Augmin recruits the MT nucleator, g-TuRC to pre-existing spindle MTs increasing the overall density of the spindle ~2-fold). Augmin inhibition results in the dramatic loss of short spindle MTs, a reduction in spindle density and increase in pole-to-pole distance. Something we noted was that chromosome movement (as well as congression) was affected. Additionally, using a Rod-GFP fly line in the presence of Augmin inhibition, we saw all sorts of abnormal Rod-GFP movements along the kinetochore MTs that remained, suggesting something wrong with the forces between the kMT and the kinetochores. I think we talked a bit about this in the discussion - suggesting the abnormal congression was due to the rheology of the overall spindle being compromised by loss of the Augmin-generated (non-kinetochore) mass of short MTs.",2026-01-21T09:19:45,wakefieldjames,"Wakefield, James",10.64898/2026.01.17.700110,Coordinated chromosome motion emerges from mechanical coupling mediated by the physical spindle environment,"Jiali Zhu, Kerry Bloom, Ehssan Nazockdast, Paul Maddox",2026-01-20

Here are our highlights: Authors propose a ""theory-to-practice"" bridge for phylogeny: take a mathematically defined ""forest"" algorithm (that most biologists have never used) and then test it under simulation settings chosen to look biologically reasonable (Jukes-Cantor, short branches). The work deliberately departs from the standard paradigm of ""always returning a fully resolved tree"". The algorithm is optimized to avoid false splits and is allowed to output partial structures or abstain entirely. This places the method firmly in a precision-first regime rather than traditional phylogenetic benchmarking. The main onservation: the value of forest methods lies in explicitly identifying which parts of the data are informative and in providing downstream analyses with a more faithful representation of uncertainty. While the current approach outperforms NJ only in narrow regimes, the conceptual shift toward partial, conservative outputs (especially hybrid workflows that combine forests with standard tree-building methods) appears promising. The paper data are generated under a simple but biologically valid model, and the authors release the complete pipeline for data generation and experimentation.
