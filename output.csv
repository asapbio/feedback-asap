Malaria remains a major global health challenge, and understanding the biological rhythms of mosquito vectors and malarial parasites is crucial for improving control strategies. However, previous studies have only revealed that mosquitoes have daily rhythmic behaviors. You provided new insights. First, about half of the genes in the mosquito salivary gland transcriptome show 24-hour rhythmic expression, and second, the gene expression of sporozoites in the salivary glands also shows circadian rhythms (parasite movement and infection ability). In addition, you mentioned in the discussion that the parasites and mosquitoes have evolved in coordination with the circadian rhythms, and jointly affect host infection by regulating parasite movement and mosquito blood feeding time. This is very interesting, and your findings provide a new perspective for understanding the temporal regulation mechanism of malaria transmission. At the same time, you mentioned optimizing the insecticide spraying time strategy according to the peak period of mosquito activity. In addition, your findings may also have reference effects on other diseases. But I have some questions. First, it is good that you use 12h dark and 12h light to simulate day and night. But in the wild, the temperature and humidity vary between day and night. Perhaps the natural day-night cycle could be better simulated by changing temperature and humidity. Secondly, you mentioned that some observations may apply to uninfected mosquitoes, but you did not specifically discuss the potential differences in rhythms and behaviors between uninfected and infected mosquitoes. Finally, thank you again for your contribution and new ideas.",2024-10-18T18:57:00,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2024.05.14.594221,Circadian rhythms mediate malaria transmission potential,"Inês Bento, Brianna Parrington, Rushlenne Pascual, Alexander S Goldberg, Eileen Wang, Hani Liu, Mira Zelle, Joseph S Takahashi, Joshua E Elias, Maria M Mota, Filipa Rijo-Ferreira",2024-05-14

As one of the researchers with the most publications on CAV1 in Ewing Sarcoma (Oscar M. Tirado), I would like to offer some comments and suggestions for your consideration: It might be beneficial to mention that CAV1 is a demonstrated direct target of EWS::FLI1, as this could add further context to your findings. Regarding the presence of caveolae in Ewing Sarcoma cells, I assume you've reviewed the manuscript (DOI: 10.1016/j.canlet.2016.11.020). In most of the cells studied, including TC71, the levels of Cavin-1, as well as caveolae, are extremely low. As such, the majority of CAV1’s functions in EwS are likely independent of caveolae, which aligns with the results you’ve presented. I noticed the focus on the AKT pathway in your work. Have you considered discussing the MAPK pathway as well? It is also affected and likely plays a significant role in the processes you're describing. In Figure 4, CAV1 emerges as a potential driver, along with EphA2. I’m sure you are familiar with this study as well (DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31405), which may provide further insights. I agree with your assessment that CAV1 plays a key role in the progression of EwS, and your findings align with many of the conclusions we've drawn in our own research. I would be happy to assist further, either through this platform or via personal contact, as we've known each other for many years from various EwS meetings. Best regards, Oscar M. Tirado",2024-10-18T13:39:11,,Oscar,10.1101/2024.09.23.614468,Caveolin-1 regulates context-dependent signaling and survival in Ewing Sarcoma,"Dagan Segal, Xiaoyu Wang, Hanieh Mazloom-Farisbaf, Divya Rajendran, Erin Butler, Bingying Chen, Bo-Jui Chang, Khushi Ahuja, Averi Perny, Kushal Bhatt, Dana Kim Reed, Diego H.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.24.604258v2#comment-6572951909,biorxivstage,0,"Summary Here, the authors sought to apply cryo-EM guided metainterference-based MD simulations to find modeling inaccuracies of flexible helical regions linked to their artificial representation by a single-structure model. They first applied their approach to the group II intron ribozyme from Thermosynechococcus elongatus, one of a few cryo-EM structures available in the PDB that featured mostly RNA and was obtained using a single-structure refinement procedure. They confirmed that remodeling with their approach mostly affected flexible regions at the solvent-exposed stem loops that were not phylogenetically conserved. They found that functional domains that were well-ordered, phylogenetically conserved, and were clearly represented by the cryo-EM density required no remodeling. Extending this analysis through other PDB structures revealed that poor modeling at flexible helical regions was broadly applicable to all RNA-containing cryo-EM-derived structures in the 2.5 - 4 Å resolution range. Major Points: It is difficult to keep track of the different parameters applied for each simulation. These are scattered in the text. It would be very helpful for the reader to understand these if the authors could make a table of all the MD simulations with specifications on helices restrained, approach, simulation time, force fields present, equilibration time etc. Clarification regarding the helical restraints and the simulation time for the initial production run would be helpful—i.e. Why was a simulation time of 2.5 ns chosen, and would this be long enough for your purposes considering the relatively high complexity of the system? Were restraints applied to the 3 helices (b,d,i) that unfolded in subsequent simulations or were they only applied to the other 6 helices? In the section “Base Pairing Analysis of the Protein Data Bank,” it is mentioned that the analysis likely over-estimates the problematic modeling of helices in cryo-EM derived RNA structures. Given that 15 Å is larger than the expected 8-11 Å (Pietal, M. J., 2012) distance for N1/N9 distance, would this not underestimate the number of problematic helices? A detailed analysis of H-bonding within the 6 helices would be useful to get a mechanistic understanding of why the 3 helices (b,d,i) unfold and the other 6 don't—for example, it might be helpful to provide a comparison with the model generated from a single structure approach to know if the same H-bonds exist in it or not as the model forwarded by this paper. ERMSD approach: we know relatively less about non-Watson Crick base pairing apart from Hoogsteen and G-U wobble base pairs since so much depends on the context (specific region of the structure, ion concentration, pH etc.) (we’re still thinking about how to phrase this point). Balance between experimental measurements and MD sampled conformational states: lack of experimental validation when remodeling mismodeled regions for RNA - how do we know when specific interactions are too ideal? How is variability between forcefield parameters for divalent metal ions or other ions addressed, especially considering that these are required for proper folding of RNA? Dispersive interactions play a huge role in RNA integrity: how confident can we be about these parameters when comparing various nucleic acid specific force fields? Can these differences lead to unfolding of the 3 properly base paired helices? With reference to the line on page 4: “The trajectories obtained with metainference simulations were then analyzed by back-calculating the corresponding averaged density map and comparing it to the experimental one”, was the solvent density included in the back-calculated density? What proportion of the CC_mask arises just due to fitting of rigid part of the structure and how much of it arises due to the improved fitting of the flexible regions from the 9 loops? Would it be possible to separate these contributions? Minor Points: Would it be possible to show Fig 2C as a violin or box plot rather than a bar plot? This would allow visualization of the distribution of CC_mask for different conditions with clusters representing conformational states that may agree with the experimental data. Is local resolution considered while plotting the RMSF? For this purpose, it would be useful to have a local resolution estimation for the map to help the reader understand whether the unfolding of helices occurs simply because the specific regions were not well defined or if these regions are inherently flexible. How effective is DeepFoldRNA in filling gaps in structure as it is normally known for sequence based structure prediction—specifically regarding the modeling of the 38-nucleotide gap? For benchmarking purposes, applying this approach to other RNA structures or providing additional validation against independent experimental data (e.g., SAXS or chemical shifts from short RNA motifs) could further strengthen the conclusions. Aside from the pre-1r (6ME0) and pre-2r (6MEC) states, Haack et al. (2019) found additional 3D classes that indicated disordered density in conserved regions, which they did not investigate further. They also suggested that the post-2r complex may be captured in one of the 3D classes that yielded a low-resolution 3D reconstruction. Is it possible that one of the structures found by the metainference method could have sampled one of the structures that were not investigated further or the post-2r complex? Why is there a sudden fall in the number of helices formed in 32 replicas (Fig 2E)? Sentence on page 4: “As a result, 32 replicas appeared to be the best compromise between agreement with experiment and computational cost.” Has it been ensured that this is not a result of overfitting? One of the ways to do this can be to use half-map cross validation i.e. to check if the refined ensemble fits both the half maps equally. Have the authors tried to change the weight for 1 μs reference simulation to improve the CC_mask?

Some questions/comments: 1. to which extent this is specific to functional connectivity and not to EEG activity? Like, is EEG activity more, or less, ""driven by"" 1/f activity than FC? To which extent are the results here different from the evidence that if you filter a signal in a specific band you get some nonzero number even if you don't have a pure oscillation at that frequency throughout the duration of the signal? 1bis. If you would like to look at the differences (or lack thereof) between 1/f of a single variable and 1/f of FC between two variables, you could compute FC as cross spectral density and relate the 1/f of the cross spectrum with the 1/f of the two time series. Spoiler: the relation is quite unsurprising, figure here, from the internship work of Thibault Marichal, Ghent University  Btw in the left panel you can see that 1/f changes linearly with time as anesthesia kicks in. What this is due to? Creation of aperiodic activity coming from where? From nonstationary (some waxing some waning) oscillations (see points below)? From somewhere else? Who knows. https://imgur.com/tYyAqCN. 2. computing FC in 4 seconds long windows assumes that the series (and the oscillations in this case) are stationary across the whole duration, like you have sustained alpha, theta, gamma, beta, delta for 4 seconds. Actually for the whole duration of the recording. Why epoching in 4 seconds then? The thing is that even if you have nothing else than perfectly nice and sinusoidal oscillations, but their amplitude fluctuates in time, a 1/f part of the spectrum is generated. See this figure, again courtesy of Thibault Marichal https://imgur.com/y7WJCam. This is unavoidable, but it does not mean that there are no oscillations, simply that our stationarity assumptions are not met. And that's why I think that the activity should be called 1/f but not ""aperiodic"", at least when we re conflating spatiotemporal (neuronal) scales as we do in EEG. 2bis. The spectrum is a whole, separating it in oscillatory bands and ""aperiodic"" or 1/f is as artificial as separating it in bands. But the bands are at least associated to some behavior and to some neuronal activity. 1/f is a bag of everything else, including oscillations (perhaps not when you consider spikes, there 1/f is more specific, but this is not the case here). To this extent, is not surprising that 1/f accounts for a lot of stuff. 3. What does the percentage mean, when in the abstract you write that X% of {alpha, beta, etc.} networks are driven by 1/f? I read it as ""we have 100 alpha networks, of which 23 to 55 are driven by 1/f"". Now, apart from what ""driving a network"" means, it's not clear what these networks are. From the text, I think you refer to connections being retained. In this case you should refer to connections, and specify that this is an average at the group level. 4. what's the rationale of extracting ""networks"" from full correlation matrices? What does ""efficency"", or ""shortest path"", or ""centrality"" means when computed on a thresholded correlation matrix? The fact that these quantities can be defined does not mean that they are meaningful. And if they do correlate with something interesting, is most likely because they are connected to (local) spectral features, see https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809419303416 and https://pubpeer.com/publications/0732054EAAF1E3BC7C8248A8296CFC 5. What is the justification to the fact that the 95% of connections that you threshold away are ""spurious""? Just based on the value? This seems off. And this artificial sparsification of the matrix conflate the thresholding issue with the oscillatory vs 1/f issue. 6. speaking of ""conflating"", you write of oscillations ""conflated by aperiodic activity"". Do you mean ""inflated by"" or ""conflated with""? 7. There's a sentence on covariance matrix computed in the pre-stimulus part, but it's not clear how this is used, and why a stimulus is relevant here. Maybe just a leftover from a study investigating some stimulus activity. Thanks for listening!

Thank you for your contribution and dedication to the field. As I read through your paper, I have a few comments I would like to offer. Fig1: While I was intrigued by the several stainings and experiments carried out by your team, it would be helpful to understand your rationale for choosing the gestational ages of interest. Additionally, since this is a comparative review, it would be useful to visualize the corresponding gestational ages in mice. I also noticed you cited these phases in mice, but it would be much more memorable if there was a clear schematic comparing the two species' gestational ages to go along with the rest of the figure as well. Fig2: I noticed a one-way ANOVA was carried out for several of the corresponding data. However, ANOVA's are designed to compare means of groups with samples >3. In the supplemental figures, several groups were either missing data, or had samples <3. Asterisks marking significance would also be useful to visualize significance on the graphs. Fig3&4: Quantification of fluorescence would be useful to make statistical comparisons. As is, the evidence is too correlative to make any conclusions. Fig5: For clarity, place comparative groups in alphabetical order (ex: 5a and 5c should be 5a and 5b). Additionally, 5k-q show dim fluorescence, and should be quantified to make accurate  statistical comparisons. 5f should be compared via a multivariate-ANOVA. Final remarks: Further manipulative, molecular experiments are required to make conclusions on similarity. A stronger argument could be made if additional evidence were included. Additionally, sex and cultural differences likely will cause variation among your data. Stating the sex of the samples can help make more accurate comparisons between data. Comparative experiments between sexes and across ethnicities in humans may also be useful.",2024-10-15T20:51:50,,Alexa Jennings,10.1101/2024.07.26.605346,Characterisation of human hair follicle development,"Zoe R.

B., Kurteff, G. L., & Chang, E. F. (2023). Inhibitory control of speech production in the human premotor frontal cortex. bioRxiv, 2023-03. This manuscript by Zhao and colleagues examined the role of the human premotor frontal cortex in speech inhibition. The results provide us with important conceptual advances as previous research studies in inhibitory control have been centered on simple motor control such as eye and hand movements (Aron et al., 2014; Schall et al., 2002).  However, we have several conceptual and methodological suggestions for improving the manuscript. Major 1. Statistics The authors reported t-values for each electrode locations, and thresholded the values so they could choose electrodes based on the categories they specified (Figures 1 and 2). However, without knowing the degree of freedom, it is hard to tell whether the activity showed statistically significant modulations based on stopping and production. Further, the distribution of the three (green/orange/purple) populations in Figure 1 and the ES/NF/Both in Figure 2 could change based on how they threshold t-values. It would be useful to get more information regarding how statistical threshold were chosen for these t-values. 2. Beta activity in NF The authors showed HGA separately for Stop+/Prod- and Stop+/Prod+, but did not separate the two groups in showing beta activity in Figure 2G. The scatter plot in Figure 2H indicates that the t-val is higher for NF than that for ES. Although the authors conclude “beta-band activity is not specifically related to early stopping” (page 6 line 8), we wonder if there is a general trend of beta activity showing higher correlation with natural finish. An analysis showing the proportion of ES and NF in beta activity might support that beta activity codes NF while HGA codes ES. In addition, a supplemental figure showing Stop+/Prod- and Stop+/Prod+ in beta band could help readers have a better understanding of beta band activity across these two populations. 3. Latency in “Cue” and “Action” related activity and other connectivity measures The authors showed that “Cue” electrodes have earlier latency than “Action” electrodes, and that “Action” electrodes have correlation with Stop RT while “Cue” electrodes do not (Figure 3). The authors’ interpretation of these results was that “The difference in peak time of stop activity suggests that neural signals may track different events relevant to the stopping behavior in their temporal order. The cue related activity may be involved in identifying the need to stop speaking, which constitutes an early stage. In contrast, later stage action related activity may be involved in forming the stop command and controlling the execution of speech stopping.” (page 7 line 11-15). However, to further support their interpretation, the authors need to show more information about how cue-related activity influences stop-related activity. Connectivity measures between the two populations using Granger causality (as the authors did in Figure 5E) or a different connectivity measure would provide more convincing evidence for their interpretation. 4. Stopping activity in “Midword” and “End-of-word” The authors showed that stopping activity is higher in “Midword” than “End-of-word” (page 7 line 24-26; Figure 4). Are these “Midword” trials all trials when the speech stopped within a word? The authors provided “Fri” as “Midword” example and “Friday” as “End-of-word” example. Is their modulation based on where the subject stops? (e.g. Is there a difference when you stop at “Fr” or “Frid”) Whether there is a modulation based on specific stopping point could provide a stronger support for this modulation based on abrupt vs. complete ending in stopping activity. 5. Granger causality results and additional connectivity metrics The authors provided evidence on connectivity based on “Granger causality.” They mentioned that these are from “raw neural signals” (page 9 line 2). We are assuming this is based on LFP-LFP relationship between two electrodes. However, it is not clear at which frequency they looked at for the Granger causality. Please specify whether LFP signals and frequency range were used in Figure 5E. Further, Granger causality is often susceptible to noise and one connectivity analysis alone is usually not sufficient to support the interpretation regarding connectivity between brain regions (Bastos & Schoffelen, 2016; Strahnen et al., 2021). An additional connectivity metric such as coherence or pair-wise phase consistency between spikes and LFP signals would better support the interpretation. 6. Speech/hand specificity The authors suggested specificity based on motor modalities (page 10; line 12-14). There are separations of the populations for “Speech only” and “Hand only” in Dorsal and Ventral (Figure 6B). In Figure 6A, it seems like that green dots are located more posterior. An additional figure showing separation based on a different dimension (e.g., anterior-posterior axis) could help readers have a better picture of the populations in a different dimension. Recent neuroimaging studies suggested that there might be action-specificity rather than effector-specificity (Liu et al., 2020, 2022).  Whether these two groups of electrodes are intermingled or segregated in a different dimension could give us important insight into cortical organization of action and effectors. 7. Discussion for speech arrest vs. speech error The authors provided “tennmtwo” as an example of speech error (Figure 7A). More examples of speech errors could help readers better understand these errors. If another error was “twenn,” it could be a mixture of speech arrest/error for pronouncing “twentytwo”. A more detailed explanation about how the authors group or define speech arrest vs. speech error can be added to Methods. 8. Discussion about neural circuits for speech production and stopping based on neural modulation The fact that Stop+/Prod+ (purple) cells in Figure 1E show modulations to both production and stopping makes us wonder whether and how the neural circuits for speech production and stopping are same or different. One could imagine that these purple cells might have different connectivity to brain regions that contribute to speech articulation. In the Discussion section, it would be good to add an explanation or speculation about the similarity or differences in neural circuits for speech production and stopping based on the finding of these purple cells. 9. Adding Method details in the Results section The structure of the manuscript follows Introduction – Results – Discussion – Methods. Because methodological details are described at the end of the manuscript, it would be useful to add a few more details at the beginning of the Results section. For example, the information that participants were epilepsy patients is crucial (otherwise the info “left hemisphere or LH, right hemisphere or RH” is confusing). Further, to sufficiently understand the paradigm, it should be mentioned whether every trial required participants to stop and whether the delay was variable across trials. In addition to the range of finished trials, it would also be good to mention the average of included trials. Minor Figure 1C: The “blue” horizontal bars look like green. We would suggest changing the color to a stronger blue color. Page 4 lines 16: It is a bit unclear why “example” electrodes are described here. Representative electrodes can be used for graphical depiction (as in Figure 1C) but should not be used for statistical testing (unless these are the peak electrodes?). Also, a sentence on how stop/prod electrodes were classified would be helpful. Page 12 line 13: syntax (“in additional to” should be replaced with “in addition to”) References Aron, A.

By conducting a transcriptomic analysis of plants with varying levels of tolerance to Cd and Hg, the study identified tissue-specific, genotype-specific, and metal-specific gene expression patterns. Notably, plants inoculated with mercury-tolerant rhizobia strains carrying a mercury reductase (Mer) operon experienced less reduction in nodule number, plant biomass, and iron distribution under Hg stress. This suggests that Hg-tolerant rhizobia can mitigate Hg toxicity in plants, enhancing resilience in contaminated environments.

I have concerns about the validity of the cryoEM result presented in this paper. The authors claim they obtained “a structure of the NINJ1 segment at 4.3 Å”. At this resolution, the following features should be clearly resolved in a cryoEM map of a protein containing alpha helices: •	The pitch of alpha helices (~5.5 Å) •	Large amino acid side residue side chains (e.g. Phe or Tyr, of which there are several in Ninj1) Neither of these features are demonstrated in the figures prepared by the authors. Figure panels S2D and E are consistent with a resolution of ~ 8-10 Å, where alpha helices are resolved as tubular features. No regular indentation or ridging corresponding to the helical pitch is apparent in the figures, or upon visual inspection of the deposited map ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/EMD-42301). No features corresponding to Phe or Tyr side chains are visible. At the resolution claimed by the authors, features corresponding to the side chains of residues Phe100, Phe117, Phe127 and Phe135, which are all located in alpha-helical segments (not in loops), would be expected to be resolved in the map, but they are not. In my view, based on this map inspection the authors should not have made this resolution claim. To support their resolution claim, the authors present Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curves from the cryoSPARC software in Figure S2C. While the FSC curve shown by the authors does cross the 0.143 threshold at ~4.3 Å, the FSC curve exhibits pathologies, which should have alerted the authors to the possibility that the 4.3 Å resolution estimate may be unreliable and that the map should be interpreted with caution. Most notably the curve starts dropping off at around 15 Å, indicating that the signal-to-noise ratio in the map is significantly deteriorated at resolution of ~15 Å and beyond. After completion of 3D refinement, cryoSPARC also outputs a second FSC figure, which includes an additional curve (“Corrected”), which accounts for effects of masking on resolution estimation by the FSC. It is unfortunate that the authors didn’t include this in their manuscript. The most likely explanation for this pathological FSC resolution estimate and its mismatch with the features resolved in the map is that the 3D refinement failed (due to high noise, or preferred orientation, or other pathologies in the dataset or in the refinement parameters), leading to overfitting to a local minimum in the scoring function. Indeed, the validation report for the deposited map and PDB (EMDB: 42301; PDB: 8UIP; https://files.rcsb.org/pub/pdb/validation_reports/ui/8uip/8uip_full_validation.pdf) contains evidence of overfitting during refinement. The orthogonal projections of the raw map (Section 6.1.2 of the validation report) show overfitting artefacts, as do the orthogonal standard deviation projections in false color of the raw map (Section 6.4.2). Such overfitting causes artifically inflated FSC values, which may help explain why the FSC-based estimate of resolution was wrong in this case. Given a map of this quality, it’s unclear how the authors built an atomic model of Ninj1. In that respect, the publication’s methods section is not detailed enough. Table S2 indicates that the authors started from a computational structure prediction from AlphaFold2. Given the lack of any features in the map to help place any residue side chains, I assume the location of key residues mentioned in the paper originated from this computational prediction rather than from the cryoEM result itself. The lack of support for the modeled atomic coordinates from cryoEM is also made evident in the EMDB/PDB validation report by the unusually poor Q and atom inclusion scores for a map/model of the claimed resolution. A Q-score of 0.04 is unusually low and shows very little map-to-model fit. These metrics, together with a visual inspection of the map and model as deposited, suggests that a significant fraction of the sequence was built outside the map and that the cryoEM result does not support the authors’ atomic model beyond the general shape and relative orientation of parts of the alpha-helical segments. The positioning of individual amino acid residues is not directly specified by the cryoEM result and may have come mostly from the AlphaFold model the authors used as a starting point. Note: the above observations should be not be taken as having any bearing on other key cryoEM-based observations in the paper, such as the curvatures of Ninj1 assemblies, which are supported by two-dimensional class averages of cryoEM images and not affected by overfitting in the later 3D refinement process.",2024-10-08T00:33:10,alexisrohou,Alexis Rohou,10.1101/2023.06.01.543231,NINJ1 mediates plasma membrane rupture through formation of nanodisc-like rings,"Liron David, Jazlyn P Borges, L.

In the Introduction, you note that one drawback of RFDiffusion/MPNN-based pipelines is the need to screen thousands to tens of thousands of designs in silico before finding the 10-100 that pass the quality metrics and can be tested experimentally with good success rates. Does BindCraft also require screening of thousands to tens of thousands of designs, or is it more efficient in silico than an RFDiffusion pipeline? You mention in the paper that BindCraft outputs statistics from each design run, and that biasing away from alpha helical binders reduces the in silico design success rate; so it sounds like you have the statistics ready to hand, at least for the targets reported in the paper. I’d love to see these design success rates added to a table, either in the main paper or the SI. Another thing I’d like to see is some quantification of the compute time and cost required to run the 4-step pipeline until 100 designs pass the in silico filters. I understand this cost scales with target/binder size and target difficulty, but I would imagine you have the data required to calculate these metrics at least for the design campaigns reported in the paper. I saw on Twitter that you’re working on a direct BindCraft / RFDiffusion pipeline comparison; I hope you’ll include the computational hardware and total CPU/GPU time for each side of that design campaign.

Simply put: I know that low p-values require sufficient sampling, so do you, and so do readers of the paper."" This seems disingenuous. First, you were not replying to the incorrect phrasing of ""the highest p-values"" and ""elevated p-values"", but to ""better p-values"" In my response to your response, I was clearly referring to elevated relative risk, elevated signal in your heat map, elevated statistical signifigance. I did incorrectly say elevated p-values this time, and for that I apologize, but my points still stand. Whether or not people know that better p-values (lower values, higher statistical significance) come from more sampling is irrelevant. I was not addressing how people would interpret them. I was addressing what could be concluded from them: The highest signal for relative risk (and the lowest p-values for elevated relative risk) does not colocalize with the stalls selling wild animals. Lowering the resolution to just the south-west portion of the market broadens the scope to essentially being equivalent to saying it coincides with where they sampled. ""it's clear that you get the point that 'all viruses aren't equal' and are now moving the goalposts. That's a game you're going to have to play alone."" Au contraire, it's a game you must play alone. You are the one that spoke of different distributions depending on hosts (and transmission methods):""identical regardless of their hosts and modes of transmission,"" As the paper heavily focuses on the raccoon dog as a host (and statements to the lay media do as well), which is the same host, and has the same transmission method (respiratory). I used data that you yourself saw fit to present, to address ""goalposts"" that you set, so I don't understand this objection. Of course, all viruses aren't equal, but we have to make due with the data we have. If we move from different (proposed) hosts, to specifically CoVs: -then the data still clearly shows an association between bamboorat mt reads and bamboo rat cov reads. It also works pretty well for canineCoVs The data is even able to show a correlation between a CoV, and the predator of the CoV's host (snakes and rats) https://i.imgur.com/prBYydu.png Yet it can't show a correlation with SARS-CoV-2 and a proposed intermediate host, I find this strange. ""the way you interpret this is inappropriately ignoring sampling differences between January 1 and January 12. This is a mistake you introduce and is not in Bloom 2024."" I do not ignore them at all, which is why I specifically linked to Bloom's figure 1: https://academic.oup.com/view-large/figure/436646794/vead089f1.tif If we only look at January 12 (so no sampling differences to account for), then SARS-CoV-2 reads are orders of magnitude less abundant than other CoVs seen at the market. On the interactive plot ( https://jbloom.github.io/Huanan_market_samples_addtl_analysis/viral_counts.html), you have to play ""find the pixel"" to get the number of SARS-CoV-2 reads: *20 total from 12 January. In contrast: * 1207 Bamboo rat CoVs (>60x more reads) * 900 canine CoV HeB-G1 reads (45x more) * 551 canine CoV SD-F3 reads (27.5x more) * 319 Rabbit CoV HKU14 reads (16x more) Even the hedgehog viruses have more reads (44 and 45), 4.5x more reads (combined) Why is it that sampling the wildlife stalls was able to detect all these other CoVs in such great abundance, but SARS-CoV-2 barely registered? Isn't the hypothesis supposed to be intense transmission among traded animals kept in poor condiditions, close together in cages, enabling multiple spillovers into humans after many probing mutations/infections? There's no such evidence of that in these samples, just a few scattered reads consistent with shedding from humans passing by. For that matter, isn't the 1 Jaunary sampling less biased? sampling around where the first signs of human infection were noticed within the market? I notice that you and your co-authors did not touch on why it seems none of the wildlife vendors got sick, in contrast to previous market zoonoses (ie: 2002-2003 SARS outbreaks) "" 'even when stratifying by collection date, clear negative correlations still come up' -- sorry I have no idea what this means in context."" https://dictionary.cambridge.org/fr/dictionnaire/anglais/stratifying stratifying: ""to arrange the different parts of something in separate layers or groups"" As per above, and Bloom 2024, if you group the samples by collection date, even in the 12 January collection date group, it clearly doesn't correlate with the wildlife reads. "" you wrote, 'I see nothing new here,' yet then and now you are referencing quite a bit of analysis in our paper."" Allow me to be more precise: I see nothing new of significance here that supports a market origin. You can always do a new analysis, but it won't neccessarily tell us anything new: * We already knew where the stalls were that sold wildlife * We already knew that live wildlife was being sold and which species (Xiao 2021), - notably, this analysis doesn't establish which wildlife was sold live. * Heatmaps of relative risk, which pointed to the mahjong rooms and bathrooms more than any stalls selling wildlife had already been published. * We already knew that there was a lineage A sequence generated from a market sample So from the above, I am left wondering, what are the new conclusions or inferences that can be drawn from this analysis? To me the most interesting one is the source of the raccoon dogs: Xiao 2021 did not report it. The evidence presented here obviously points to them being locally caught, but you and your co-authors did not seem to assign any significance to this. Instead, there is a statement to the effect that the full geographic range of these SNPs is unknown, leaving it uncertain where the raccoon dogs come from, ending up in an identical scenario to that of Xiao 2021, which also leaves the source of the raccoon dogs unknown. So yes, there is more analysis here, but I don't see that it helps answer any questions, or when it does (raccoon dog source), this is dismissed. ""You're also free to flesh out your 'mahjong/bathrooms' origins theory"" I have proposed no such theory of the origin. I am simply stating the fact that the heat maps produced from this data using your parameters show higher elevated risk (and higher statistical significance to that elevated risk) around those locations than around the stalls where wildlife was present. This fact suggests that the heat maps reflect significant human to human transmission within the market, not the origin of the virus, at the time it was sampled. That is not a theory on origin, just an interpretation of the heat maps. I would add that it also suggests that circulation among wildlife at the virus prior to the market closing (exact time period unclear) was low at best - which is also somewhat surprising given that we have seen plenty of cases of human to animal transmission of SARs-CoV-2 (deer, mink farms, domestic animals, zoo animals, etc), which may argue against any significant susceptibility of the animals t0 the pre-D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2.",2024-10-07T08:22:46,disqus_25ZToSOvrx,Ema Nymton,10.1101/2023.09.13.557637,Genetic tracing of market wildlife and viruses at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Alexander Crits-Christoph, Joshua I.

Behavioral regulation by enteric neurons is poorly understood and this manuscript address this gap by comprehensively characterizing the functions of Gr43a expressing enteric neurons using multiple approaches. We were particularly impressed by the assay developed and used in Figure 6 to monitor sucrose transit through the gut as well as the technically challenging imaging of enteric neurons. Overall, this manuscript is a major addition to the growing body of work on enteric neurons (see other recent articles on enteric neurons here: https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-024-01020-z and https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2866-8). The figures are excellent and nicely complement the streamlined manuscript. We have very few minor suggestions that the authors could choose to address during their revisions. •	Figure 3H and I: While the XZ plane convincingly shows that Gr43a neurons innervate the foregut lumen, it is difficult to decipher the differences in anatomy between the two classes. Stochastic labelling techniques such as MultiColor FlpOut could assist in visualizing the morphological differences between the two sets of neurons. •	Figure 4B: It is not clear to the readers why the response with EN-3 was statistically significant but the response EN-4 wasn’t. We did not observe any drastic differences in the two responses in Extended data Figure 4. Besides this one question that would be worth addressing is whether Gr43a is required in these neurons for the response to sugar or other gustatory receptors (if expressed) in these neurons mediate the response. Perhaps something to address in the future.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.12.607533v2#comment-6563744659,biorxivstage,3,"We read this paper as part of a journal club, and have decided to compile a collective review and publicly share it with the authors. This was inspired by the Arcadia Science Preprint Review Pizza Party Initiative, and this represents our fourth preprint review. Ji et al. present a transformer-based foundation model, called Prophet, which stands for Predictor of Phenotypes. The authors train Prophet on a variety of data modalities including gene expression, cell viability, chemical structures, and cell morphology using publicly-available sources. The authors should be commended for using such vast and disparate resources for such an innovative approach. The task of Prophet is to predict assay endpoints, such as cell viability, and to learn a useful embedding space which can be mined to identify novel, and potentially impactful, relationships. Most often, the phenotype prediction is in the context of some form of perturbation. The authors present a variety of benchmarks comparing Prophet to other methods, and they present both in vitro and in vivo applications to demonstrate potential use-cases. The applications range from looking up untested compounds that are similar to clinically-relevant compounds and predicting zebrafish cell type proportions after gene knockout. Overall, Prophet is methodologically interesting and the applications demonstrate that the method may help generate hypotheses at a low cost. However, we have several major and minor concerns mostly to do with clarity, performance, and software. Major concerns: 1. Unclear and inconsistent terminology and definitions. a. It is unclear exactly what the authors mean by “phenotype”. It seems that sometimes the term is being used interchangeably with prediction/output but other times it is being used to describe observable physical properties. Additionally, the authors refer to gene expression as a phenotype, and, while technically true, it could be confusing given the authors are also using cell morphology as a phenotype. Furthermore, it is unclear if the authors are describing the collection of genes in the gene expression vector, for example, as the phenotype, or, if it is just a single gene. This confusion is also related to our confusion about model outputs (whether the output is a single element or a vector representation; see below). Given the word is in the article’s title, it seems particularly important. b. The terminology of “experiments” is also unclear. The authors claim to use 4.7 million experiments, but does this refer to plates, conditions, samples, something else? How did the authors calculate this count? c. At times, it is unclear what format the input data are and at what level of processing. What are the different possibilities of input data and how might a user decide which to use? Can a user input multiple kinds of data? Did the authors apply any sort of post-processing or quality control? d. The output of Prophet is ambiguous. Does Prophet predict a single value per input (or different inputs), or, does it predict a cell state vector? The authors describe outputting a one-hot encoding. Does this refer to the output phenotype? What is this structure? The authors write: “we train Prophet to predict cell viability, compound IC50, Cell Painting morphology features, mRNA transcript abundance, and cell type proportion.” Does this mean Prophet will output all of these predictions if the data you have is only morphology features? Does a user have control over these decisions? Furthermore, the authors write ""Prophet’s transfer learning capability is not limited to phenotypes seen during the pre-training stage. We did not pre-train Prophet on any morphological measurement, but Prophet fine-tuned on JUMP outperformed both the Prophet-individual model trained only on JUMP and the baseline (Fig. 2b).” What is being predicted from the JUMP data? Morphology feature profiles? Images? Drug class or MOA? This needs to be expanded upon to make these claims. Please clarify the output structure and how a user will interact with the output. Figure 1C does not make this clear. e. Critical methodological details are discussed without sufficient detail. For example, the data split and validation strategies were ambiguous. How were training, test, and validation splits handled? What partitioning methods, if any, were used? The three-fold cross-validation procedure also lacked clarity. Were all datasets used in cross-validation? How did individual data-set models training differ and influence the full model fine-tuning? What is the specific pseudobulking procedure for RNA? 2. Unclear justification for Prophet architecture decisions a. The authors present table S3, which provides hyperparameters. How are these justified? For example, the choice of GeLU over alternatives like ReLU or SiLU. Why use an embedding dimension of 512? Were alternative configurations explored? How would modifying individual architecture decisions impact performance? b. 20.1 M parameters is a fairly small transformer, will this model need to grow as more perturbations or data types are added? In other words, how long will this model be foundational until the next best model is released? c. Encoders sequentially relate inputs with a positional embedding. Does this architecture use a positional embedding in the encoder? What does the position represent? 3. Concerns about model comparisons, baselines, and performance a. The authors compare Prophet to much simpler machine learning models (random forest, MLP, linear regression), individual Prophet models (trained using only one modality), and a mean baseline representing the average value of that intervention. The authors write: “This approach follows the same strategy as current foundation models (19, 36, 37), which are pre-trained on large amounts of data and then fine-tuned for specific datasets using the pre-trained model as a backbone.” Why not use these current foundation models as benchmarks for Prophet? The authors should also consider comparing different transformer architectures and non-transformer models (e.g., state-space models) as well. b. Prophet’s performance is low. The highest R2 value is 0.27 with a low of -0.03 and many predictions that perform the same as the mean baseline. Given the low, variable performance, it is difficult to trust Prophet’s output, or, at best, understand which outputs may have incorrect predictions. The authors claim an R2 improvement as low as 0.04 represents a 13x increase in number of hits, but it is unclear how the authors calculate this value. The authors also claim Prophet reduces “the number of experiments needed for viability screens by at least 60x” What statistics are calculating this estimate? c. The ML model comparisons compared to baseline are incredibly low. Results in Figure 2B suggest that the mean is a better predictor than nearly 100% of ML-based predictions (mean baseline is better in 41/45 comparisons). Our guess is that something might be going wrong in the model training or evaluation procedures. d. It is confusing if there is only one “final” Prophet model or if there are multiple “final” Prophet models since each must be fine-tuned to single datasets. Why not fine-tune on all datasets? Figure 2A suggests that for each time you perform inference in a new data category (e.g., cell morphology vs. gene expression), fine-tuning is required? If so, this strategy will lead to variable predictions and perhaps unexpected results and this is not a foundational model, but, at best, a foundational architecture. e. The authors performed a critical analysis, in which they restricted the amount of training data by 50%, 30%, 20%, 10%, and 5%. The authors state: “We found a clear trend: the more treatments and cell states seen by Prophet, the higher the confidence in the predictions (Fig. 2g).” This is an expected result, however, it is unclear how Figure 2G supports this statement. What is an “axis holdout”? Standard deviation of R2 for which predictions? What do the different points represent? How does this show confidence? 4. Concerns about limited discussion of technical artifacts a. The authors mention technical variation in the limitations section, but this should be elaborated upon. How might Prophet’s performance be impacted by technical artifacts? b. Earlier in the manuscript, the authors write: “We universally decompose each experiment into a unique combination of three fundamental elements—the cellular state, the treatments being performed, and the intended phenotypic readout.” Signals from technical artifacts are likely a fourth fundamental element, or, at the least, there should be an experiment to test the impact of technical artifacts. 5. Concerns about publicly-available source code on Github a. We provide a full GitHub review following our manuscript review below. Minor concerns - Pg. 3 ln 5, the authors write: “To train it, we collected 9 perturbational datasets to create the largest compendium of publicly available screening datasets to date:...” The language suggests that these datasets were all collected by this group, but the datasets are all publicly available. Also, the Figure S1 reference probably should point to Figure S2. JUMP is listed three times in Figure S2 (one for compound, one for genetic treatment, and then one for both) Why is it listed for both when it is already split into the two perturbation types? Also, the right subplot in S2B (the complexity trade-off) is a bit misleading. JUMP has far higher complexity than PRISM, for instance, but this graph would suggest otherwise. Perhaps the missing piece not described here is readout complexity? - Figure 1B is a bit difficult to understand. For example, the bullet points for the “intervention” box don’t seem like interventions? It seems like these should be listed elsewhere or the heading should be changed. How is a “gene sequence embedding” an intervention data transformation? - The authors should tamp down claims. For example, the authors write “We did not pre-train Prophet on any morphological measurement, but Prophet fine-tuned on JUMP outperformed both the Prophet-individual model trained only on JUMP and the baseline”. The performance is only marginally improved (0.01). The authors retrained the zebrafish Prophet model, but it would be helpful to see performance for the original prophet model applied. - What is a pre-built plate? “To do so, we used a setup with existing pre-built 384-well plates, each with 352 unique drug perturbations applied to 9 cancer cell lines (Table S9). In total, there were 16 pre-built plates.” GitHub comments and concerns 1. Documentation and Usability a. The README provided by the author is well-structured, offering clear instructions on installation, usage, and licensing, which provides a strong starting point for using Prophet. This level of clarity is especially valuable for researchers and users who are new to the tool. b. While the README provides a good overview, the documentation around model training is sparse. It would be beneficial to include an explanation in the README on how the model was trained and provide a small explanation of the embeddings captured. More detailed usage/inference examples would enhance comprehension.  It’s also unclear how users can apply the method to their own datasets. This will offer quick and easy access for users to understand the functionality and purpose of Prophet. c. Commented-out code and TODOs are scattered throughout the scripts. Best practices suggest removing unused code to reduce clutter and confusion. Example: prophet/ http://model.py #L12. 2. Software Environment and Dependencies a. Users may face reproducibility challenges when trying to set up the software, particularly due to missing environment isolation. Creating an isolated Conda environment or improving instructions around environment setup would help ensure users avoid dependency conflicts. b. The project uses an older version of Pandas (1.5.x), despite newer versions being available with important fixes. Updating the Pandas version would improve compatibility and performance. c. A http://setup.py and requirements.txt are both provided but are not used together, creating confusion over proper environment management. d. No Python version range is specified in the http://setup.py, which led to issues with earlier Python versions (3.8, 3.9). Python 3.10 worked, but this should be clarified for future users. e. The provided notebook requires a specific version of NumPy that differs from what is stated in http://setup.py. Errors occur with newer versions. NumPy 1.24.4 was found to work, but this should be addressed in the dependencies. f. We were able to install it into a Linux machine. However, an error occurs when attempting to install the software on macOS. The error reports: “ERROR: No matching distribution found for scipy==1.14.0” g. A Jupyter notebook is included, but Jupyter is not listed as a dependency in the http://setup.py or requirements.txt, which prevents seamless execution within the provided environment. 3. Other comments a. The repository does not include any software tests or automated testing via GitHub Actions or similar tools. Incorporating automated testing would help validate the code’s functionality and improve its robustness. b. The code does not pass several linting checks (e.g., through dslinter), highlighting the need for improved code quality and adherence to data science best practices. c. The repository lacks key community health files like http://CONTRIBUTING.md and http://CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, which are important for guiding open-source contributions and user interactions. d. Data provided in .xlsx format (e.g., via Figshare) can cause formatting errors and is less open-access friendly than formats like .csv. Switching to a more stable format would improve accessibility and avoid errors. e. In the tutorial notebook, the code blocks are not executed in a sequential order, which can lead to potential bugs. This lack of sequential execution means that changes made in earlier cells may not be reflected in subsequent cells, resulting in inconsistencies or errors in functionality. 4. Recommendations for Improvement a. Address installation issues: Fixing the bugs related to installation and setup should be a priority, as they could deter users from exploring Prophet further. Ensuring an isolated environment setup (e.g., using Conda) would help resolve these issues. b. Enforce version control for dependencies: Better organization of http://setup.py and requirements.txt, as well as enforcing version control for dependencies, would enhance reliability. c. Expand the README: Adding a table of contents, additional usage examples, and sections on contributing guidelines and testing procedures would make the README more comprehensive. d. Adopt best software practices: Implementing clear setup instructions, enforcing dependency version control, and organizing the code more effectively would increase usability and accessibility for a wider scientific audience.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.30.610541v1#comment-6562075341,biorxivstage,1,"We discussed this paper in our Journal Club and the comments arising from our Discussion are the following: 1) Why focus on “rhizosphere soil” rather than “ bulk soil” to study the dynamics of fungal functional groups in fields of different age? The rationale behind that choice is not clearly explained, most of the references used in the Introduction and Discussion sections to explain the effect of time since planting on functional groups come from soil studies rather than rhizosphere studies. The term “field age” is also misleading as it suggests that bulk soil was sampled, and other terms such as “plant age” could maybe be considered. 2) There were no replicates per field age, as only one field per age was considered, although we understand that different plots were sampled per field. Other parameters than “field age” could cause the observed effects on fungal functional guilds, such as differences in soil nutrients between fields, for example. As seen in the PCoA, fields C and D (both classified as “old fields”) are different in terms of fungal community structure. Including replicate fields would have allowed to avoid possible confounding effects. 3) Important details are missing from the field description. Considering the Discussion on the possible effects of fertilization and fungicide applications, information should be added on the agrochemical management of these plots. Was it similar across fields? Across sampling years? Information regarding the soil nutrient status, and possible climatic variations between the two years of sampling, should also be included. 4) Methodological bias was also discussed. For example, most fungal taxa identified with the UNITE database would not be able to be assigned to a functional guild. How did you account for these taxa that could not be included into a functional category? Another possible bias that was discussed is the fact that relative abundance data may not represent what is actually occurring in the rhizosphere: absolute abundance data would also be needed and should be used for the implementation of microbial networks. 5) The discussion could also benefit from adding some consideration on the “functional group” categorization. How categorical is a “functional group”? Mortierella for example is listed as a saprotroph but it can also act as a plant pathogen. Mycorrhizal fungi included both EMF and AMF, yet strawberry only form symbiosis with AMF. As the focus of this study is on strawberry rhizosphere, why not discuss possible strawberry pathogens and symbionts? 6) An effect of plant genotype was not detected on relative abundance nor richness of fungal functional guilds. However, significant effects may be found in terms of taxa composition. Why not include such analysis in the study? Other minor comments are enlisted below. Abstract Results seem to report differences in soil fungi rather than rhizosphere fungi. Why the focus on rhizosphere and not bulk soil? Plant genotype is not mentioned in the Results either, yet it was mentioned in the Background section as an important determinant of microbiomes. Introduction L50: “The essential functions of soil microbiomes, such as pathogenesis, mutualism, and decomposition…”. Is pathogenesis a function? Functions of the soil microbiomes could rather include maintenance of soil structure, fertility, plant productivity… L66: Research gap: “Despite their significance, our knowledge of the dynamics of different fungal functional groups that co-exist in rhizosphere soil microbiomes is limited (Zanne et al. 2020; Martinović et al. 2021)”. The importance of filling this research gap is not clearly explained. L69: “Soil fungal functional groups can be dynamic in the plant rhizosphere. For example, fungal pathogens can accumulate over time, especially in monocultures or ecosystems with low plant species diversity (Cook 2006; Li et al. 2014; Peralta et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2023a)”. These references are for soil, not rhizosphere. Second paragraph of the Introduction: mostly on soil build-up of pathogens, and possible decrease of AMF over time. But this section seems to address the effect of long-term cropping, not plant age (rhizosphere). The rationale behind the selection of rhizosphere as the soil compartment to be studied is needed. You may want to check paper by Sun et al. (2022), published in Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, on the dynamics of fungal functional guilds in the rhizosphere of wheat. Methods Why establish and sample plots (20 x 20 cm) and not plants if rhizosphere soil was considered? Is there only 1 plant per plot (i.e. 3 plants sampled per genotype and field age)? It is unclear. Were the same plants sampled in 2021 and 2022? If not, a plant effect could be observed between both years. Results L205: The increase in pathogens in the older fields is observed for one sampling year only (the pattern does not hold in 2022), yet it is described (and discussed) as a general finding. What happened in 2022 with AMF that decreased dramatically in all fields (both in relative abundance and in richness)? It is briefly discussed as possibly caused by the fertilization regime, which is not described. Differences in community composition could be assessed statistically to test for significant differences in taxon relative abundance between fields or sampling years. Regarding your Figures, stating the age of the field in the “x” axis rather than letters “A”, “B”, etc., could be more informative. Discussion The discussion on the accumulation of pathogens over time is also based on references on soil microbiomes, not rhizosphere microbiomes. Were the same plants sampled in 2021 and 2022? L301: fungicide applications are mentioned to explain the “levelling off” of pathogens in older fields (C and D). Any data on application rates and application dates? This is important if fungal communities are studied. How specific were these agrochemicals? How were they applied? L311-312: Fusarium is a large genus with many species, not all are pathogens. Making inferences such as “the causal agent of Fusarium wilt in strawberry” is a bit far-stretched. Which Fusarium species are actual strawberry pathogens?

First, the authors showed that iPSCs could efficiently differentiate into pericyte-like cells, express pericyte specific markers, and promote angiogenesis, barrier integrity and contractility. They then investigated the differences between iPLCs derived from healthy individuals and those derived from AD patients carrying APPswe mutations. Compared to controls, APPswe iPLCs exhibited a distinct expression of pericyte markers, were able to secrete amyloid beta 1-40 and 1-42 within the media, had an altered transcriptome for key genes involved in cytoskeleton reorganization and metabolic regulation, were more sensitive to mediators of inflammation, and showed compromised angiogenesis, barrier integrity and hypercontractility. Overall, the manuscript uses a novel approach (iPLCs) to investigate an interesting and sometimes overlooked topic - the specific contribution of pericytes to AD pathology and vascular disfunction. Previous work conducted in in vitro BBB models showed that pericytes play a key role in amyloid clearance contributing to the removal of aggregated Aβ from brain capillaries (Ma et al, Mol Neurodegeneration 13, 57 (2018) and Blanchard et al, Nat Med. 2020 Jun;26(6):952-963). Here, the authors focus on the contribution of pericytes in amyloid secretion, emphasizing the novelty of their research. However, the high variability within datasets and the small number of replicates raises some concern. Major comments •	The statement “…overproduce beta-amyloid” in the manuscript title suggests that pericytes have a significant role in Aβ production. Although the authors showed that APPswe iPLCs could secrete 10 times more Aβ1-42 than the control cells, the Aβ1-42 levels are 100 times lower than neurons. Thus, the authors concluded that “contribution of pericytes to total brain amyloid load in AD is limited”. The title should be changed to indicate the main findings of the work and should be supported by the data presented. •	APPswe iPLCs were derive from 3 donors versus iPLCs from 7 healthy controls. Importantly, among the donors, only one had AD, while the others had pre-symptomatic AD or no symptomatology (in this case the mutation was introduced using CRISPR-Cas9 as reported in the methods). The variability in AD cases plus the differences in symptomatology may skew the results and may contribute to the high variability shown in several graphs (Figure 2 A, B, C, F, J). Figures •	The authors should be consistent in the number of replicates used: different groups in the graphs show only 1 or 2 replicates, even for control cell lines, which makes the reader question the reproducibility and accuracy of their findings (see Figures 1B, 1I, 1K, 2H, 2J, 4E). •	The authors should clarify the findings reported in Figures 2E and 2H: the figures are similar, but it is not clear if iPLCs in 2H derive from APPswe iPLCs (as reported in the figure legend) or control. •	The authors should correct Figures 1A and 2I as sample labels are missing. The authors should also modify the arrows used in Figure 2I and 2D as it is not clear to what they are pointing. Scale bars should be added on both images since they show different magnification. •	Figures should be arranged in a consistent manner e.g., same format and order should be used consistently. Discussion •	An interesting finding is that the HIF1a pathway is downregulated in APPswe iPLCs (Figure 3B). The authors should mention this finding in the discussion. This finding could also support the fact that APPswe cells have decreased VEGF levels and impaired angiogenesis and no change in BACE1 levels (as VEGF and BACE1 are HIF1a target genes). •	For future experiments, the authors should discuss whether APPswe iPLCs exhibit differences in oxidative stress, ROS production and mitochondrial activity compared to controls. •	For future experiments, the authors should use cell lines and human-derived cells as models as they may reveal differences from iPLCs. Minor comments •	The authors measured the changes in expression of several pericytes associated genes in Figure 1. However, it is not clear why the authors were not consistent with these specific genes for their further analysis. For example, in Figure 1B they measured PDGFRB, DES, LAMA2, DLC1, and PDE7B while in 1C they measured LAMA2, PDE7B, DES, omitting PDGFRB but adding genes ACTA2 and CD248. Then, all genes were analyzed in Figure 2A-B. Thus, the authors should provide change in expression data for all genes (PDGFRB, LAMA2, DLC1, CD248, PDE7B, ACTA2, DES) in 1B and 1C or provide reasoning for leaving some out. •	Please correct the repeated sentences on page 5: “…which are known to express detectable levels of LRP121 (Figure 2 J). Furthermore, when iPLCs were subjected to pHrodo-conjugated zymosan-coated beads, no uptake of these pathogen-mimicking particles was observed (data not shown). Thus, it appears that the phagocytic activity of these iPLCs is low.” •	Additional edits for word choice and sentence construction are also needed, e.g., pg 10, 2nd to last paragraph, 2nd to last sentence is awkward. Decision for the editor: Major revisions The manuscript presents a novel idea that could advance the AD/CAA field but, at this stage, I have several major concerns regarding reproducibility and possible accuracy of the described findings.

The authors used a SIEMENS WIP sequence of segmented 3D-EPI at a Terra scanner with 0.8mm isotropic resolution during a finger tapping task to see if they can detect previously reported activation in the upper and deeper layer of human M1. The study combines advanced hardware (novel 7T) with advanced sequences (segmented 3D-EPI) and advanced processing (phase-based QSM and laminar signal pooling). Each step is of interest to the MRM readership. The study is overall well described. And the study design is clear. I believe that every design choice is justified and relevant for the overall research question: feasibility of laminar fQSM. In the emerging field of layer-fMRI, there is a big research focus on finding acquisition and analysis methods with the best compromise of sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility. There are about 70 papers about this topic published already. The manuscript at hands augments this literature with a modern set of tools and innovative combination of established methods. The layer results are a bit messy. Layer profiles in Figs. 4 and 6 look quite noisy. This is partly expected for the ambitiously accelerated protocols used here (GRAPPA 6 and 12). The results are consistent enough to claim “feasibility of fQSM”. No group average layer profiles are shown (unclear if group results would be clearer?!?). I recommend the publication of this manuscript with a few small suggestions of revisions to be considered. I list them below: 1.) It is not really clear to me how the M1 ROI was selected. Some previous studies exclusively focused the analysis on the evolutionary older part of M1 (BA4a). (e.g. outlined here: https://layerfmri.com/2018/03/13/finding-roi-of-the-double-layers-in-m1/). Maybe the authors can state how they defined their ROIs? 2.) It is not trivial to obtain interpretable phase data with EPI. given that the authors use CAIPI field of view shifting, they must use the icepat reconstruction from SIEMENS. This framework does not allow saving RF channels uncombined. So it might be helpful to the reader if the authors can state which coil combination method was used? Some of the default EPI Nyquist phase correction methods calibrate the global phase on a TR by TR basis. This would make it harder to interpret functional phase changes. Maybe the authors can mention in the manuscript, which phase correction was used. 3.)  For some of the protocols, Partial Fourier was applied in two directions. This is surprising to me. In my understanding, partial Frontier imaging is based on the assumption that when the image is real (no imaginary part), k-space is point-symmetric. This can be helpful to obtain magnitude data in Partial Fourier without much loss in resolution. But I am not sure if this also applies to phase data. Doing partial Fourier with phase imaging sounds like reconstructing a phase with an algorithm that assumes that there is no phase in the first place. Doing additional partial Fourier in the second phase encoding direction is even more surprising to me. The k-space symmetry is a point symmetry, not an axis symmetry. This means that doing a double partial Fourier results in complete loss of high resolution information in two diagonal directions. Maybe I am misunderstanding something. If authors agree with my worries, they could include a statement in the manuscript stating that their resolution might be affected by Partial Fourier imaging. Maybe they can state in the manuscript which partial Fourier algorithm was used? I believe POCS is not available in IcePat? 4.) The acquisition protocol is relatively ambitious. With extremely large coverage (80-212 slices) and high acceleration factors (GRAPPA 6-12). In the field of layer-fMRI, there are currently only first cautious attempts in the field to get towards whole-brain imaging. But due to the high noise level of these protocols, whole brain layer fmri required up to 51 runs (e.g. see Kenshu dataset). Here, the acquisition protocol is covering large parts of the brain, while ‘only’ activating the sensory motor system. This means that the feasibility test investigated here refers to a worst case scenario for generalizable acquisition protocols. For more tailored, brain-area-specific protocols with smaller FOV and with less required acceleration, and shorter TRs, the results might be even more robust. 5) Stylistic comment: Figures 1,3,5,6 use the term “fMRI” as GE-BOLD. I think this could be confusing. Technically fQSM and VASO are also fMRI. Similarly in Tab. 1 BOLD is referred to at 3D-EPI, whoever VASO is also using 3D-EPI. The authors could consider referring to it as BOLD/fQSM?",2024-09-30T15:48:21,renzohuber,Renzo Huber,10.1101/2024.09.16.613070,Feasibility of laminar functional quantitative susceptibility mapping,"Sina Straub, Xiangzhi Zhou, Shengzhen Tao, Erin M.

I note that it also does not address the points raised in Bloom 2024. It only tangentially addresses 2 points in my post, both of which are apparently misconstrued. The first point that was addressed was about the p-values- however this response did not acurately portray the argument. My post never said it was misleading, but rather that the sampling bias towards the stalls would concentrate the highest p-values near the stalls, even more so than a simple relative-risk heatmap would, making the result of elevated p-values near the stalls expected whether or not the stalls were the origin of the outbreak. Compare: https://i.imgur.com/iDD6D93.jpeg to https://i.imgur.com/2YmYlZp.png The second point ""an argument that implicitly assumes all expectations for all coronaviruses are identical regardless of their hosts and modes of transmission,"" No, it does not assume they are ""identical"", but rather that there are general similarities. I am asking for an explanation why the distribution is so different. Neither mode of transmission nor host explain this - nor does date of sampling. While not explicitly stated, there is a substantial focus on Raccoon dogs. You show the distribution of a virus with the same putative host (Raccoon dogs) and same transmission methods (respiratory). The distributions are strikingly different. Compare https://i.imgur.com/iDD6D93.jpeg to https://i.imgur.com/OFXpCIf.jpeg This paper argued (in preprint), and it still argues )in final published form) that the 12 Jan RNA had more time to decay. Considering the market was closed at the same time, why did the SARS-CoV-2 reads decay to such lower values than other CoVs in samples from the same dates, and within the same samples, as shown by Bloom? See here: https://i.imgur.com/kIOTTYq.jpeg -even when stratifying by collection date, clear negative correlations still come up. Overall, I find that a lot of speculation is offered, but it comes accross as excuses for the data not actually showing that the virus originated from the wildlife stalls. I'll also raise additional critiques now: 1) The heat maps do not colocalize with the potential hosts: SARS-CoV-2 (RR p-values) and Raccoon dog reads shown here: https://i.imgur.com/AyAiag9.jpeg In the paper, instead the focus is on the south-west portion of the market. As I see it, there are two possibilities: i) The analysis DOES have sufficient resolution: in which case the resulting heat map not co-localizing with the wildlife stalls would exonerate them ii) The analysis DOES NOT have sufficient resolution: in which case it must be noted that the eastern and northern parts of the market were very poorly sampled. In this case, finding more positive samples where more samples were taken does not allow any conclusions to be drawn. 2) The analysis of the SNPs of the Raccoon dogs clearly aligns with the the SNPs of locally caught wildlife (the C14859A + A15304G genome from Hubei, and the C14372T, C15102A, C15252A, T15306C genome from Hubei). Despite the evidence clearly pointing to locally caught raccoon dogs, speculation is offered (again) that maybe racoon dogs with these SNPs are found further south. Notably, Hubei (the local province) is not a plausible origin of the progenitor. Pekar seemingly agrees: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.12.548617v1 In essence, this paper shows: i) 3 lineage B sequences 1 low quality lineage A sequence have a (very very wide) tMRCA confidence interval that overlaps with a tMRCA calculated from many more A and B lineage genomes: hardly anything surprising or something that conclusions can be drawn from ii) Within the heavily sampled area of the market, the areas of elevated relative risk don't actually overlap with the locations of the wildlife stalls -There is just one stall on the periphery of an area of elevated risk, the one closest to the entrance/mah jong rooms/bathrooms, which is where the higest elevated risk is. iii) The raccoon dog genomes from that stall suggest that they are locally caught, and do not come from areas with potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2's precursors On balance, the sum of this evidence seems to suggest that the HSM wildlife stalls in general, and raccoon dogs specifically, were not the origin of this virus. Much speculation and many excuses are offered, but it must be reiterated that these excuses and speculation, not evidence. The correlation analysis of Bloom can point right to the hosts of other viruses. The heat maps produced for this paper can point right to the hosts of other viruses. SARS-CoV-2 continuously fails to produce evidence and associations that other animal viruses at the market produced. The way these findings are presented in the paper and to the general public through the media seems to be at odds with what the data actually shows.",2024-09-30T08:04:04,disqus_25ZToSOvrx,Ema Nymton,10.1101/2023.09.13.557637,Genetic tracing of market wildlife and viruses at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Alexander Crits-Christoph, Joshua I.

From observation, I have seen various wild and cultivated viola species not getting any pollinator visits at all despite pollinators busily visiting other flowers in the immediate vicinity.",2024-09-27T11:24:18,disqus_kzmlbL640Z,Ruth Berger,10.1101/2023.05.25.542270,Ongoing convergent evolution of a selfing syndrome threatens plant-pollinator interactions,"Samson Acoca-Pidolle, Perrine Gauthier, Louis Devresse, Antoine Deverge Merdrignac, Virginie Pons, Pierre-Olivier Cheptou",2023-11-07

As it's published at NSMB, the paper doesn't address the fact that the endogenously purified Pks13 used for the above mentioned experiments, using the same purification protocol each time, showed variable SEC traces. After a while, we could not reproduce the peak1 and peak2 peaks in SEC (shown in Extended data fig1), but the two peaks either overlapped, or peak1 essentially disappeared. Sometimes, other interacting proteins were also pulled down along with Pks13, which confounded the SEC traces. CryoEM was done with peak1 with TAM inhibitor added, while XL-MS and LC-MS were done with mixed peak1&2 species. Protein used for XL-MS also had ""contaminant"" species which could actually be functionally-relevant binding partner. Since these protein preps behaved differently in SEC, we are not sure about the functional ramifications of these proteins purified at different times.

Keating, and Gene-Wei Li (MIT): We thank CJ San Felipe, Priyanka Bajaj, and James Fraser for their thoughtful review of our manuscript, “High-throughput computational discovery of inhibitory protein fragments with AlphaFold” ( bioRxiv 2023.12.19.572389). We were pleased the reviewers appreciated our contributions in predicting protein fragment binding modes. The major point the reviewers raise is uncertainty about how MSAs were treated in making the FragFold predictions. We now address this and several other points alongside extensive additions to this paper, including new high-throughput experimental data supporting the computationally predicted fragment binding models. Here we summarize our responses and changes in this revised manuscript, now available as Version 2 on bioRxiv . Throughout, we use bold text blocks to indicate our responses, and italic text blocks to indicate reviewer comments. From introductory comments and reviewers’ major point 1: The major strength of this paper is in developing a method that could be used to identify regions of proteins that are involved in PPI's based on evolutionarily related sequences that recapitulate the native binding interfaces. The major weakness of this paper is that the underlying method of MSA concatenation is not clearly explained (see Major point 1). Why is the discontinuous unpaired strategy optimal relative to other AlphaFold-multimer-like strategies? Overall, the paper demonstrates the power of AlphaFold to closely recapitulate the structures of experimentally determined fragment binding interfaces by working exclusively in sequence space in a high-throughput manner. Further, in the absence of experimental structures, the authors present plausible AlphaFold predictions of fragment bound structures that are supported by biochemical and genetic data which could further contribute to the utility of this method in studying known PPI's. Major points: 1) The authors state that they generated multiple sequence alignments for both the fragments and target protein prior to running AlphaFold2 to minimize computation time. Although it is not clearly explained, the authors claim they concatenated these two MSA's into a single MSA. We interpret this to mean that the input MSA's were not directly pairing the fragment sequences to the target sequences but leaving either side of the fragment sequence and the target sequence blank to force AlphaFold to co-predict the structure of the fragment with the target protein by treating it as a single discontinuous sequence. While we were surprised by the simplicity of this method and the ability to remain in sequence space based on evolutionary similarity of fragment and target protein sequences, there are several questions we have regarding this implementation From the explanation provided with figure 1A, the fragment sequence appears to be directly paired to the target sequence, however in fig 1B the method appears to work by using the evolutionary information of many orthologs and related proteins of both fragment and target to co-predict their structures using a discontinuous input sequence. Is this correct? Could the authors provide a clearer description of how they are concatenating the MSA's? We were also curious to know how different concatenation strategies affect the accuracy of predictions. For example, could the authors also try concatenating directly paired fragment-target sequences from the same species of origin (or even try this as a single continuous sequence)? If the sequences are continuous, does adding linker regions between the fragment and target alter the results? Does the order of concatenation affect the results (concatenating from the N or C-termini of the target?). We thank the reviewers for pointing out this potential point of confusion in our methodology. We have now revised the description of our methods in the Results, Figure 1, and the Materials and Methods to clarify what was done. No novel methods of MSA concatenation were developed in this work. Rather, protein-peptide binding predictions were run using the established approach natively implemented in the ColabFold version of AlphaFold2, in which multiple polypeptides are explicitly modeled as separate chains (Mirdita et al. , Nature Methods 2022). Likewise, multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of the separate protein partners (i.e., fragment and target protein) were concatenated, a standard input for ColabFold required for predicting interactions between multiple polypeptide chains. MSAs were concatenated in a strictly row-wise, unpaired fashion. Crucially, we note that while the MSAs are concatenated (as required by ColabFold), the sequences of the protein fragment and full-length protein polypeptide chains are distinct and not connected. The strictly row-wise concatenation performed here means that in principle the order of concatenation should not matter for these predictions. We do not claim in this work that unpaired MSAs necessarily have better performance than paired MSAs (which we did not test). Rather, we deliberately used unpaired MSAs to avoid co-evolutionary signals of full-length protein-protein interactions being used in the prediction of protein-fragment interactions. As we report in the manuscript, we find that the performance with unpaired MSAs and multiple chains modeled in AlphaFold2 with monomer weights is very good, with protein-fragment interactions predicted well without the model having been trained on multi-protein complexes (only single chains) and not using multi-chain MSA pairing. All of the above clarifications have now been added to the revised manuscript. 2) In Figure 2A, the peaks indicating inhibitory activity correlate positively with the observed peaks in calculated weighted N_contacts, which forms the basis for all inferences. However, the data reveals an interesting observation in the initial segment of the protein fragment (0 to 100 aa) that while there is a peak indicating predicted binding by the AlphaFold model, there is no corresponding inhibitory activity observed for the protein in that region. Any comments on this discrepancy? In the revised manuscript, we now discuss the predicted fragment binding peak centered around residue 60 of FtsZ, which lacks corresponding inhibitory activity in our high-throughput in vivo experiments. As we describe, this region maps to a region of the protein involved in filament formation and predicted to bind in a native-like manner by FragFold. However, this same region of the full-length protein was found to exhibit a high B-factor in previous crystallographic characterization of the binding interface, suggesting it contributes little to the binding energy (Schumacher et al. , Acta Cryst F 2020). We therefore note that this example peak represents a case of a plausible predicted binder which does not inhibit the parental full-length protein interaction. 3) The authors introduce (f_native,pairwise) and (f_native,binding) to quantify similarities between experimentally solved structures and AlphaFold2 models. We found the explanation of these metrics to be confusing, one refers to the fragment and the target site but the other refers to the native binding site bound by the fragment. Is one referring to the contacts made in the experimental structure and the other the contacts in the AlphaFold model? Further clarification of what these precisely correspond to would be helpful for discerning the similarities and differences between the two. Thanks to the reviewers for noting this opportunity to provide increased clarity. In the revised manuscript, we now clarify these terms at the time they are introduced. (These terms reflect, respectively, the fraction of pairwise fragment-protein contacts from experimental full-length (native) protein-protein interaction structures predicted by FragFold; and the fraction of target protein residues from the native, experimentally determined interaction mode predicted by FragFold to be bound by any fragment residue.) 4) In both figures 2 and 3 the authors show structures of the experimentally solved complexes and the predicted AlphaFold models side by side. We were curious to know whether the AlphaFold models were able to recapitulate the sidechain conformations. In addition we were also curious to know whether the AlphaFold model recapitulated any key contacts made between the binding site and the fragment (ex: salt bridges, electrostatic interactions between charged amino acids, pi-pi stacks, hydrogen bonds between sidechains). A full investigation of the quality of sidechain conformation predictions made by AlphaFold is beyond the scope of this work and has been previously considered by others (e.g., Karelina, Noh, and Dror, eLife 2023; Jumper et al. , Nature 2021). In prior work the root-mean squared deviation (RMSD) of all non-hydrogen atoms (including sidechains) between experimental structures and AlphaFold2 models was generally found to be low (e.g., median RMSD of 2.9 Å; Karelina, Noh, and Dror, eLife 2023) but not necessarily sufficient for docking small molecules as well as enabled by experimental structures. Although sidechain conformations were not a focus of our study – and we do not compare in detail between predicted and native structures – we do now provide several predicted protein-fragment binding mode structures including sidechains, comparing FragFold models to FragFold models relaxed with the Rosetta energy function (see new Figure S8). We find that in the predicted structures, details including sidechain orientations and hydrogen bonding patterns at interfaces tend not to change substantially upon Rosetta relaxation,  suggesting that the predicted binding modes are physically and biochemically reasonable (see also the section on further additions to the manuscript, below). 5) The authors explain their use of tiling to generate inhibitory fragments and that overlapping fragments generate greater predicted binding peaks. Have the authors attempted to use smaller fragments in their program (i.e. what is the smallest fragment size that AlphaFold can still predict to be correctly binding?). We are curious to know if effects vary by changing the fragment sizes. Further, can this method be expanded upon to study multiple different fragments that bind to different sites on the target protein simultaneously? We thank the reviewers for raising these interesting ideas. Here the reviewers point out several directions we are excited to pursue in future studies but that are outside of the scope of the current work. We focused on 30-amino acid fragments for all proteins except for LptG, because based on experimental data (Savinov, Swanson, and Fields, PNAS 2022) this fragment length tended to give the best signal-to-noise and specificity of inhibitory effects in these experiments. That said, for the case of LptG, both the experimental data and our FragFold predictions reported in this manuscript were for fragments of 14 amino acids, and we were successful in predicting inhibitory peaks at this fragment length. This result illustrates that the binding modes of fragments as short as 14 amino acids are capable of being predicted by FragFold, and we too are curious how far this finding generalizes, and whether even shorter fragments will still yield comparable results. The reviewers also raise an interesting idea regarding modeling multiple binding fragments simultaneously. While our goals in this work were to model single fragments, allowing direct comparison to our high-throughput experimental data in cells (where each cell expresses a single protein fragment), in the future modeling multiple fragments should allow prediction of synergistic inhibitors, which is a promising direction for designing superior inhibitory peptides, e.g., with multiple binding fragments connected by peptide linkers. Minor points: 1) The orange and yellow lines used to show contacts between the fragment and target are difficult to distinguish from each other. Consider a different set of colors? 2) Figure 4C+E. The use of black in the model makes it difficult to distinguish the sidechains and interactions with the fragment. We believe both of these issues were related to lower-resolution figures in the initial bioRxiv submission. The revised manuscript both includes higher-resolution figures, and in several cases larger figures, allowing for small details including contact lines and sidechain interactions to come through more clearly. A brief summary of further additions to the revised manuscript: In addition to our responses to the comments from San Felipe, Bajaj, and Fraser as summarized above, we herein provide a brief highlight of other changes and additions to the revised manuscript: •	We now include extensive experimental deep mutational scanning (DMS) data on several inhibitory protein fragments. These data reveal mutations that yield further improved inhibitory protein fragments, with implications for designing peptide-based therapeutics. The DMS data also provide systematic experimental support for the FragFold-predicted fragment binding modes, including for the novel binding modes predicted for the C-terminal fragment of FtsZ. •	We perform an analysis of predicted fragment binding energy with Rosetta to show that the predicted fragment binding modes are physically plausible and broadly consistent with those seen for known peptide binders with experimentally-determined structures. Furthermore, relaxation of FragFold predicted structures using the Rosetta force field does not substantially change the binding conformations or binding energies, suggesting the binding modes directly predicted by AlphaFold are reasonable without further adjustment. •	We perform additional extensive FragFold predictions against non-cognate protein partners to further demonstrate prediction specificity. •	We compare the performance of FragFold with an alternative approach, the Rosetta-based Peptiderive protocol.",2024-09-23T18:54:22,andrew_savinov,Andrew Savinov,10.1101/2023.12.19.572389,High-throughput computational discovery of inhibitory protein fragments with AlphaFold,"Andrew Savinov, Sebastian Swanson, Amy E.

The central premise of the paper is to use a yeast selection based around the oligmerizaton/aggregation of Sup35 fused to a peptide (in this case abeta) as a proxy for amyloid forming potential. This is cool information on its own and the experimental analysis and computational framework for linking to energies is top notch. The point of using double mutants to enhance the dynamic range is very well explained and will solidify their approach to impactfully link DMS experiments to thermodynamic concepts. The major framing of the paper revolves around an analytical protein folding/engineering concept of phi-values that highlights energetic differences in the importance of interactions for forming the transition state vs. the ground state. For the textual interpretation of the results, one must buy into the energetic effects of the Sup35 system as a readout of the transition state (and secondarily for FoldX calculations on various PDBs of abeta polymorphs to be a readout of the ground state). The major issue is that an alternative (and perhaps simpler) explanation is that mutations in APR2 are more disruptive to the Sup35 oligomerization process in the screen and that this reflects amyloid/oligomerization propensities and not strictly TS of initial nucleation. The data from previous studies that is used to draw correlations to justify their interpretation around the TS is buried in extended data figures and is a bit all over the place, especially the deconvolution of primary vs. secondary nucleation. The existence of multiple polymorphs in human cells (and populations), which may or may not have related transition states - and the exact conformational requirements of the Sup35 activation mechanism - further complicate this interpretation. In summary - this contains amazing data, but I do not see the language of the interpretations lining up with the strength of the _specificity_ of the claims about the transition state.  A fuller discussion of the limitations of the prior low throughput assays that are referenced in extended data 1 and 2 and detailed kinetic characterization of some of the more surprising mutants in a biochemically defined system would greatly improve the match between the data and the claims. These issues should not stop others from building on this beautiful work - but in doing so, other investigators should note that there remains ambiguity as to whether the effects are truly on the TS or on the ground state.
