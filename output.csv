I just wanted to mention a small details: I think you misplaced a citation to our publication! (Bonfini et al. 2021). You wrote: ""So far, most starvationrefeeding studies have been performed within 2 days of eclosion, when progenitor cells are still sparse (Lucchetta and Ohlstein 2017; O'Brien et al. 2011; Bonfini et al. 2021), or involves prolonged periods of protein starvation of 7-15 days , which triggers high levels of apoptosis and dramatically reduces total numbers of EBs and ECs (McLeod et al. 2010)."" We did 7 days protein starvation refeeding experiments and later on in the life of the flies (Fig. 4A, C,D), so probably the citation should go after 7-15 days instead of where it is now. Good luck with your submission!

However, I should point out that the study is apparently lacking information from the most up to date records on the matter. In particular, the present work is not considering relevant outcomes by Virgili et al. (2022) on the same species treated here. For instance, the records and molecular data of Botrylloides niger, Symplegma brakenhielmi, and Polyclinum constellatum. Regarding P. constellatum, in fact neither Aydin-Önen et al. (2018) nor Montesanto et al. (2022) addressed this species as a cryptogenic. This species has undoubtedly recently arrived in the Mediterranean, although Virgili et al. (2022) has backdated its arrival and spread since 2014. Being the Mediterranean one of the most studied basin both regarding ascidians taxonomy and introduced species, it is odd that such an invasive species could have originated here and being totally overlooked in the past. Although I agree that relationships with congeneric species in the native areas are unclear and should be revised in the future. I may also add that the low intraspecific divergence of COI gene among different localities it is not a sign of cryptogenicity, and other markers/genes should be used to investigate this issue (see Hudson et al. 2022). I hope these comments may be helpful and I am looking forward to see your work published. R.

In vivo validation: Although the 3D organotypic model provides a closer representation of the in vivo environment, validating the findings in animal models or clinical trials would further increase the reliability of the results. Long-term effects: Studying the long-term effects of mifepristone on cancer cells and its potential for preventing recurrence would be valuable for its clinical implications.

As an undergraduate student reading for a journal club course, I found the pre-print well-written with clear language and thorough explanations of background information, making it an excellent introduction to cancer biology and neuroscience research methods for someone with minimal experience in the field, like myself. However, in my opinion, there are several areas in which this publication could be made more easily digestible. In figures 3 and 4, I found some in vivo data presentation choices to be unnecessarily confusing. For instance, in figures 3b and 4b, the coronal slices are in disarray, with large portions of the mouse brain missing, and the use of gray-scale nuclear stain makes it difficult to distinguish hGBM xenografts from the surrounding neural architecture; in the shFGFR1 slice of figure 3b, the xenograft appears indistinguishable from the adjacent lateral ventricle. Moreover, the identical shCo slices presented in both figures 3b and 4b lead the reader to believe that both experimental conditions, shFGFR1 and shFGFR2, were compared against the same shCo group, in which case, the data for all 3 conditions should have been statistically analyzed together and presented in the same figure for clarity. More generally, the use of plunger plots throughout this paper conceals the spread of the data set. An alternative statistical approach, such as box/whisker or violin plots, would have demonstrated the variance in the data. For example, in figure 2b, the mean fluorescence intensity of the tumor core appears to have a more skewed distribution than the invasive edge. Perhaps, this wide range of values reflects the heterogeneity of FGFR1 expression within the tumor core such that there are discrete populations of cells in the core with higher or lower FGFR1 expression. Perhaps, in future experiments, single-cell RNA sequencing with 10X Genomics could be used to identify populations with variable FGFR1 expression within the hGBM xenograft.",2023-01-30T03:30:59,,Nicole Agranonik,10.1101/2023.01.10.523434,Spatial distribution and functional relevance of FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression for glioblastoma tumor invasion,"Nawal Alshahrany, Ana Jimenez-Pascual, Florian A Siebzehnrubl",2023-01-10

Thank you for sharing your search parameters for xiSEARCH and as a developer of that tool I second your choice of parameters completely. However, to answer the question “STY or not STY?” your current search experiment seems insufficient to us for reasons detailed below, and we would like to suggest a number of controls and changes. When allowing either KSTY or KGVL you disregard an important element of link assignment based on the often-incomplete MS data. Indeed, the MS2 data often do not unambiguously assign the linked residue by neighbouring backbone fragments and the likely link site is chosen based on the predefined chemistry of the linker. Fig 2G is a nice example of this. Depending on what you define as chemical preference of the crosslinker, you either report S or G. In all those cases, any residue is equally likely based on the MS data and your linker definition determines the reported site. If STY are disregarded and the abundant GVL are pre-defined, obviously, they will be reported. To put this to an extreme, why do you not disregard K as a link possibility and only allow GVL? We would like to suggest a couple of changes to your experiment: (1) To determine if STY are targets of NHS crosslinkers, only evaluate sites that were reported unambiguously based on MS data, i.e, with neighbouring fragments. Maybe run a completely indiscriminate crosslinker and look for enriched amino acids. Open modification search analyses linear peptides which differ from crosslinked peptides in not having a second reaction step in a spatially confined setting. The first reaction of a crosslinker brings it into the protein, the second reaction takes place with a spatially proximal residue of appropriate chemistry. The second step can only be assessed by looking into crosslinked peptides. (2) To determine if the data support STY as well or as poorly as the chemically meaningless GVL, define a linker KSTYGVL to let STY and GVL compete. Note that xiSEARCH currently will take the more C-terminal residue in any ambiguity window and thus have some random component in link site assignment. If an ambiguity window contains a K near STY, xiSEARCH has a preference setting for K, though. Consequently, if a STY is reported in favour of a nearby K, there must be supporting MS2 evidence in the spectrum for this report. (3) Do the GVL linker experiment (no KSTY). I would expect you to find many crosslinked peptides, nearly all the same peptide pairs as with K or KSTY. (4) Do KYST versus KGVL and match the YST with the GVL peptides where the are the identical peptide matches and compare the score. Plot a 2D scatter plot with score(YST) versus score(GVL). My expectation is that you will have many equal scoring peptides (ambiguity window based on insufficient MS2 data) and many cases where the score(YST) will be larger. As a final note, link site assignment is currently an open issue of crosslinking, and you are right to point this out. Curiously, speaking to Jan Kosinski as a modeller, he did not care about link sites at all. Our own work on using photo-crosslinking (where link site assignment is even more problematic because of the wider reactivity) did not show difference in protein structure model quality using link sites with a +/- 5 residue scatter (PMID: 26385339). So far, it seems to be unclear if link site precision offers any structural value. I hope it does… albeit it might not, considering the length of NHS crosslinkers and the flexibility of proteins.

Himes “A robust normalized local filter to estimate occupancy directly from cryo-EM maps.” The version posted January 20, 2023, to biorxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/202.... The problem being investigated: The interpretation and utility of cryo-EM reconstructions [maps hereafter] is often made challenging by spatially localized degradation that may arise from several sources. To this end, many tools exist to estimate and/or modulate cryo-EM maps non-uniformly. These tools are generally sensitive to artifacts in the cryo-EM maps, user-selected processing parameters like the local window size, and image intensity distributions that deviate from those generated by well-isolated globular proteins. The proposed solution: Forsberg, Shah, and Burt propose a non-linear filter based on the maximal value in a sliding window. While existing tools lean toward estimating local resolution or signal-to-noise ratios, the authors aim to avoid problems this may introduce by starting from the premise that the real-space image intensities should be relatively uniform at moderate-to-low resolution unless there is flexibility or compositional heterogeneity. By starting from this simple premise and selecting the max-value filter, the method aims to be robust as well as fast The results: The filter is implemented in Python. The authors have developed a clean and well-designed GUI that is easy to install, intuitive to use, well-documented, and interfaces beautifully with a USCF-Chimerx, a staple visualization tool in the field. The manuscript is well written, and the results clearly show they can measure non-uniformity in real-space cryo-EM maps. Beyond visualization, they demonstrate that this statistic can also be used to modify the cryo-EM map; however, the full utility of such modifications is somewhat less convincing. That is, of course, no concern, as the improved visualization should already be beneficial in cryo-EM map interpretation. Major concerns: None Minor concerns: 1.     Several minor phrasing issues result in statements that could be understood as factually incorrect if read out of context—these I’ve sent to the authors directly. 2.     “So-called ab-initio 3D reconstructions can now be made without user input bias.” It is worth noting that template-based particle picking or even blob-based picking combined with 2d classification can introduce model bias that persists even when ab-initio 3D reconstruction is used. Even the selection of 2D classes can introduce model bias from the users mental model of the target. See for example, Superstitious Perceptions Reveal Properties of Internal Representations, Gosselin and Schyns 2003 Psychological Science. 3.     Resolution in cryo-EM is not a contested term. It is the spatial frequency at which the reconstruction is no longer statistically reliable. The definition of where exactly that point is, however, has been contested in the past. 4.     A few relative qualifiers should be specific—Eg. “reasonably sized input”, “…reasonably set lower…” etc. 5.     In the methods section, the authors point out that the CDF in eq 6 is only valid for statistically independent voxels. While it is often the case that these conditions can be relaxed, I think it is reasonable to ask for an analysis of or justification for using this CDF, given that the core problem the authors address is one that, by definition, results from statistical dependence between pixels. As a simple example, consider a loop flipping back and forth between two positions, resulting in lower average occupancy. At any given time, the intensity measured in one of those positions is correlated with the intensity in the other. 6.     The value of 449’260 CPU seconds in table S1 seems unreasonably high. Are these measurements the average of several repeated experiments? Please double-check. Final thoughts: The authors have presented an algorithm that is robust to common characteristics in cryo-EM maps and developed a tool to execute that algorithm that is easy to use and open to modify. Well done! I could install this and immediately use it in a project I was working on.",2023-01-23T14:56:20,benjamin_himes,Benjamin Himes,10.1101/2023.01.18.524529,A robust normalized local filter to estimate occupancy directly from cryo-EM maps,"Bjoern O.

In the future, I will be using this approach for all of my large knock-in CRISPR experiments. In my hands, CRISPR using a ssDNA repair template for a large insertion (~1Kbp, GFP) was 30% more efficient than the corresponding dsDNA template. The protocol described in the supplemental methods was thorough and easy to follow. I appreciated the comments that added extra context. Using a single phosphorylated primer and lambda-exonuclease to generate the ssDNA template from a PCR product was simple and only added an extra hour or so to my usual protocol. The enzyme was cheap enough (~€70) and will be sufficient for 100s of reactions. The phosphorylated primer was about 5x more expensive than a standard primer but I think this added cost is worth the increase in efficiency.

The detection of Nr5a2 protein by immunofluorescence is technically challenging. For this reason, and because Nr5a2 is maternally provided (Gassler et al., Science 2022), can the authors rule out that Nr5a2 knockout zygotes still contain maternally provided Nr5a2 protein, which is sufficient for ZGA?

Here are some comments regarding your very speedy reply: 1. Glad to hear your repo will be made public! 2. The LINCS dataset, which includes official access instructions, is detailed in our recent paper (DOI: 10.1016/j.cels.2022.10.001) 3. We include level 3 data in that resource, but I'd advise strongly against using level 3 data. They contain unnormalized CellProfiler features that are incompatible with standard distance metrics. My assumption is that a like-to-like comparison is more suited if the full standard approaches are compared (i.e. I don't think people use the level 3 data all that often, so benchmarking against it is less valuable). I think MOAProfiler is likely to still outperform, but at a lower margin. 4. I agree that testing the generalizability is a very exciting application. I think that for my lab to use MOAProfiler, I would need to see this trade-off. Thanks again!

They use this strain to quantify the number of neurons in the major sensory appendages using an existing QUAS-CD8:GFP reporter strain. The images in the paper are beautiful and the cell counts are a valuable resource for the field. No one has attempted to do cell counts like this before, and this reagent made this possible. A few suggestions to improve the paper: 1)	The authors have not formally shown that the brp-QF2w line is in fact pan neuronal. It would require significant additional work to prove this, e.g. double label antibody staining with RNA in situ hybridization against a pan-neuronal gene to show a 1:1 correspondence. I do not suggest that they do this, but it’s important to note the caveat early in the paper that the genetic reagent is assumed to be pan neuronal because the targeted locus is a neuronal gene. 2)	Speculation on phenotypic/behavioral variability caused by variation in cell number (Line 283-299) seems premature to me. It could be variation in the expression of the driver or reporter, rather than underlying variation in the number of chemosensory neurons. More experiments would need to be done to confirm that what is seen with the genetic reagents reflects actual biological variability. I might suggest that this paragraph be toned down or removed. 3)	Figure 2E-F, Figure 3E: could the authors clarify how the data are plotted and what the sample sizes are. I have the impression that the small dots are individual experiments, but it is not clear.

Thanks for reviewing the preprint — it will definitely help to make the manuscript better and improve the science. For the minor comments, I will go through them individually and make changes as necessary to the paper before its official publication. For the major comments: - The repo will be made public soon depending on how quickly Pfizer’s IP department can review and approve it — apologies for the delays. - For the CP embeddings, we actually derived from two sources as described in Methods: - JUMP Pilot: We downloaded from the repo https://github.com/jump-cel.... To our understanding, this repo was created by the same people who made the JUMP Pilot dataset, and they provided the source and instructions for downloading the CP embeddings used in their study here: https://www.biorxiv.org/con.... If you have another source for embeddings, I’m happy to analyze them! - LINCS: We downloaded them from the repo: https://github.com/broadins.... To our understanding, this repo was created by one of the main developers and maintainers of DeepProfiler for use in benchmarking DeepProfiler against CellProfiler, so we thought that it was satisfactory but we could be mistaken! As with the JUMP Pilot, if there is a better source for embeddings, I’m also happy to analyze them if you can provide a CSV. - We purposefully chose level 3 (un-normalized) embeddings because the MP profiles are also un-normalized and we wanted to compare like to like. MP's embeddings are pulled directly from the model's hidden state without any post-processing or plate / DMSO normalization. Hence if there are better embedding sources, it would be helpful if you could provide level 3 ones. - We did not try combining datasets — that’s part of a potential future work which I anticipate would boost performance as we expose the model to more diversity. Although interesting, we saw this as out of scope for supporting the main claims of the paper. For this paper at least, we did not do a cross analysis (i.e. Model trained on A but evaluated on Dataset B). It might be an interesting supplemental analysis, but we thought that prediction on held-out compounds was sufficient to prove the point we were trying to make. Strong model generalizability to other datasets instead of generalizability to new compounds (as in the current study) will be left as a future (and very exciting!) exercise. Thanks for taking the time to review and help improve the work. I admire what your group is doing for advancing open science!

They benchmark MP against CellProfiler (the standard image-based profiling approach) and DeepProfiler (an emerging image-based profiling approach also based on deep learning) using two publicly-available datasets (JUMP-pilot and LINCS). They evaluate these approaches using precision, recall, and f1 score at k for held out MOA predictions and by comparing similarity between same-MOA and different-MOA profiles. They report an astounding 1,000% performance increase for MP over CellProfiler and DeepProfiler in grouping like MOAs. We thank the authors for posting their work as a preprint - thank you! The primary innovation in MP is the specific training approach. MP uses the same architectural backbone as DeepProfiler (EfficientNet), but trains the model directly to predict compound MOA (instead, DeepProfiler uses EfficientNet to derive representations). Additionally, MP does not perform single-cell segmentation, instead training using full field of views and a series of data augmentations. The authors use the last layer as the per-compound feature embedding in their performance benchmarks. The authors also include several convincing supplementary analyses that further support their claims. Overall, the paper presents a very interesting observation and pushes against a commonly held mindset of analyzing Cell Painting data with generalist/universal approaches. Instead, the paper suggests that fine-tuned models for specific applications are vastly superior for specifically tailored tasks. However, we have two major concerns and several relatively minor comments that the authors might clarify in order to strengthen their findings and claims. Major concerns: - Our primary concern involves publicly-available resources. Namely, the github url is not public: https://github.com/pfizer-r.... Because we were unable to access the code, we were not able to perform a detailed code review. Additionally, the authors link to the CellProfiler and DeepProfiler embeddings they used to benchmark. These embeddings were derived from https://github.com/broadins.... These are not the official LINCS and JUMP resources, and at least one of the links pointed to level 3 profiles, which are not normalized. This could at least partially explain the exceptionally poor performance for CellProfiler and DeepProfiler. - Second, the authors train two separate MP models for both datasets. Did the authors try applying a trained-MP on the alternative dataset? The authors state: “To simulate the real-world use case of identifying MOAs of unknown held-out compounds, we performed an analysis where we split the dataset by compound instead of by wells (Methods).” We imagine that analyzing future compounds using embeddings of a pre-trained MP is also a common real-world application. This analysis would also reveal the level of overfitting occurring in each independently trained dataset. Would combining datasets improve performance? Minor comments and concerns: - The authors state: “​​Although traditional computer vision techniques have proved useful, they often require much fine-tuning and require human intelligence and intuition for deciding which phenotypic features and their parameters are important to measure.” We think this is a really good point, and we are glad someone else brought up the parameters and all the fine-tuning that typically needs to happen, even for generalist approaches. - The authors state: “In contrast, deep learning has emerged as a tool for learning and encoding meaningful representations (i.e. embeddings) without requiring humans to know beforehand what features may be useful for the task of interest.” We may have missed this, but the authors might decide to mention the deep learning limitation of having unlabeled and difficult-to-interpret features. - Figure 1B needs a scale bar - The authors state: “We divided the dataset such that 60% of the wells were assigned to training, 10% to validation, and 30% to test (Methods).” What does “class-balanced the training set” mean? Is this during cross validation? The authors should clarify. - The authors state: “We also ensured each MOA’s test wells spanned multiple plates (at least seven, Figure 2D, left)”. However, Figure 2D shows that most MOAs in LINCS spanned fewer than 7 plates, what did the authors do with those? - The authors state: “We also included the negative DMSO as a class to learn but excluded it from all performance metrics because of its overrepresentation in the dataset”. It would be helpful for the authors to clarify how they handled positive controls. Also related, the authors state: “we performed four analyses to assess how well the embeddings captured MOA-specific features.” How did DMSO perform? It would be interesting to see the distribution of DMSO probabilities across classes, which could point to classes with no effect or how often DMSO features might be influenced by batch effects. - For Figure 3A, the authors should clarify that their supervised learning architecture was multi-class. This is not explicitly stated. - The authors state: “On the held-out test set, the model achieved an area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.46 (random AUPRC = 0.006) for image field classification over 176 MOA classes (Figure 3A)”. How are the authors calculating this random AUPRC? If this is theoretical, the authors should compare performance with a model trained with a randomly shuffled baseline. - Additionally, the authors state elsewhere: “it was able to correctly predict MOAs for 10.2-13.6% of the compounds in a space of 176 possible MOAs. Compared to a random baseline of 0.6%, this is a 17.9-23.9x improvement.” This begs another question of how the authors formed the baselines. Also, why did the authors choose to not include DP and CP in this eval? - The Figure 4B plate map might be wrong. There are more DMSO and what are the NAs? - How did the authors determine the categories “strongly correlated” and “weakly correlated”? At different thresholds did MP still outperform? - The authors state: “Performance varied depending upon whether we predicted MOA by the neural network’s classification output or by a compound’s latent similarity to training compound embeddings”. The authors should clarify how they determined these classification outputs and latent similarities as they are introduced. - The authors state: “(delta = 0.44 for MP, Figure 3C). For both CP and DP, the difference was smaller (delta = 0.03 for CP, 0.03 for DP).” The authors define delta in the figure legend, but this should also be clearly delineated in the methods. - We were confused by the legend in figure 4D - why are each of the models showing a different k? Is this the optimal k? MP doesn’t look optimal at k=4. - The authors state: “From a low-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (TSNE) visualization of embeddings from three example MOAs, we could see that different compounds with the same MOA were clustered together with different MOAs inhabiting different areas in latent space (Figure 3G).” How did the authors choose these three example MOAs? Why not include all of them? It would be nice to visualize all embeddings for both datasets, and the TSNE plots look a bit strange, with highly similar distances between points. - The authors state: “However, the model created embeddings that were clustered by MOA despite each MOA being represented by multiple compounds (Supplemental Figure 1).” Supplementary Figure 1 is not a specific enough reference - there are multiple panels and it is unclear which panel the reader should focus on. - The authors state: “We found minor differences in classification accuracy (0.54 vs .50) suggesting that the model was not leveraging much confounding edge-specific features for its learning” Given the number of NA’s (especially in LINCS platemap in Figure 4), normalization to remove batch effects or TSNE/UMAP to suggest no batch effects would be more convincing. - Figure 6G mentions different shapes in the legend but all look like circles in the image (they are different but it's very hard to tell). The authors also forgot to include the letter g in the figure legend. - Does supplementary figure 3 show MP embeddings? This is not explicitly stated. - Performance across MOA counts for MP is impressive! Very strong performance at low n - In the discussion, the authors state: “Second, all the analyses were performed on compounds with just one known MOA. Understanding drugs that are associated with multiple MOAs is an important task, but our study did not address this question.” The authors seem to avoid explaining this in-depth throughout the article. Why is it an important task and is their justification for not including drugs with multiple MOAs good enough? They mention that they didn’t include compounds with multiple MOAs to simplify the compound space and limit polypharmacology intricacies. Did they try to include compounds with multiple MOAs? If so, I think they should report the results. If the results are bad, then that could give insight into how we can improve performance. - In the discussion, the authors state: “Although DP is another deep learning based approach to phenotypic profiling that also uses an EfficientNet backbone architecture, we observed larger performance gains with MP.” What was the authors’ rationale for using EfficientNet? Also, “architecture” here and in other sentences appears to have a broad meaning. Could another word be substituted for greater specificity? We think it would be helpful to include a diagram of their model architecture. - The authors state: “We permuted each channel’s brightness and contrast independently by a random factor in the range of 0 to 0.30 (just for the LINCS dataset).” This seems non-traditional, the authors should provide a citation. Why not perform this in the JUMP dataset? - The authors state: “As a final training augmentation step, we performed random 90-degree rotations on each image, along with random horizontal flips.” The authors should specify how many augmentations they performed, how did this expand the dataset, were any specific augmentations particularly helpful? - The authors state: “We kept only the compound data that had no more than one known MOA according to the CLUE Connectivity Map…” How often does compound data have more than one MOA from the CLUE Connectivity Map? Would it create a significant difference in results if others were included? How was CLUE connectivity data joined with or used as a filter for JUMP1? - The authors state: “We trained for 100 epochs and selected the model that had the highest accuracy on the validation set. We used a learning rate of 0.1, a weight decay of 0.0001, a dropout rate of 0.2, a learning momentum of 0.9, a learning rate scheduler with a gamma decay of 0.1 at epoch 50 and 75, and batch size of 56 for training.” Did the authors perform any sort of hyperparameter optimization? How did they select these hyperparameters? - For their CellProfiler pipelines, the authors do not explain why they used specific modules. The pipeline utilizes various different modules that I haven’t seen in other pipelines so it would help to know what is being done if there were notes. Reviewed by: Gregory P.

I found the methods, the results and the discussion quite convincing, with just a few questions and observations: 1. I understand that you used 11 additional JEV positive locations for external validation of model performance. 8 of these locations were additional piggeries, similarly to the 54 outbreaks at piggeries that you used to train your model. However, 3 of these were positive mosquito pools, which are very different, could have been collected far away from piggeries, and could be impacted by other factors. However, you didn't mention if model performance against these 3 positive pools was different than against the other 8. Can you comment on that? I understand that these are extremely low sample sizes, but it would be interesting to know if the model predicted those mostly correctly as well. 2. On page 8-9, you describe the habitat suitability modeling for Ardeidae birds. However, I don't see a similar descripticion for the habitat suitability modeling for feral pigs. Was that done the same way? 3. I understand your description that the stacked composite of ardeid suitability as a proxy for regional species richness, but that it only describes the fundamental, not the realized niche. Does this have to do with either alpha, beta or gamma diversity? 4. You're citing a paper by Furlong et al. describing the distribution of JEV mosquito vectors based on environmental niche modeling. Would it be possible to include maps of those distributions in your inhomogeneous point process framework as another covariate? Would it further improve the fit and the performance of the models, or would it be confounded with existing covariates? 5. On line 312, you mention sentinel chicken surveillance data. Was that also included? If yes, I missed it in the methods. 6. Figure 3 seems to indicate that the model was restricted to Queesnland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Is that correct? You don't mention that is the text. 7. On page 12, you mention that the model demonstrated strong associations between JEV outbreaks and proximity to waterways. However, the methods or Table S2 does not include ""proximity to waterways"" as a specific predictor. It only includes ""distances to inland wetland and riparian wetland systems"", and ""distances to rivers and streams"". Which one of these is ""proximity to waterways""? Or is it a combination of those? 8. I find it very interesting that increased precipitation and decreased temperature associated with La Nina were both associated with increased risk in univariate models, but not after accounting for landscape structure and ardeid suitability. I do wonder if this could be because of only looking at a single season where there wasn't much variation spatially across the three states studied, since La Nina affected the entire area. I also wonder if there was collinearity between increased precipitation, decreased temperature and landscape structure and ardeid suitability, which might explain the different results in the univariate vs the multivariate models. 9. I noticed that in the multivariate models you used both Ardeid species richness as well as the square of Ardeid species richness to incorporate a non-linear response. Why did you incorporate the quadratic response for this particular predictor variable, based on what analysis? And why haven't you done the same for the other predictors? 10. I understand that the relationship between JEV risk and Ardeid species richness was non-linear, such that the highest risk was at intermediate Ardeid richness. Were there particular Ardeid species for which the suitability was high at those intermediate Ardeid richness levels particularly, or was it pretty much random, or just based on the distribution of specific species? You do mention the dilution effect in the discussion, and I understand that there is limited information on the host competence of specific Ardeid species in Australia, but it would be interesting to know if there's a consistent species assemblage predicted to correspond with the highest JEV risk. 11. I'm not sure I've seen the results for the relationship between feral pig distribution and JEV risk. I'm not seeing it in Table 1, or in the text, but I see that it had a negative univariate association with JEV risk in Table S2. However, I don't see it in Table S4. Was the decision made to remove it from the list of predictors, even from the full model? If yes, why? Thank you very much for posting such an interesting study, and I'm looking forward to seeing your answers to my questions!

He collected facts and then explored how they might relate. Having already made major additions to these facts, Noboru Sueoka (1995) considered one of Chargaff’s four “rules” – PR2 – in terms of base mutation rates and a “directional mutation pressure,” with little consideration of other facts. With more sequences available, Pflughaupt and Sahakyan (2022) have now extended Sueoka’s work in a “completely assumption free” manner. Supporting Sueoka, their study “reinstates the mutation rates as the major drivers behind the emergence of PR-2.” Furthermore, they have deduced that PR2 gained its universality very early in evolution. This accords well with prior considerations of PR2 using a fact-based approach (Forsdyke 1995). Here an important underlying fact was that effective information systems, whatever their nature, must gain error-correcting ability at an early stage. Accordingly, when seeking to explain introns, it was thought that nucleic acid sequences might contain error-correcting codes (Hamming 1980; Forsdyke 1981). However, as the facts of DNA structure expanded, a genome-wide recombination-based correction process that predicted PR2 compliancy, became more plausible. In a primordial “RNA world” (prior to duplex DNA and PR1) sequences were deemed to be enriched in stem-loop structures capable of mediating error-correction. Into these intron-like sequences, genes would later have been able to elbow their way, and base content would have approached equilibria as Chargaff’s other rules evolved (Forsdyke 2013, 2021). Since some readers of Pflughaupt and Sahakyan (2022) may also read Sueoka (1995), the authors should mention that they use the term “PR2” in the widely accepted historical sense (i.e., it was preceded by “PR1”), rather in the sense used by Sueoka. Furthermore, having downplayed Forsdyke (1995) by citing the works of Chen and Zhao (2005) and Zhang and Huang (2009), they should consider referring readers to his webpage rebuttals (see or search the Wayback Machine (archive-it.org)).

Figure 1A depicts the early to late phases of SARS-CoV-1 emergence in humans. This phylogenetic tree and subsequent analyses are based on the false premise that SARS-CoV-1 evolution in humans during the early to late phases was monophyletic. The first eleven cases of SARS-CoV were geographically dispersed across a wide area from Foshan to Dongguan in the Pearl River Delta area of southern China and occurred over a 4-month period from November 2002 to March 2003 (1, 2). None of these eleven cases were epidemiologically linked. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that SARS-CoV-1 from these human cases had a common viral ancestor from a human. Indeed, 7/11 of the early cases had documented contact with animals. Subsequent studies indicated that SARS-CoV-1 had already undergone considerable genetic diversification in animals before these first human cases were described (3-8). Genetically diverse SARS-CoV-1 has been found in civets and other animals from southern China as well as in civets from Hubei province where the city of Wuhan is located. The high genetic diversity in the early phase of the outbreak thus reflects multiple independent spillovers of divergent SARS-CoV-1 from animals sold in the wildlife trade (1, 9). This is well-established in the virology literature. The SARS-CoV-1 genetic diversity observed in the early phase of the outbreak is not as the authors imply due to rapid evolution during human-to-human transfer. Contrary to the analyses in Zhan, Deverman and Chan the early and mid-phases of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak were polyphyletic with multiple spillovers and limited expansion of several lineages that were not sustained by further human-to-human passages. This is similar to human infections by Lassa virus (LASV), a hemorrhagic fever virus that is endemic to West Africa (10). Yearly, there are thousands of independent spillovers of LASV from Mastomys natalensis and other rodent intermediates or reservoirs. In a similar manner to the early SARS-CoV-1 isolates, the high genetic diversity of LASV isolated from humans is accounted for its diversity in its rodent reservoirs (11, 12). LASV transmission chains are limited in humans and thus genetic changes occurring in humans are predominantly evolutionary dead ends as were all but one of the early to mid-phase SARS-CoV-1 lineages. Zhan, Deverman and Chan stated that, “we cannot ensure that the early-to-mid epidemic samples did not straddle deep splits in the tree.” In fact, it is abundantly clear that the SARS-CoV-1 Isolates from early cases are indeed from different parts of the SARS-CoV-1 phylogenetic tree. That which the authors present as a caveat is the true explanation for the apparent high level of genetic diversity in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak. However, contrary to the authors’ flawed interpretations the genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-1 was generated in animal intermediates and the undetermined SARS-CoV-1 reservoir prior to multiple spillovers to humans. The late phase of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak is characterized by extended monophyletic spread involving a variant of SARS-CoV-1 that had sustained a 27-nucleotide deletion in orf 8 (13). There is a known index patient, a physician from the HZS-2 Hospital of Guangzhou (14). After being exposed to SARS-CoV-1 at this hospital, he traveled to Hong Kong. During a one-night stay at Hotel ‘M’ in Hong Kong he transmitted SARS-CoV-1 to 16 other guests (15). These individuals seeded outbreaks in Hong Kong, Toronto, Singapore and Vietnam. SARS-CoV-1  continued to spread with minimal genetic variation infecting over 8000 people in 25 countries on five continents and killing at least 774 people. The late phase of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak is reminiscent of the spread of Ebola virus (EBOV), another hemorrhagic fever virus, during a typical outbreak (16, 17). EBOV is transmitted from human-to-human with higher efficiency than LASV. Once a spillover of EBOV occurs there can be spread of the virus over extended human-to human transmission chains.  The genetic diversity of EBOV is considerably less than that of LASV (11). Their comparison of the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 led the authors to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 was well adapted or pre-adapted to replicate in human cells, perhaps in a laboratory. Setting aside the naivety of this argument from a virological perspective, in fact the perceived differences in genetic stability between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are artifactual. The three-month interval used by Zhan, Deverman and Chan for calculations in Figures 1 and 2 is incorrect. The genetic diversification in animals noted above occurred over an undetermined time, but likely a period of years or longer, not months. Therefore, the substitution rates of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 calculated in Figure 1C based on a 3-month interval and the analyses in Figure 2 are not correct. An extensive analysis utilizing a more complete dataset and taking into account progenitor viruses showed that the substitution rates of SARS-CoV-1-like clade varies up to six-fold across the genome, with median rates between 4.0x10-4 and 1.9x10-3 (18). These substitution rates were slightly slower than those of the SARS-CoV-2-like clade a finding at variance with this preprint. While the diversity of SARS-CoV-1 as it spread through various farmed and wild animals is known to be extensive based on available sequences (3-8), there remain gaps in this knowledge. The full extent of SARS-CoV-1 diversity in animals that existed at the time of the human spillovers in 2003-4 remains unknown. In this regard the civet viruses SZ3 and SZ16 found at the Dongmen Market (3) are not the actual progenitors of ""Outbreak 1"" as depicted in Figure 5 of the preprint. The unknown diversity of SARS-CoV-1 in animals effectively precludes assigning any one of several known lineages of SARS-CoV-1 found across a broad geographic range in China to any of the human cases. Civets and other farmed animals in Hubei province are supplied to restaurants across China (19). There must be multiple viral progenitors for what is incorrectly referred to simply as Outbreak 1, which is a composite of multiple spillover events. The lone exception are the four cases with mild illness diagnosed between 16 December 2003 and 8 January 2004 that the authors of the preprint refer to as Outbreak 2.  These cases have definitive epidemiological links to animals sold at the Xinyuan Live Animal Market (20). The authors wrote that “… SARS-CoV-2 appeared without peer in late 2019, suggesting that there was a single introduction of the human-adapted form of the virus into the human population.”  However, Pekar and colleagues (21) provide strong evidence that there were at least two introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into humans. Two lineages designated A and B emerged via the wildlife trade in Wuhan. As was the case with the genetic divergence of early SARS-CoV-1 isolates, diversification of SARS-CoV-2 into lineages A and B occurred in animals. It is pertinent to note that the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in intermediate animals in 2019 appears to have been considerably less than the diversity of SARS-CoV-1 in wildlife in 2002-3. Since the preprint by Zhan, Deverman and Chan was posted in May 2020 it has become clear that SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect numerous other species besides humans (22).  Besides this fact and the flaws discussed above, other flaws may help to explain in part why this preprint has - to date - failed to pass peer-review. For example, the authors wrote, “The only site of notable entropy in the SARS-CoV-2 S, D614G, lies outside of the RBD and is not predicted to impact the structure or function of the protein (34).” However, the D614G mutation has a profound and important impact on the structure and function of the spike shifting it to a mostly open configuration the more effectively binds ACE-2 (23, 24). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 has displayed remarkable “entropy” with the emergence of numerous variants of concern. Despite numerous errors and flawed analyses this preprint continues to be used to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a laboratory origin. For example, the misleading quote in the first sentence above is also found in the Prologue of a mass distribution book co-written by one of the authors (Alina Chan) (25). Matt Ridley, the co-author of that book considered that this preprint was “probably a careful and reputable study.” It is not. Nevertheless, Chan and Ridley continue to promote the false premise that this preprint provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may have been pre-adapted for human transmission in a laboratory (26). The preprint by Zhan, Deverman and Chan contains numerous fundamental flaws. It should be retracted, and the authors should cease promoting the misinformation that it contains. Robert F.
