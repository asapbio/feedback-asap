In addition, sentences like “Our results challenge the prevailing paradigm that NLR proteins exclusively signal via their N-terminal domains and reveal a signaling activity for the NB domain of NRC-dependent sensor NLRs.” make me feel like the novelty is “hyped”. The signaling activity of the NB domain presented here is passive, similar to a guardee. The guard model is not novel. This gives a bad impression on an overall good study. The study should be complemented. 1 Most importantly, interaction data between RxNB (and other NBs) and NRCs should be provided. 2 The quality of blots in fig 2 should be enhanced. 3 I think the lettuce experiments should be complemented with Q-PCRs to show that defense genes can be upregulated by Rx/NRCs. This should be required before suggesting the use of sensor/helper pair for crop improvement. Here are a few comments: I find it disturbing that the introduction mostly cites previous papers from the Kamoun lab. I think the use of Rx halves expressed in trans does not bring much to the study and to the understanding of Rx function. Rx full length triggers the same phenotype so why bother using halves? In addition, these halves do not behave like full length Rx in term of oligomerization thus they seem biologically irrelevant. Figure 1B. Red circle, why not Rx full length in red too? Caption: “Experiments were repeated 3 times with similar results” Did you perform 4 replicates of each experiment? Repeat once = done twice. Figure 2 V5 panel is not great. I only see a smear on the whole gel. What is signal, what is noise in this gel? I don’t think we can conclude anything from this. Plus, why should we care about what this chimeric truncation of a protein does? Figure 3D: Why use time point? There is no difference between 3/4/5dpi. Most importantly, where are eGFP and CP-GFP? Figure 4 is nice; I like this part. I would like to have the WB data in the main figure, it would be easier to read (to understand that accumulation is correlated to activity). However, this part could really benefit from protein interaction data. Figure 5: The chlorosis symptoms on the adaxial part of the leaves are not clear. You should remove this and keep only the abaxial pictures to avoid misleading the readers. Figure 6: This schematic is not great. Is the p-loop required for Rx activation or for NRC activation? Is it even a 2step process? Isn’t it just that CP activates NRCs by changing Rx conformation? Also, what do we know about Rx halves interacting together? The structure of the NRC resistosome is unknown, membrane insertion is unknown but here these are presented as facts. I hope this helps.

Unfortunately, I'm disappointed and even irritated. Berryhill et al. ignore (may be deliberately since the key info and refs present in the source which they do cite)  almost the whole body of knowledge about the O antigen-mediated shielding of E. coli the bulk of which (over the last 20 years) has been created by my lab with several important contributions form other teams, e.g. Martin Loessner's group (PMID 34784345). Among our papers this one  and the refs therein covers the essence of the question (PMID: 30814597). The systemic analysis of the current state-of-the-art in this field can be found in my review which I hope to see published shortly and now it is posted as a preprint ( https://www.preprints.org/m.... The phenomenon of narrow spectra of sensitivity of gut E. coli isolates to co-existing phages was also discovered by us (PMID: 17704275) and later studied in-depth and linked to the O-antigen mediated anti-phage protection (multiple papers are easy to find using my name as the keyword). The essential thing is that despite highly effective non-specific protection from of phage infection provided by E. coli O antigen, many phages have various mechanisms to penetrate the barrier. So the fact of this protection does not preclude phage infection in the community. The fact that humans seldom excrete virulent coliphages is long known (see our old review PMID: 19239553), and most probably is due to environmental constraints. The gut coliphage ecology is different in some other species such as  horses or pigs despite the omnipresent O antigens. The isolation of the phages by enrichment on a rough (lacking the O antigen) lab strain pre-programs the poor infectivity against most co-existing O antigen-proteceted isolates. By itself this result means nothing. There are also other methodological problems in this paper.",2023-12-03T11:56:12,letarovandrey,Letarov Andrey,10.1101/2023.11.08.566299,Enteric Populations of Escherichia coli are Likely to be Resistant to Phages Due to O Antigen Production,"Brandon A.

While we appreciate your feedback, we would like address here the points you raised. First, regarding the role of asymmetric tension. We appreciate that your J Phys Chem B (2022) paper tackles the role of membrane asymmetry in defining the budding direction. However, the role of asymmetric tension was reported first, to the best of our knowledge, by Thiam (DOI: 10.1016/j.bpj.2017.12.014), and then, in simulations, in our paper titled ""Membrane Asymmetry Imposes Directionality on Lipid Droplet Emergence from the ER"", published in Dev. Cell in 2019 (DOI: 10.1016/j.devcel.2019.05.003). Second, on maturation and budding. We read carefully your very interesting eLife paper, and we appreciate your contribution to understanding the role of seipin in scaffolding the neck of the nascent lipid droplet - as stated in our manuscript. However, lipid droplet maturation and budding are dynamic, non-equilibrium processes, in which the droplet grows and changes shape in time. We simulated growth and budding as dynamic processes, performing non-equilibrium simulations with non-constant number of particles, emulating lipid synthesis. The simulations in your paper (and all other simulations of lipid droplets in the literature, to the best of our knowledge) are equilibrium simulations, with a fixed number of lipids; they address equilibrium properties of *already budded* shapes, similar to experimental papers showing  *already budded* lipid droplets. Our work, instead, addresses the mechanism of budding as a dynamic process. Being dynamic processes, we maintain that growth and budding were never simulated before (nor observed experimentally, due to the insufficient time resolution of current experimental methods).

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.17.567504v1#comment-6333692831,biorxivstage,2,"I very much enjoyed reading your preprint and have a few small comments: In your abstract it is mentioned that AAP “phenology in freshwater lakes remains unknown”, but a few studies already exist that have tracked AAP fluctuations compared to environmental factors in different lakes. It could be argued that there is still more to learn, each lake may have AAP populations fluctuating differently based on particular factors, and they can be monitored differently, but there have been previous studies nonetheless. Perhaps a small rewording will suffice, maybe suggesting your first integration of AAP into a PEG model, rather than first seasonal study of AAP in lakes. The paper suggests that AAP fluctuate by season, with a spring maximum and then a resurgence in the fall, but it is unclear where this assertion comes from. First, there are no numbers or variance provided, except for a singular maximum of 3.42 - 5.50 × 105 cells/ mL. How much did they vary per replicate vs per season or per year? Did they reach the same maximum each year or were less found for one particular season? Fig S5 is only a heat-map of data, and while the colours are nice, it is unclear if different years had similar trends/ deviation. It would appear that 2017 had an outright absence of enumerated AAP vs 2018 or 2019, and this discrepancy may hinder correlative analysis. In addition, it is not clear how the AAP numbers were calculated, was it from the BChl a autofluorescence microscopy counts? In the manuscript there is mention of the lake becoming stratified, which leads me to conclude that there is a strong possibility for anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs to be present. As lakes have a fall turn-over (mixing), couldn’t the fall resurgence of detected BChl a autofluorescence not be of “AAP”, but instead be a mix (or predominantly) be made up of anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs? What evidence is provided that your measurements aren’t of both aerobic and anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs containing BChl a? Similar reasoning additionally questions if “phototrophic Myxococcota” are aerobic or anaerobic. The reference #100 shows that Myxococcota puf genes could be transferred into the anaerobic Rba. sphaeroides, which suggests it may be a (facultative?) anaerobe, not necessarily an aerobic phototroph. In addition, those authors suggested these Myxococcota have CO2 fixation – another indication of being anaerobic. Also, your nice story ends with a suggestion that while the Myxococotta “contribution was low”, that they are “potentially significant”. In what way are they significant? Perhaps showing some numbers into their contribution, or expanding upon this may support the implied significance. The puf database appears to be a really good asset. However, it is unclear how the AAP percent contribution of the bacterial community Fig S5E was calculated. While the puf database was used for looking into the variability of AAP populations within the community of anoxygenic phototrophs, there is no mention of how you chose AAP of the total community of bacteria that do not have pufM. Presumably you used the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes, but no list of AAP genera chosen for this analysis is provided or cited. Furthermore, while your puf database is indeed impressive, it is stated in-text to be composed of not just type material, but also MAGs (of high quality). While useful to show off diversity of sequences, MAGs do not provide concrete evidence of the respiration statues of any bacterium, particularly if the MAG is divergent from known AAP. Taken together, because your study followed the genes/ autofluorescence of not just AAP, but potentially of all anoxygenic phototrophs, I suggest providing content explaining how you sorted each group separately. If the levels of BChl a containing bacteria are detected by autofluorescence alone, then it is tracing all anoxygenic phototrophic populations, not solely aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs. If your pufM genes are closely related to MAGs that have not been proven to respire and produce BChl a aerobically, then those reads cannot be linked to AAP specifically. Instead, they are putative anoxygenic phototrophs with undetermined oxic tolerances.

I would like to suggest that you integrate at least one LO about phenotypic plasticity, or the ability for a genotype to produce more than one phenotype. Plasticity is ubiquitous across the kingdom of life and impacts a wide variety of traits, from physiological to morphological.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.06.561180v1#comment-6332982781,biorxivstage,1,"Deep mutational scanning has revealed the impact of individual point mutants on protein function and improved computational predictors of mutational effects. However, many mutations observed in evolution and disease are the result of insertions or deletions (indels) and the impact of these mutations are poorly predicted computationally relative to missense mutations. While a few other papers have profiled InDels in a systematic way, the major contributions of this paper are: 1) profiling indels across many different proteins (9), 2) profiling InDels for both stability and function, 3) introducing the concept of high throughput profiling of DelSub mutations (Mutations that remove an aa and substitute an aa in a single event) The authors make a library of substitutions, insertions and deletions of 9 protein domains. They carry out deep sequencing coupled to  fragment complementation assay (aPCA) that is well correlated with expression/stability. They then go deep on two peptide binding domains, comparing functional mutational scans as well. This provides a rich set of data to compare to computational predictions, where notable limitations in current prediction methods are identified. The major limitation of the paper is in the presentation - there is a lot of data and the figures are quite complex - but the text is brief and difficult to follow in parts. An expanded text and breaking up the figures into more figures would likely improve the ability to extract insights from these impressive datasets. Additionally further discussion of the results within the context of past literature would be helpful in guiding interpretation of the study. **Major points:** - The authors included 9 domains that span classical motifs to include in their indel scan. From our reading, it is unclear what rationale the authors used to include these domains. What makes these a diverse set of domains (a/b content? size? eukaryotic/prokaryotic origin? other topological features? etc)? This will help the reader understand how to generalise the results. - In section “Evaluating indel variant effect prediction”, authors can comment on why PROVEAN is better suited to predict insertions and deletions relative to substitutions. In contrast, why CADD predicts substitutions better than PROVEAN? What design choices can distinguish PROVEAN from CADD? Is there a way a model could be trained that could perform well on both? - In the section “Structural determinants of indel tolerance,” the authors mention multiple features that seem potentially important for the effects of insertions and deletions. Currently specific patterns are discussed for the substitutions but the main draw of this manuscript it contains indel mutagenesis across many proteins and the discussion in this section regarding indels are vague beyond that indels are more tolerated at the N and C termini, that the secondary structure is important, and where the indel is seems to have an impact. Currently in our reading these are vague descriptions and perhaps it would be possible to describe general trends? What specific lengths are tolerated vs not? Which secondary structural elements are more sensitive? It would be helpful to clarify these trends with existing literature. For example, previous work in a potassium channel kir2.1 (Macdonald, CM, Genome Biology 2023) found that deletions were more disruptive than insertions in beta sheets especially. Is that also seen? - The authors train a model as described in the ‘Accurate indel variant effect prediction’ section to predict the effects of indels within all the proteins that are contained within the screen and another manuscript Tsuboyama et al. However, there are other previous indel scans that have been done including one within a viral AAV capsid protein ( www.science.org ="""" doi="""" 10.1126="""" science.aaw2900="""">), a potassium channel kir2.1 ( genomebiology.biomedcentral... ="""" articles="""" 10.1186="""" s13059-023-02880-6#citeas="""">), and an amyloid protein that involved the senior author ( pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ="""" 36400770=""""/>). It may be useful to test performance of the model on these datasets that were not generated within the same study and discuss where the model performs well vs those that do not perform as well. - The authors find that insertions can generate gain-of-function molecular phenotypes at higher rates relative to deletions and substitutions. Overall, the manuscript presents the results of deep indel mutagenesis on several protein domains, but lacks thorough discussion of the results. A discussion addressing the possibility of non-native ligand binding following indel mutations would provide an evolutionary perspective that contextualises this research. - The authors mention that some gain-of-function mutations occur due to short insertion mutations. While some domain insertions have been shown to have stabilising effects ( doi.org ="""" 10.1371="""" journal.pcbi.1006008="""">, doi.org ="""" 10.1038="""" s41467-018-08171-0="""">, www.nature.com ="""" articles="""" s41467-021-27342-0="""">), the findings presented here are novel for being short insertions but prior work on domains and deletions of varying type being beneficial would be useful. Emphasising this in the “Insertions generate gain-of-function molecular phenotypes” section and considering how the insertions in the PSD95-PDZ3 domain might increase stability would enhance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving these gain-of-function phenotypes. - Related to gain-of-function: The last sentence of the discussion section references the potential usefulness of indel mutagenesis for protein engineering. As the paper notes, the results here will impact the protein engineering field significantly, so further discussion here will help extend the reach of this paper. Discussing what protein engineering strategies would be enhanced (e.g. directed evolution) would help the reader in evaluating the impact of the data presented. There are a few related papers in the literature (e.g.[ https://doi.org/10.1073/pna... ]( https://doi.org/10.1073/pna... that could support this. **Minor points:** - Several of the figures are very information-dense. This manuscript would benefit from breaking up these figures and reorganizing them to make them easier to understand. It may be helpful also to focus the figures on the main points the authors would like to make within the manuscript as currently the sheer amount of data and analyses makes it difficult to follow the narrative. Additionally, figures could benefit from having secondary structure representations above or below heatmaps to aid in interpretation. - Figure 1 contains A-C labeled sections but contains 9 comprehensive experiments with 6 subpanels each. It is very difficult to evaluate the data when it is so densely represented. aligning an “unfolded” secondary structure below the heatmap for all domains might be clearer than colouring by secondary structure. We find secondary structure coloring to obscure the patterns. - Figure 2 would benefit from significant reorganization perhaps around SH3 and PDZ domains specifically. The spacing within this figure makes it difficult to follow the immense amount of comparisons contained here. Perhaps it would be worth separating this figure up or moving some of the comparisons to the supplement. As in Figure 1 secondary structure above or below the heatmaps would be helpful. - In figure 5E data is shown for GRB2-SH3 in which some mutants show high binding and low abundance. Additionally these mutants are most prevalent in the core and surface. What could be an explanation for such a phenotype for core mutants, since they are bound to have the most destabilizing effect. For the surface mutants, are those residues close to the binding site? Additionally the distributions of these two plots look fundamentally different (with a much higher correlation between binding and abundance for PDZ and a distinct change in the pattern of binding residues being gain or loss of function across the two domains). What does that say about the baseline stability of GRB2 vs PSD95? Or is this more representative of some methodological aspect of the dynamic range and sensitivity within respective assays when run on these specific proteins? - In the heatmap figures the coloring is confusing. Currently they are colored from red to white to blue - in the corresponding color bars next to the heatmaps white is not centered at 0. Presumably 0 is wildtype fitness and blue and red are greater and less than wildtype fitness, respectively. This should be explicitly stated within all figure legends. White should correspond to 0 otherwise it makes it difficult to determine the effect of a mutation. - Figure 3E contains violin plots however a boxplot is missing from these that indicates the median, interquartile range, and whiskers to represent non-outlier distributions. This would be useful in comparing across these variant types - In ‘Materials and Methods’ section, we were confused by the filtering steps taken in the ‘sequence data processing’ section. It would be helpful to include the minimum read cut-off. - Figure 4b should be explained more completely in the figure legend. It is very difficult to make out what the difference in colour for each panel means. - In the last paragraph of the introduction, it would provide additional support and context if you referenced other work with similar findings.

I especially like the testing of different homology arm lengths. The use of non-plant exonucleases is very innovative. I have one comment which I think is needed and would improve the paper .With the Arabidopsis transformants it reads like you are screening in the T1 generation. Is this correct? If so I think it should be made explicit in the paper. Assuming they are T1 plants I think it is important to indicate what proportion of T1 transgenic plants have undergone successful HDR using the donor template. It looks like your experimental design makes it difficult to quantify this as there is not another selection cassette on the T-DNA beyond the GL1 sgRNA which produces a phenotype which cannot be selected for in these mutants if not grown on thiamine. The growth of the thiC mutants on media lacking thiamine necessarily selects against transgenics where T-DNA integration has occurred and HDR has not. As it stands I think the number of seeds sown in this experiment needs to be documented at a minimum. However I would suggest repeating that experiment with a T-DNA which allows selection for transformants on thiamine selected media and either screening T1 plants via PCR and maybe growing on media lacking thiamine in the T2 generation, perhaps the editing of gl1 in the T1 generation can indicate which T2 families should be screened. This would give a better picture of the efficiency especially if people are interested in targeting loci without a phenotype so amenable to selection",2023-11-27T16:40:43,disqus_OzaiuqP6Ey,Geoffrey Thomson,10.1101/2023.11.24.568561,Efficient scar-free knock-ins of several kilobases by engineered CRISPR/Cas endonucleases,"Tom Schreiber, Anja Prange, Petra Schäfer, Thomas Iwen, Ramona Grützner, Sylvestre Marillonnet, Alain Tissier",2023-11-25

I have a technical question regarding the insertion of the targeting sequences into the provirus. I see that you transformed the library into DH5alpha E. coli (or, well, NEB's version of it). In my experience, even when grown at 30C, proviral plasmids grown in this strain (as well as in NEB10beta) can exhibit LTR-LTR recombination, resulting in a heavily truncated form of the plasmid that excludes the entire provirus but retains the antibiotic resistance gene, which grows competitively against the full-length plasmid. The result of these recombination events is that you end up isolating what might look like ""good plasmid"" in terms of DNA yield, but actually makes very poor virus stocks as the majority of the plasmid in the prep does not even contain the proviral sequence. These recombination events can be monitored by simply running the uncut plasmids on a gel and looking for a prominent band around ~3 kb (corresponding to the supercoiled form of the truncated plasmid which should be ~5 kb in length). Long-read (e.g. Nanopore) whole-plasmid sequencing is another great way to detect and quantify the frequency of these recombination events. Switching to NEB Stable E. coli (also grown at 30C) is a fantastic way to reduce the frequency of LTR-LTR recombination. You did a great job dealing with the repetitive sequences in nef to prevent those smaller recombination events, but I am wondering if you have looked for any such LTR-LTR recombination events that would happen already in the E. coli transformants, and if so, do you know how frequent they might be?

As our manuscript was under review and ultimately accepted in the meantime ( https://rdcu.be/drgAc), we did not manage to address all the issues you mentioned for the peer-reviewed version. With respect to PC vs NMDS: we have adopted the method of doing both analysis since PC plots are limited to two variables in each iteration and this can cause statistical limitations with smaller sample sizes (as is the case here). NMDS collapses the variability to two dimensions and does not assume normal distribution. We use these two analyses in a complementary manner (one does not influence the outcome of the other, they are two independent methods). As our interest here was limited to inspect if the data is powerful enough to distinguish expression patterns at the respective time points, we did not focus on further discussion of these tests. With respect to identifying secreted proteins, we used SignalP5 and TMHMM to identify candidate secreted soluble proteins. This was only mentioned int he methods section and we could have added this in the results section, as well. We used the pipeline detailed in Figure 4 to identify the transcripts as noncoding. The tool CPC with a cutoff of an ORF length of 200 bp was used for that. Once again, thank you for your feedback!

Superb imaging throughout. The evidence for 2 mechanistically distinct regimes of PC2-EV release is persuasive. Minor point: I was less convinced by the evidence of ciliary localization of the ∆4-desaturase. The signals are very weak in cilia. A few more images with increased contrast would help. The images in 4C and the counting in 4D suggest that the enzyme is required for both regimes. Could the differences I eyeballed com to significance when more data points are included? The major point has to do with the interpretation that the contact between the worm and bare glass generates a mechanical perturbation. If neither clear nor dense core vesicles are required for glass exposure to trigger PC2-EV release form the tip, then we could only see two surviving  hypothesis: HYP1- the PC2-EV releasing cilia are intrinsically mechanosensitive.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.16.562535v1#comment-6323389801,biorxivstage,0,"Congratulations on this provocative paper which I read with great interest. However, I have some questions about the meaning of the results. Your paper suggests that previously, the prevailing belief has been that there is more hybridization, and therefore more gene flow between species, in plants than in animals. However, your preliminary discussion suggests that this is actually an artefact of “rely[ing] on morphological traits to arbitrarily define species (16),” where ref. 16 is Mallet 2005 in TREE. Although it is true that the data summarized in Mallet 2005 was indeed based largely on morphologically identified species (and their hybrids), it doesn’t rely on a morphological species concept. Anyone who knows taxonomy of any group of organisms knows also that morphology is a rather good, although not foolproof, guide to species status; two sister species, when they co-occur in sympatry, will typically display two modes in multivariate morphospace. Actually, Mallet in 1995 and 2005 argues for a genotypic cluster definition of species, which certainly applies to molecular markers as well as morphology. Two related species, if they co-occur in sympatry, will display a series of genetic differences that enables them to be identified, even if they hybridize. There are two modes in the multivariate genotypic distribution; the relationship with the classical taxonomist’s morphological identification of species is clear. Then you argue “the emergence of molecular data ... enables substituting the human-made species concept with genetic clusters that quantitatively vary in their level of genetic distance (18),” where ref. 18 is Galtier 2019 in Evolutionary Applications. Now that is interesting, as I think Galtier proposes “Species are defined as entities sufficiently diverged such that gene flow (arrows) is very rare or inexistent” (his Fig. 1). In other words, he appears to have a species concept such that gene flow between species is zero. Any gene flow, he argues, would render the situation “ambiguous”. Later, perhaps recognizing that this is too extreme, Galtier proposes using a reference species based system: “...to identify taxa in which large amounts of data are available, and species boundaries are consensual, or can be agreed on. Species delineation in any other taxon could thus be achieved so as to maximize consistency with the reference [taxa].” Now perhaps this dickering about what is a species appears rather unreasonable, since I think we all know (and Nicolas Galtier certainly seems to agree) that there is a continuum between populations that are not species and those that are species. However, in order to disprove the prevailing narrative that plant species hybridize more than animal species, you really must take a stance on what you mean by a species, and what you mean by a population that is not a species. My natural history knowledge of flowering plants and animals such as insects and birds suggests that plant species that co-occur in sympatry really do have a higher rate of hybridization than animal species. Not only is a greater fraction of species involved, but when they do hybridize, there are usually a lot more hybrids. But you will say perhaps: “that is not really the question we attempt to answer.” And indeed it is not, so perhaps you should not have complained that that finding about whether species hybridize was an artefact, which you appear to do. The question you more attempt, I think, to answer is: “is introgression more common in plants than in animals for a given level of genetic divergence, DA?” Rather than a question about species, it seems to me you are asking a question here that is independent of what your (or the reader’s species) concept is (unless you argue that a species has a certain threshold level of genetic divergence). After arguing that “the Tree of Life” is “interrupted by species barriers that are progressively established in their genome as the divergence between evolutionary lineages increases,” you then argue that “The consequences of reproductive isolation can therefore be captured through the long-term effect of barriers on reducing introgressing introgression locally in the genomes, which provides a useful quantitative metric applicable to any organism (4).” Ref. 4 is Westram et al. (2022) J. Evol. Biol. “What is reproductive isolation?” Westram show that it’s actually very hard to measure overall reproductive isolation, RI, which they say is determined by the level of “effective migration” at neutral loci, or the fraction of the rate of neutral genes that actually establish (reduced due to species barriers) in the recipient population, me,  divided by the rate of “potential gene flow,” m, into the population caused by the potential for hybridization and backcrossing, or RI = 1 - me/m. Effective gene flow depends on where in the genome you measure it; in which direction you measure gene flow; whether populations are parapatric or sympatric; whether you want to measure it using an “organismal” or “genetic” focus (in Westram et al.’s terminology). Furthermore, it depends on who is measuring it and how. Everyone who measures it seems to have somewhat different measures of reproductive isolation (Sobel, J. M., & Chen, G. F. (2014). Unification of methods for estimating the strength of reproductive isolation. Evolution, 68, 1511–1522). It doesn’t provide a very useful comparative measure applicable at the whole species level at all. My colleague from Boston University and I conclude from perusing the lengthy discussions in Sobel & Chen and Westram et al. that measuring overall reproductive isolation is unlikely to be useful, and we would be better off just accepting that it is a vague heuristic which expresses something about species (Mallet, J., & Mullen, S.P. 2022. J. Evol. Biol. 35:1175-1182). In contrast, one can readily measure some of its many components, such as “hybrid inviability”, “assortative mating” and so on, and these remain useful and interesting at the whole species level and as comparative indicators. Again, it may seem a distraction that I am discussing what is reproductive isolation, but it seems important here, because you are using a measure of reproductive isolation, and then relating it to genetic distance. In Westram et al., the main concern was to develop an experimental measure of reproductive isolation. Westram et al cautioned against estimating reproductive isolation from sequence data, which is the method you employ here. Their reasoning is that sequence divergence is a consequence only of actual gene flow, me (after taking into account barriers to gene flow), and that there is no way of estimating “potential gene flow” from the same data. In the main part of the paper (e.g. the data points in Fig. 1A), there seems to be a non-continuous measure of reproductive isolation, such that “migration” has a value 1, whereas “isolation” has a value zero. It was not entirely clear to me why this should be so, since, whatever it is, it seems clear to me that reproductive isolation should surely be a continuous parameter. Delving into the supplement, I found that “genetic isolation” was indicated “when our ABC framework yields a posterior probability P(migration) < 0.1304. This threshold was empirically determined by the robustness test conducted in (Ref. 6).” Similarly, the same robustness test yielded “strong statistical support for ongoing migration ... when the posterior probability P(migration) > 0.6419.” Pairs of taxa with intermediate posterior probabilities were considered “ambiguous” and were discarded.  Note that P(migration) is not the actual mixing rate of the populations, me, or the fraction of the genome exchanged, but, if I understand it correctly, the posterior probability that any gene flow at all occurs. This is a very different measure of reproductive isolation from that proposed by Sobel et al. or Westram et al., or anyone else. I think the reason for your choice of a measure of reproductive isolation is indicated by the second question you ask in the introduction: “At what level of molecular divergence do species become fully isolated?” This is related to a common conception of species as irreversibly independent lineages, and the idea that speciation will be “complete” when gene flow becomes zero. But in fact, the “completion” of speciation in this sense seems rather unlikely. The progressive loss of compatibility between diverging lineages seems likely to follow some sort of continuous probabilistic failure law, similar to the way lightbulbs fail over time. The simplest failure law is log-linear with time, although more complex models such as the accelerating “snowball” model of hybrid incompatibility, or the likely “slowdown” model for selective reinforcement, are also possible (Gourbière, S., & Mallet, J. 2010. Are species real? The shape of the species boundary with exponential failure, reinforcement, and the ""missing snowball"". Evolution 64:1-24); but all have a long asymptotic tail. You seem to recognize this stretched out right-hand side timescale by plotting genetic divergence on a log scale in Fig. 1 (although why is “net divergence,” Nei’s DA, the correct scale on which to base such an analysis? You do not explain or justify this). Nonetheless, by making an argument for complete isolation as an endpoint, you ignore the asymptotic nature of compatibility decline to zero. Based on the data we analyzed, it is rather hard to estimate the shape of the failure curve, mainly because the accumulation of incompatibilities is so variable, even among closely related species, such as Drosophila fruit-flies, for example. This variability between pairs of species shows up only in the data, and not in the fitted curve in Fig. 1A, but is more evident from Fig. 1B. Overall, I remain somewhat unconvinced that plants have a more rapid accumulation of species barriers than animals. I agree it is likely that many plants have “less efficient dispersal modalities” than most mobile animals, and that this might mean that actual gene flow becomes lower for plants at a distance from one another, but this is a little different from what I think one would mean by “species barriers.” Reproductive isolation and species barriers should generally be rather independent of geography; in other words reproductive isolation at close range is what we are primarily interested in. This is the problem of using a measure of reproductive isolation that depends purely on actual gene flow. I therefore remain unconvinced that my natural history observations of many plant hybrids in nature, and very few animal hybrids, are not reliable indicators of lower levels of reproductive isolation among plants than among animal species.",2023-11-14T16:49:20,james_mallet,James Mallet,10.1101/2023.10.16.562535,Rapid establishment of species barriers in plants compared to animals,"François Monnet, Zoé Postel, Pascal Touzet, Christelle Fraïsse, Yves Van de Peer, Xavier Vekemans, Camille Roux",2023-10-20

Understanding the role of TAMs in preserving OvCSC presence serves an important purpose in identifying how to improve treatment responses to cancer patients. Here are some general comments I had on the statistics and figures in your paper. 1.	Within Figure 3 (ex: 3B) you utilized medians as markers within your data, while earlier data utilized means. While both are proper statistical measures, the inconsistency in how the data is represented may be a little confusing for the readers. To improve coherence in their data, I would utilize either medians or means throughout the whole paper. Additionally, medians sometimes fail to note any skewness in the data. I think to further improve the representation of the data it may be a good idea to perform a Shapiro-Wilk test to determine the normality of the data. 2.	Within several figures, including 3F, there were very few samples within each treatment group. Since no power analyses were performed, it may be difficult to determine the true statistical significance of the data. To improve confidence in your findings, I would recommend performing power analyses and adding more samples/replicates in future research to further increase confidence in your data as necessary. 3.	Figure 1E indicates the percent survival of different cultured cells receiving different doses of treatments. Despite different cultures receiving different treatment doses, the points on the graph were connected making it difficult to decipher the differences between the samples. To increase clarity in the data, I would represent the data in the form of a bar graph or other similar form to better distinguish the differences between the samples.

We are only building distance trees, and while we've tested it on a broad range of input protein families from both CATH and OMA (which contains no viral proteins) in our benchmarking experiments we did not focus on viral proteins can indeed be very divergent. Since our treebuilding does not rely on a substitution matrix and makes almost no assumptions about the underlying model of evolution at the 3di and AA level, we can't really speak as to how well the alignments fed into a maximum likelihood treebuilding approach would behave. Since these models typically calculate the likelihood based on a substitution matrix that doesnt take structural features into account, this probably won't work very well. Using a custom substitution matrix like the one presented in the foldseek paper may help the problem, but the alignment from foldseek are made using both the AA and 3Di substitution matrices. Using this approach may still be insufficient.

We thought the findings suggesting that SETD1A may be driving the increase in H3K4me3 in MLL1 mutated cells (and possibly leukemic cells with MLL1 translocations) were very intriguing. However, we have several questions and suggestions: In figure 2B (metagene analysis) and C (pie charts), you plot the mean read counts from H3K4me3 ChIP-seq. We interpret the unexpected lack of enrichment of H3K4me3 at gene TSSs in the WT sample as a reflection of the relatively significant increase of H3K4me3 at new gene loci in the MT1 and MT2 cell lines. Is this correct? If so, we believe this point could be made stronger by adding, for example, a Venn diagram of the genes with MAC2 peaks in the WT cells and those with peaks in the MT1 and MT2 cells. You could also create two separate metagene plots based on the data in Figure 2B: one looking at H3K4me3 in all three cells lines at genes with MACS2 peaks in WT, and one looking at H3K4me3 at genes with MACS2 peaks in MT1+MT2. Given that there is likely variability in the chromatin state in different iPSC lines, we also wonder if you performed these experiments and/or analyses using a separate iPSC line? It is unclear how you performed the differential expression analyses in figures 3, 4, and 5. The heatmaps show changes in both the WT and the mutated cell lines, even though we assume the differential expression is in relation to the WT cells? We appreciate there are many ways to perform these analyses, however we would like to understand the details of how they were done here to better understand their implications. What happens if you knock down SETD1 expression in the MLL1-R3765A cells? Do you see the same effects if you KO or KD MLL1? Versus this mutation that prevent association with WRAD?

The authors overlook the fact that the aromatic ring of tyrosine 90 is essential for the SH3 domain hydrophobic pocket structure. They incorrectly present the Src90E mutation as mimicking phosphorylated tyrosine, ignoring the expected disruptive effect of almost any mutation at this site. This flaw raises doubts about the validity of their interpretation, as the observed data may be a result of the grossly disrupted SH3 domain binding site rather than of simulating Tyr90 phosphorylation. 2. The study neglects the tightly regulated nature of Src kinase activity through phosphorylation by Csk. Previous research by Erpel et al. 1995 has demonstrated that the mutation of Tyr90 to alanine impairs the interaction with Csk and the negative regulation of Src kinase. As the mutations Src90E and Src90A are supposed to disrupt the SH3 domain binding pocket in essentially the same way, the authors fail to acknowledge this crucial aspect. This oversight undermines the study's reliability and suggests that the similarities observed between Src90E and Src527F may be solely due to the impaired interaction with Csk. These flaws significantly impact the study's findings and raise concerns about the thoroughness and accuracy of the authors' interpretation. Caution should be exercised when considering the conclusions presented in the study.",2023-11-10T23:23:41,disqus_8IxzsHBcZI,Hui Wang,10.1101/2022.08.23.504940,Phosphorylation of tyrosine 90 in SH3 domain is a new regulatory switch controlling Src kinase,"Lenka Koudelková, Zuzana Brůhová, Martin Sztacho, Vojtěch Pavlík, Dalibor Pánek, Jakub Gemperle, Jan Brábek, Daniel Rösel",2022-08-24

My only complaint is that it does not sufficiently cite previous work that reaches many of the same conclusions. Findings reported here that were previously published for Arabidopsis include the observation that sequences downstream of the TSS, in exons and introns, play a major role in controlling transcription (Rose and Gallegos, 2019, Scientific Reports 9:13777), that these sequences are unlike animal enhancers because they have no effect when moved upstream of the TSS (Rose, 2004, Plant Journal 40:744 and Gallegos and Rose, 2017, Plant Cell 29:843), that a motif containing the sequence GATC boosts expression in a dose-dependent manner and that mutating nucleotides within the GATC motif reduce its effect (Rose et al., 2016 Plant Molecular Biology 92:337). The Rose and Gallegos 2017 paper is cited but only as the reason for using the TRP1 promoter and for identifying the motif similar to GATC. I realize that the number of references is limited in some journals, especially those with a high profile (where I would really like to see this work published), but these seem too pertinent to omit.",2023-11-10T00:14:27,,Alan Rose,10.1101/2023.09.15.557872,Widespread transcriptional regulation from within transcribed regions in plants,"Yoav Voichek, Gabriela Hristova, Almudena Mollá-Morales, Detlef Weigel, Magnus Nordborg",2023-09-17
