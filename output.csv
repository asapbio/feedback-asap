Here are our highlights: Inefficient intron splicing is repurposed as a regulatory mechanism. What might seem like a limitation, instead becomes something functional, an idea that might apply to a diversity of signaling pathways with a prominent rate limiting step. Identifying other genes with similar ""IntP-like"" introns shows that the tim mechanism likely isn't a one-off, but part of a post-transcriptional regulatory strategy that could apply to development and stress response as well. Classic models of circadian regulation focus heavily on proteins and transcriptional feedback. This paper argues that RNA processing can be an intrinsic timing mechanism, revealing a new method for clock control.

Here are our highlights: This work models viral adaptation not as isolated mutations but as evolutionary escape trajectories constrained by both protein viability and antibody pressure. The authors show that escape proceeds through narrow and predictable “escape funnels”, consistent with convergent mutations observed in SARS-CoV-2 variants. Combining generative RBM models with mean-field trajectory analysis enables quantitative estimates of path entropy and fitness cost. The model captures the direction of antigenic drift and enables prospective prediction of antibody escape, including for therapeutic cocktails: anti-correlated escape profiles force viruses onto longer, costlier routes. The model shows impressive predictive power. It demonstrates that, despite the potentially vast mutational landscape, the virus tends to follow a limited set of evolutionary routes, many of which are already observed in Omicron variants. The approach is broadly applicable and offers a principled route to rational therapeutic design for rapidly evolving pathogens  - for instance, for HIV and influenza.",2025-11-11T14:11:18,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

Here are our highlights: The authors build alignments of human and great-ape Telomere-to-Telomere genome assemblies across multiple individuals. This allows them to separate true lineage-specific divergence from ordinary human polymorphism, a long-standing limitation in studies of human accelerated regions. They identify ~1,600 “Consensus HAQERs” (human ancestor quickly evolved regions) -regions that diverged rapidly between the human-chimpanzee ancestor and the ancestral node of modern humans. These loci mark only 0.05% of the genome but carry signatures of elevated mutation rate and ancient positive selection. HAQERs are enriched in ""bivalent chromatin states"" - regions poised between repression and activation. The same regions overlap GWAS loci for psychiatric, endocrine, and cancer-related traits, suggesting that the sequence changes shaping human-specific evolution also underlie modern disease susceptibility.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.08.687325v1#comment-6794756956,biorxivstage,0,"The work presented in Tan et al. is provocative, suggesting that during asexual spore dispersal Neurospora crassa segregates its chromosomes across multiple nuclei, instead of the nuclei being mitotic copies of each other as previously assumed. While similar to the results that some of these authors have presented in Botrytis and Sclerotinia, showing this in a genetic model organism would provide the genetic tools to dissect this phenomenon. However, the results presented here lack definitive proof. The evidence presented can be summarised as follows: 1) relatively low measured DNA per spore, based on DAPI fluorescence, compared to yeast 2) chromosome specific probes show patchy distribution across nuclei, compared to probes that target all chromosomes. The first line of evidence suffers from an apples-to-oranges comparison, because the comparison is across species. The compound DAPI binds to the AT regions of DNA, and so differences between species in both AT% as well as those that affect general fluorescence, will influence this measurement. For instance, yeast has 62% AT genome, while Neurospora has 46%. Highlighting the futility of such comparisons, the data in Figure 1C shows clearly that while N. crassa has a haploid genome that is 4 times as large as yeast (compare 1st and 3rd columns), the fluorescence signal is equal (compare 6th and 4th column). Even assuming the authors’ hypothesis, there is still ""too little"" fluorescence given the genome size of N. crassa. Clearly, while within a species there is a strong correlation between genome size and fluorescence, when compared across species such correlation disappears. The second evidence is from fluorescent hybridisation. Here the authors show that a FISH probe specific to chromosome 1 is never found in more than one nuclei, while a telomere probe that targets all chromosomes is more often found in multiple nuclei. The main issue is that the claims rely on negative evidence, that is to say the absence of signal. However, the absence of signal is not a strong signal of absence. FISH is a very sensitive process, and differences in probe design and washing steps can greatly affect the process. Highlighting this, in 14% of spores, the authors' own chromosome 1 specific probe does not bind to either nucleus. If this data was to be taken at face value, this would indicate 14% of spores lack Chr1, which would be inviable. Extrapolating across all chromosomes, we would only expect 36% of spores to have all chromosomes and be viable ((1-0.14)^7). Such low viability is inconsistent with observed spore viability of N. crassa, which generally exceeds 95%. An alternative explanation is that the probe binding is not very efficient. This is supported by the telomere probe, where it remained undetected in 10% of conidia , despite this probe targeting 14 different chromosomal regions!  Again, taken at face value this would indicate that a significant fraction of spore nuclei lack chromosomes entirely. Notably, only 64% of spores had all nuclei with signal from this telomere probe. Aside from inconclusive data, the claims here are also inconsistent with the basic empirical genetics of this fungus. It has been known for decades that when one wishes to isolate loss-of-function mutants in N. crassa, like the auxotrophic mutants used to demonstrate the ""one gene - one enzyme"" principle, regular macroconidia do not work. Instead, microconidia prove useful, allowing for the easy isolation of such mutants (Catcheside, 1954). This provides powerful evidence that macroconidia have redundant nuclei, which compensate for loss-of-function mutations (See Gross and Lester 1958 for further discussion). One only needs to read the experimental methods of Beadle and Tatum to see the effort in isolating auxotrophic mutants in this organism. Instead of simply mutagenizing conidia to obtain auxotrophs, they needed to use the extremely labour intensive purification process of individually crossing mutagenized conidia to a wild-type background, to be able to isolate homokaryotic ascospores (Beadle and Tatum; 1954). This is also true of genetic transformations, which are performed on macroconidia. Transformants always need to be purified, as the original colony that grows on selective medium generally contains a mix of transformed and untransformed nuclei. If the macroconidia would contain a single haploid genome, divided over multiple nuclei, as suggested by Tan et al, there would be no need to purify induced mutations. Further, the claims here are also inconsistent with the evolutionary dynamics of this fungus. This fungus is the foundation of the studies in heterokaryosis, the presence of multiple distinct genotypes within a single mycelia. Arising from either de novo mutations, or from fusion of two mycelial hyphae, such heterokaryons in Neurospora are quite stable. It is well-described that conidia can be heterokaryotic, meaning a single conidium inherits two distinct genotypes. This has been studied in detail for the soft mutation, where up to 40% of conidia are heterokaryotic, containing both the wild type and mutant alleles of the soft gene (Figure 2A; Grum-Grizmaylo et al. 2021). This is not due to specific dynamics of the soft mutation, as similar ratios of homokaryotic and heterokaryotic macroconidia have been observed in auxotrophs (Atwood and Mukai, 1955), which were used to form the current model of random segregation into multiple mitotic nuclei in Neurospora. A recent example of such evidence has been shown by Mela and Glass, who inserted either green or red fluorescence into the his3 locus in different genotypes, and using fluorescent microscopy they readily recover ±40% of conidia with both colors (Figure 1f; Mela and Glass, 2023). The claims made by Tan et al. are strong and in my opinion the evidence does not rise to the level needed. Measures like fluorescence intensity or hybridisation can never be definitive and therefore are at most a start of further experimentation. However, the predictions of incomplete chromosome sets per nuclei can be definitively tested through single nucleus sequencing. The technology has advanced to the level that single nuclei can be reliably processed for whole genome sequencing, which is the most reliable way to determine if these claims ultimately reflect reality.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.20.683404v1#comment-6793299565,biorxivstage,1,"Dear authors, at first, congratulations to this important findings. This data, paired with other ancient DNA evidence, can further clarify the demographic patterns of the peopling of Eastern Eurasia and Oceania, as well as their interactions with archaic human groups. Different deeply branching Denisovan components can be very useful data points for possible migration routes and or population substructure scenarios. In your pre-print, you argued for a possible earlier southern route into Oceania, followed by a later wave of the ancestors of South Asians (AASI) and East Asians, with East Asians via a possible northerly route: ""This supports an early migration of the ancestors of Oceanians through South Asia followed by the later arrival of the ancestors of present-day South Asians. East Asians do not share this Denisovan component in their genomes, suggesting that their ancestors arrived independently, perhaps by a northerly route"". One major problem with this scenario is the observed genetic affinity between the different ""basal Asian"" populations (e.g. Tianyuan, Önge, Hoabinhian, Xingyi_EN, Jōmon/Shiraho_27k, AASI, and Australasians/Oceanians such as Papuans); also known as ""eastern non-Africans"" (ENA) or ""East Eurasian Core"" (EEC). The aDNA data strongly suggest a single dispersal route and subsequent rapid diversification into multiple basal Asian lineages (presumably in the South-Southeast Asia region via a single Southern route). E.g. Oceanians/Papuans can successfully be modeled (qpAdm/qpWave) as simply Önge-like + additional Denisovan; or alternatively as Tianyuan-like + additional Denisovan. They do not fit as outgroup to ""West/East Eurasians"" either, but are nested within the ""Eastern"" clade (e.g cluster with Önge, Tianyuan, or present-day East Asians). Although it is possible to reproduce a signal affilated with a distinct earlier southern coastal route (proxied by ZlatyKun_45k); this wave however left only minor ancestry among present-day Oceanians/Papuans (and or South Asians), with the majority ancestry of them being derived from the same source as Önge or Tianyuan: e.g. ZlatyKun + Önge-like + extra Denisovan, in a 3–5%, 92–95%, and 2–3% ratio respectively. (qpGraph models allow higher ""early ancestry"" for Oceanians/Papuans: 12–24% when splitting before or at around the same time as ZlatyKun/Ranis, or up to 44% when splitting at the same time as Ust'Ishim.) Beyond that, a northern route entry for the ancestors of East Asians seems to be only partially possible, as the majority ancestry of East Asians seems to be from an Önge-like source (except Önge also used a northern route entry). This means that present-day eastern non-Africans (ENA) descend primarily from a single migration wave eastwards, presumably via a route South of the Himalayas; and which possibly absorbed an earlier less successfull wave, at least regionally (Oceania and South Asia). This may also have happened via a more substructured wave: e.g. both a southern coastal route (along the coast of the Indian subcontinent) and a southern interior route (via an interior route along the southern Himalayan mountain range) into Southeast Asia and beyond. – It is however well possible that the southern coastal wave pre-dated the southern interior wave, and thus display different Denisovan signals. E.g. timely separated migrations waves of a shared clade. Regional Denisovan admixture events (or their partial absence as in the case of Jōmon HGs [see the recent paper by Jiaqi Yang et al. 2025 ""An early East Asian lineage with unexpectedly low Denisovan ancestry""]) can be explained that way, without needing several different distinct waves, which would contradict the observed genetic affinities of the different Basal Asian lineages. The low Denisovan ancestry of Jōmon hunter-gatherers may or may not be affilated with the Shiraho_27k specimen, who appearently contributed some ancestry to later Jōmon. For more information on the Shiraho_27k specimen, please contact your co-author Svante Pääbo or Hideaki Kanzawa-Kiriyama. Note that Tianyuan40k can successfully be modeled as Önge-like + IUP-affilated admixture (BachoKiro_IUP); which fits the presence of IUP material sites in nearby NW China and Mongolia. Such IUP admixture has also been noted to explain the observed affinity to the GoyetQ116-1 specimen in Europe, which similarly can be modeled as Kostenki14/Sunghir_UP + BachoKiro_IUP (see Hajdinjak et al. 2021 ""Initial Upper Palaeolithic humans in Europe had recent Neanderthal ancestry""). It is possible that this Siberian IUP group absorbed the EA-specific Denisovan component and via its admixture into Tianyuan, contributed it to other Eastern Asians in lesser amount. – Present-day East Asians in turn can be successfully modeled as Tianyuan-like (c. 25%) + Önge-like (c. 75%); (see McColl et al. 2018 ""The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia"" for example). – Via Tianyuan-like or Denisovan-admixed IUP groups, this archaic ancestry may have also reached regions further West (as with the supposed Denisovan signal in Sunghir etc.). You can also review Bennett et al. 2024 ""Reconstructing the Human Population History of East Asia through Ancient Genomics"", a recent summary paper on the peopling of Eastern Asia and beyond; as well as Tianyi Wang et al. 2025 ""Prehistoric genomes from Yunnan reveal ancestry related to Tibetans and Austroasiatic speakers"". A summary of my points regarding your postulated ""earlier southern route"" for Oceanians and a possible ""northerly route"" for East Asians: • The available genetic data strongly suggests a single shared migration wave for the primary ancestral source of all eastern non-Africans (Papuans, AASI, East Asians, Önge/Hoabinhian, and Tianyuan). The presence of multiple deeply branching EEC lineages in Southeast Asia and southern China suggest it to be a major place of diversification from a shared ancestral source. • Papuans/Oceanians (and AASI) may have limited amounts of admixture from an earlier wave, but primarily share ancestry with Önge and Tianyuan. • Tianyuan can be modeled as either an admixture between Önge-like (61–67%) and BachoKiro_IUP-like (33–39%) ancestries; or represents a deep split from the rest of eastern non-Africans; although with some geneflow into later East Asians. • Ancient and present-day East Asians can be modeled as primarily Önge-like (c. 75%) with Tianyuan-like admixture (c. 25%). • The different Denisovan introgression events, if not shared, may have happened regionally to explain the observed affinities, but the differences in Denisovan components among each group. Below some qpAdm results on this (AADR v.62 + Ranis dataset); allsnps=TRUE: Model1 target: Papuan left: Hoabinhian, ZlatyKun, Denisovan right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, BachoKiro_IUP, Tianyuan, Önge, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Hoabinhian: 93,9%; ZlatyKun: 3,2%; Denisovan: 2,9%; p-value: 0.061 Model2 target: Papuan left: Japan_Jōmon, ZlatyKun, Denisovan right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, BachoKiro_IUP, Tianyuan, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Japan_Jōmon: 94,1%; ZlatyKun: 2,4%; Denisovan: 3,5%; p-value: 0.094 Model3 target: Tianyuan left: Önge, BachoKiro_IUP right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, Oase1_IUP, Papuan, Hoabinhian, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Önge: 65,5%%; BachoKiro_IUP: 34,5%%; p-value: 0.170 Model4 target: Japan_Jōmon left: Önge, Amur33k right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, BachoKiro_IUP, Tianyuan, Papuan, Hoabinhian, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Önge: 79,0%%; Amu33k: 21,0%; p-value: 0.053 Model5 target: Han_Chinese left: Önge, Amur33k right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, BachoKiro_IUP, Tianyuan, Papuan, Hoabinhian, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Önge: 73,6%%; Amu33k: 26,4%; p-value: 0.090 Etc. (Önge = ONG Mondal; Jōmon = JpOd181/274/282). E.g. it is not likely that Oceanians were part of a distinct earlier wave into Oceania, separate from other mainland Asian groups, nor that East Asians reached East Asia along a distinct northern route (independently of Önge-like groups etc.). Next to qpAdm/qpWave or qpGraph models, f3/f4 statistics are quite clear on this. Papuans are (beyond their extra Denisovan ancestry and possible minor ""earlier group"" admixture) nested in eastern non-African diversity (e.g. EEC). It is plausible that after the OoA exit, and the IUP/EEC dispersals from a Hub on the Persian plateau, Eastern non-Africans (ENA/EEC) shared a secondary Hub somewhere in Northwest India, from which Oceanians expanded first, via a coastal route towards Oceania. Along the coast of the Indian subcontinent (South India?), they absorbed the Deep Denisovan ancestry and continued to expand to Oceania. – Some time afterwards, the remainder ENA/EEC group (residual) expanded along an interior route South of the Himalayas into Southeast Asia and Southern China; not admixing with the Deep Denisovan group. – There, one branch split and head towards Japan (low Denisovan), while another group headed northwards coming into contact with IUP groups & the EA-specific Denisovan (Denisovan3-like) component (=Tianyuan_40k); while the remainder absorbed a local Denisovan group in Southern China or Southeast Asia (=Önge-like). – This Önge-like groups expanded back into South Asia/India, absorbing the group with Deep Denisovan introgression (becoming the AASI). The Önge-like groups staying in Southeast Asia became the Hoabinhians, while early East Asians formed along a cline of Tianyuan-like and Önge-like ancestries. Of course the above scenario is just one of many possibilities; it is well possible that Oceanians used a southern route, while the ancestors of both East Asians and Önge used as northerly route. – Or any other scenario which can  explain the aDNA data and genetic affinities. My suggestion is to define a model which alignes with both aDNA data and archaic components (for ancient and present-day populations), as well as, if possible, archaeologic and paleoenvironmental evidence. E.g. including a set of ancient and present-day groups to test on their Denisovan components and their overall genetic affinities (not just modern groups to prevent bias from ancient geneflow events): For South Asians: AASI-rich tribal groups from Southern India, such as Irula and Paniya; for SEA: Önge, Hoabinhians; for EA: the newly analyzed Xingyi_EN samples, Jōmon, Longlin, Amur14k, Qihe3, Tianyuan and Amur33k, as well as present-day East/Southeas Asians; for Oceania: Papuans, Australians, and Aeta. Maybe a chart comparing shared/distinct Denisovan components and f3/f4 statistics of each test group to each other would help clarify the exact affinities, shared routes or geneflow events. Perhaps, your co-author Svante Pääbo can share informations on the Shiraho_27k specimen and its Denisovan components. A strong model should explain the genetic data/affinities of ancient/present-day populations, their different Denisovan components, and in best case also include archaeologic and paleoenvironmental data. To determine the influence of ancient geneflow, comparison between ancient specimens could help (Tianyuan vs Önge vs Jōmon vs Longlin vs Amur14k etc.). I hope this information can help to tangle out some possible scenarios on the dispersal, contact and introgression events for the different deeply branching Denisovan components and present-day Asian populations.

Neither the title nor the Abstract tells us the species under study (mice). The first mention seems to be in Methods. The Introduction does not specify the animal species used in the literature cited (mostly rats, I suppose). Some of the literature citations are erroneous. Here, I focus on two sentences, as follows. ""Nicotine is another widely abused drug that both acts on dopamine circuits and has been widely shown to decrease food intake (Iravani, 1972; Passey et al., 1961; Schechter & Cook, 1976)."" This sentence requires qualification. Any effect of nicotine on food intake will depend critically on the dose, on acute vs. chronic administration, etc. These three literature citations fail to support the above statement: Iravani 1972 exposed rats to cigarette smoke, not to nicotine per se. It is hardly surprising that the rats lost weight in this 1972 study, as they were reported to show sniffing and sneezing, with post-mortem examination revealing airways filled with ""highly purulent fluid"". It seems unlikely that this study would obtain ethical approval these days. Passey et al 1961 is from a charity campaign document, which I could not find online and is almost certainly not peer-reviewed. Schechter & Cook, 1976 actually reported the opposite of what is claimed here. This earlier study also used a very high dose of nicotine (0.8 mg/kg expressed as base). Such a dose is near the threshold for producing seizures, and would have given plasma levels of nicotine approximately 10 times higher than in smokers. There are probably dozens of solid papers that could have been cited on nicotine's effects on feeding behaviour in laboratory rats. Not all of these studies suggest that nicotine reduces food intake, especially at doses that might be smoking-relevant. ""As with amphetamine, nicotine’s effects on feeding under normal ad libitum feeding conditions has been broadly studied, but its potential effects on the rewarding and motivational qualities of food are unknown."" This is a puzzling statement. There are numerous reports of nicotine effects on operant responding for food. Are such studies not relevant?",2025-11-05T12:07:34,disqus_459cgkF2ai,Paul Clarke,,,,

Congratulations on this interesting contribution to the taxonomy and biological control of psyllid pests.

I apologise for the self-reference, but given the biogeographical proximity and the relevance of the Israeli Tamarixia fauna to the region, it was somewhat surprising not to see it cited. In Israel, we have documented five native species of Tamarixia, including T. dorchinae, which shares several morphological characters with what you describe as T. citricola, particularly in forewing and antennal structure across sexes. A comparative discussion of these taxa might offer further insights into whether the specimens from Cyprus are truly distinct species. A discussion comparing the putative new species with other taxa in the region is warranted anyway. Additionally, I think that host specificity in Tamarixia isgenerally more consistent  with psyllid host genus rather than the associated plant. This ecological pattern may be worth emphasizing in your discussion. We are in the process of barcoding the Tamarixia species of Israel, and a comparison with your material would be most useful.

Regarding the concern that FBS could be detrimental for the studies in our manuscript, the precursor frequency of FBS-reactive T cells is incredibly low. In the past, we have tested our lots of FBS in various assays (e.g., does it facilitate Treg and Tconv cell expansions and allow for suppression assays?).

All sites contested by Bruttel et al -- those differing between SARS-CoV-2 and one or more of BANAL-20-247, BANAL-20-52, and RaTG13 (Fig 3A) -- are found in closely related genomes. The opposite is expected if these sites were engineered. 2. Equivalent fingerprints can be found for both of the non-bat, SARS2-like, sarbecoviruses (pangolin viruses MP789/Guangdong and P2V/Guangxi). These are both natural genomes. 3. BsaI/BsmBI sites in SARS2 are not anomalously ""evenly spaced"" when correcting errors made by Bruttel et al and when using a more appropriate metric (coefficient of variance of fragment lengths). One obvious error is dividing 1 by 1429 to obtain 0.07%; 1429 is equal to 71*(6 + choose(6,2)) i.e., the total number of restriction maps generated and not the number ""within the ideal range of 5-7 fragments."" I also note that ""5-8"" fragments turns into ""5-7 fragments"" half way through the manuscript. Things I do not address in my new preprint that are worth noting here: 1. I did not reproduce the ""all enzymes"" analysis because this is irrelevant to the ""IVGA fingerprint"" criteria. 2. Like Bruttel et al, I did not investigate whether all sticky ends were unique when calculating significance of the site distribution. 3. I did not reproduce the analysis of mutation rates and types (last two rows of Table S2). First, this is irrelevant because it's very likely that none of these sites are mutated from the most recent common ancestor with recently sampled bat coronaviruses. Second, this is inappropriately circular analysis since the sites were already identified as being different from RaTG13 and BANAL52; of course they will have a excess concentration of differences. Third, these are not ""mutations"" because SARS-CoV-2 did not evolve from RaTG13 or BANAL52 by ""mutation"". The null hypothesis is nonsensical. I also did not address point ""f"" in the ""IVGA fingerprint"" -- ""Two unique recognition sites may flank regions meant to be further manipulated."" -- because it is based on false information. Bruttel et al wrote, falsely, that a 2017 paper reported a method ""enabling efficient manipulations of the flanking region without having to reassemble the entire viral backbone for each variant."" This is false because: 1. The substituted fragment in the 2017 paper was not flanked by BsaI sites in the resulting construct (pBAC-CMV-rWIV1); BsaI sites were not retained in the assembly. 2. There is a BsaI site in the BAC backbone (pBeloBAC11) that is retained. 3. There are 5 BsaI sites in WIV1 that were retained. There was no need to remove them because they occur in fragments that were not digested with BsaI. Of course, one-pot Golden Gate assembly protocols require removing backbone sites to combine restriction digestion and ligation into a single step; but this is not one of them since it is a modification of a previous system, Zeng et al 2016, that used BglI, SacII, and AscI.",2025-10-31T09:55:08,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.23.684102v1#comment-6789090018,biorxivstage,0,"A fundamental principle of enzyme kinetics is that the microscopic rate constants for substrate association (kf) and dissociation (kr) cannot be elucidated from steady-state data alone. The reason is that once the enzyme-substrate (ES) complex reaches a steady state, the individual forward and reverse steps of its formation become masked in the overall bulk reaction velocity. Consequently, determining kf and kr necessitates pre-steady-state kinetic measurements. This is intuitively clear when considering two hypothetical enzymes with identical kcat and kcat/Km values but different underlying kf and kr. Such enzymes would produce indistinguishable Michaelis-Menten plots (V vs. [S]), making it impossible to discriminate between their microscopic constants based on steady-state data. The authors' highly mathematical approach appears to overlook this foundational constraint. Beyond this conceptual issue, several methodological choices raise concerns regarding the biological relevance and interpretation of the simulations. 1. Violation of Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) Conditions (Page 6) The authors state that initial concentrations s0 and e0 were sampled from intervals Is=[Km/5,1.5Km] and Ie=[Km/50,0.5Km], claiming these adhere to QSSA conditions. However, a critical requirement for the standard QSSA is that the substrate concentration greatly exceeds the enzyme concentration (s0>>e0), typically by two orders of magnitude. This ensures that substrate depletion due to ES complex formation is negligible, allowing the free substrate concentration to be approximated by s0. The chosen intervals, where e0 can be as high as 2.5 times s0 (e.g., s0=0.2Km and e0=0.5Km), severely violate this condition. Therefore, the subsequent simulations and analyses do not accurately model a conventional steady-state experiment, where the QSSA is valid. 2. Unrealistic Kinetic Parameters and Confounded Results (Page 8) In the sensitivity analysis, the authors compare two scenarios: •	(i)   kf=0.500 nM−1s−1, kr=0.005 s−1 •	(ii)  kf=0.005 nM−1s−1, kr=0.500 s−1 The ratio kr/kf defines the dissociation constant (Kd). For scenario (i), Kd=10 pM, representing an exceptionally tight, nearly irreversible binding event that is thermodynamically implausible for a productive enzyme-catalyzed reaction. In contrast, scenario (ii) has a more reasonable Kd of 10 µM. More critically, these scenarios are again simulated with e0 comparable to s0, invalidating the QSSA. Furthermore, the two parameter sets result in different Km values (approximately 10 nM and 300 nM, respectively). The different substrate decay curves shown in Figure 1 are therefore a direct result of different enzyme saturation levels (s0/Km ratios), not a unique sensitivity to kr. If the simulations were repeated with identical s0/Km ratios and appropriately scaled timeframes, the substrate decay profiles would be indistinguishable. This confounding factor also explains the reported low sensitivity to kr: when kr<<kcat, the value of Km becomes insensitive to changes in kr. Conclusion In summary, this work does not demonstrate that microscopic rate constants kf and kr can be derived from steady-state parameters Km and kcat. The simulations were conducted under conditions that violate the assumptions of Michaelis-Menten model, and the presented results appear to be confounded by differences in enzyme saturation.

Monovalent siRNA was mentioned multiple times, which was confusing because the project is focused on divalent siRNAs. There were many times where it said to “see above” but it was unclear where to look. In addition, Figure 1 is unclear and needs additional labeling. The text says Chol-TEG s1 is monovalent, but that is not indicated in the figure.

The section expanded screen for potent human siRNA sequences, discusses cell death but did not explain the technique used and why the authors chose that technique. For example, it was described as “any wells with cell death or rounded cells were noted.” Clarification on how authors determined if the cells underwent cell death or if they were rounded is needed. In addition, the generated mouse line description is unclear. Are the C57BL/6 mice replaced with human locus? The generation of the mice used for the experiments is not described sufficiently. Specifically, the transgenic mice were back crossed until generation 5; however, the following section discussed using generation 3 and 6 for transgene mapping. Furthermore, how much murine DNA was removed and how much human DNA was inserted? Is it the same chromosomal location? In addition, there needs to be a better explanation on how the targeted siRNA dose levels were chosen, simply saying “determined by UV absorbance” is not enough. The administration of divalent siRNA to mice was unclear. Why were two different types of anesthesia used? The statement “this procedure was performed first on the right and then on the left” needs to be explained.  A figure detailing the procedure would help.

Using fetal bovine serum in human pancreatic tissue slice cultures introduces xenogeneic components that compromise physiological relevance. Human cells are exposed to bovine proteins, immunoglobulins, cytokines, and growth factors they would never encounter in vivo. This is especially concerning for immune cell studies, where bovine mediators may inappropriately activate or suppress human macrophages and T cells, producing non-physiological responses. Species differences in growth factor-receptor interactions can alter signaling pathways and gene expression, creating artifacts that don't reflect authentic human biology. For mechanistic studies and therapeutic evaluations, maintaining species-appropriate culture conditions is critical.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.14.594221v1#comment-6785383363,biorxivstage,0,"This study by Bento et. al (2024) revealed that both Anopheles mosquitoes and plasmodium parasites are influenced by rhythms that have evolved to synchronize in order to optimize infection and transmission timing within the hole. Researchers asked whether the biological clocks helped the organism anticipate blood meals and modulate, parasite behavior, which would ultimately affect malaria transmission. There are three primary findings in this paper. The first finding was that roughly half of the mosquito salivary gland transcriptome exhibit 24 hour rhythmic expression. The expression peaks occurred twice daily once early in the day and once early in the night, which alliance with the gnome mosquito feeding patterns. These changes persist in both light/dark (LD) and constant darkness (DD) conditions. This was an indication that the genes in the salivary glands were driven by an internal circadian clock rather than by light cues or environmental factors. The second finding is that the Plasmodium sporozoite in the salivary gland also show cyclic transcription, that included cells involved in motility and host cell invasion. The authors ruled out the possibility that the observed rhythmic expression could be due to changes in sporozoite numbers due to replication or migration. After using immunofluorescence to visualize sporozoites at specific time points and testing for DNA replication, they found no evidence that replication explained the cyclic patterns. These results strengthened to idea that both mosquito and parasite are synchronized by daily cycles. Lastly, the found that mosquitoes are more likely feed at night and ingest more blood. Mice infected with sporozoites at night show higher liver parasites loads than mice infected during the day, indicating that sporozoites more infective at night. Together, these results suggest that the mammalian host, Plasmodium parasite and the Anopheles mosquito have evolved coordinated daily rhythms that maximize transmission success. The paper’s central contribution is the discovery that both the Anopheles mosquito vector and the Plasmodium parasite operate under circadian control and that their biological rhythms are synchronized to optimize malaria transmission. A critique that I would give to the main contribution is that experiments use Anopheles mosquitoes and Plasmodium berghei (a rodent malaria model). While appropriate for a controlled lab setting, it does not fully represent human malaria species or the natural mosquito environment. Conducting similar experiment in the future on human malaria parasites and field collected mosquitoes would strength relevance to the human population. If I were to write the significance of the paper on a 1-5 scale, I would give it a 4. It provides an important discovery with clear implication for control strategies. Overall, the methodology is mostly convincing. The researchers sampling every 4 hours, replication cross LD and DD conditions and combined transcriptomic and proteomic approaches provide a strong support for the presence of rhythmic gene expression. However, I have some questions about the results. The paper shows differences in expression levels between LD and DD conditions. What explains the discrepancies. This study would benefit from more discussion or experiments that addressed the source of LD and DD differences. Also, not all genes within the sporozoite showed clean cyclic patterns. For example, p52, CS, and AMA-1, displayed irregular or weak oscillations. It would be helpful if the authors addressed whether their irregulars reflect true biological variability or something external among the sporozoites. Also, a direct manipulation of clock components would strength the link between salivary gland genes and sporozoites. The most important limitation is generalizability. This study’s experiments focused on rodent-parasite/mosquito system under controlled conditions. This makes it unclear whether the observed data of rhythmic gene expression operates identically in natural setting with human malaria species and diverse mosquito environments. I would rate the writing 3/5 for clarity. The method’s section was dense and difficult to follow in some parts. There were technical terms and procedural details that were not fully explained for a non-specialist reader. For example. algorithms were named (e.g., ARSER, JTK_CYCLE), but a brief, plain-language description of what each contributes would help readers unfamiliar with circadian statistics. Also, some of the figures lacked proper labeling so it as hard to interpret what the data without having to refer back to the paper.  However, the abstract, introduction, results and discussion were readable and logically organized. Overall, the paper reframes malaria as a time-dependent system in which the vector, parasite and host rhythms are important for infection and transmission. Practical implication includes creating strategies that uses this knowledge such as insecticide spraying, bed-net use or prophylactic drug delivery to disrupt transmission timing. Moreover, this study can extend to other vector-borne disease such as Zika and dengue. Ultimately, this research contributes to the growing appreciation that temporal organization is central to biological function.",2025-10-21T05:01:38,beatrice_opoku,Beatrice Opoku,,,,

This could help make some of the figures’ details easier to distinguish and make your research more accessible to a wider audience. Thank you again for such an interesting and wonderful read!",2025-10-21T02:49:40,karenachu,Karena Chu,,,,

I found the logical flow of the experiments quite smooth and elegant, starting with mosquitoes and the parasites and finally the hosts, as well as using the methods of sequencing and behavioural studies. I also appreciated the comprehensive approach that connects the efficiency of malaria transmission to the genetic and behavioural aspects between the host, vector and parasite. I particularly liked how you incorporated both mRNA sequencing and proteomic analyses to strengthen your conclusions, though it might help to clarify some figures (e.g., clearer axis labeling in hierarchical clustering and heat maps, discussing patterns in heat maps) and discuss potential experimental limitations, such as the frequency of proteomic sampling and how experimental settings, such as the single-bloodmeal design differs from natural conditions. Overall, this is an innovative piece of work which sets a foundation for future circadian and malaria studies.",2025-10-21T02:08:44,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,,,,

Your work provides remarkable insight into how circadian rhythms influence malaria transmission, connecting parasite, vector, and host biology in a way that could reshape how we think about disease timing and control strategies. One question I have is regarding the difference in the number of peaks and the timing of peak expression activity between the mosquitoes and the sporozoites shown in fig. 1F and fig. 3C. I’m interested in what you make of the discrepancy. Why might it be advantageous for sporozoites to have a peak expression in the early morning while most of the Anopheles activity occurs. The fact that the peak expressions are synched between the sporozoites suggests that they are synched by external stimulus. However, for an immature parasite that likely lacks photoreceptors and was raised under constant temperature, I’m really curious what type of stimulus could affix or synchronize its circadian rhythm. I really enjoyed reading this thought-provoking piece of work.",2025-10-21T02:02:37,fumingmeng,Fuming Meng,,,,

The study also highlights RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) as potential key regulators of developmental gene expression changes in T. cruzi. The main contribution is the creation of the first comprehensive scRNA-seq atlas of T. cruzi, which provides a high-quality resource for understanding life cycle transitions. This dataset provides a foundational reference that future studies can use to build new RNA-seq experiments and explore regulatory mechanisms in parasite development. The primary limitation is that the study is descriptive rather than mechanistic. The authors identify candidate regulators and stage-specific genes but do not experimentally test their functional roles, leaving relationships unproven. Overall, this is a technically strong and biologically revealing preprint that significantly advances the research field of the life cycle of the T. cruzi. Despite some limitations in experimental validation, the dataset’s scale, quality, and analytical depth make it a valuable work.",2025-10-21T01:25:51,josieqiao,Josie Qiao,,,,

First, the authors nicely identified the key mechanism of attenuation — an early and strong IFN-α response that limits measles virus replication. I also like how they combined in vivo and in vitro experiments, which makes the findings much more convincing. And finally, the study not only explains why the measles vaccine is safe and long-lasting, but also gives useful insights for designing new live or IFN-sensitive vaccine platforms. That said, there are still a few details that could be improved. For example, in Figure 1a–b, it’s not very clear why the authors only used TECs and PBMCs as models instead of including other cell types. It’s also not explained why they only collected the supernatant from TECs but measured both the supernatant and cell fractions in PBMCs. In Figure 4, the macaque experiment only shows viral RNA and cytokine changes in BAL and PBMCs, but lacks tissue-level analysis like immune cell infiltration or histology. Lastly, the study doesn’t really discuss the adaptive immune response, which is important since long-term immune memory is a major feature of the measles vaccine. Overall, I think it’s an excellent paper with strong data and meaningful findings, but there are still some details that could be clarified or expanded to make it even stronger.",2025-10-21T00:06:41,,CDSL comment,,,,

Using large-scale manipulative experiments across eleven German beech forest sites and sophisticated coverage-standardized analyses with Hill numbers, the authors demonstrate that structural diversification can actually reduce local and landscape-scale spider diversity through strong habitat filtering, even though species turnover slightly increases. The integration of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic dimensions provides a comprehensive picture of how community assembly responds to silvicultural heterogenization. Overall, this work offers important insights into the scale-dependent and taxon-specific consequences of forest management and reminds ecologists that complexity does not universally translate into higher diversity.",2025-10-21T00:00:43,disqus_NEbHzZLOFe,Eason,,,,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.29.673149v1#comment-6785299631,biorxivstage,0,"Thank you for your excellent work in the important ecological field of temperate forest heterogeneity and its impact on spider diversity.  This is a surprising and interesting finding that structural heterogeneity increases β diversity but decreases γ and α diversity. Your large-scale and rigorous experimental design provides solid support for your results, and I think it can potentially guide the ecological management of modern forestry. However, to fully maximize the value of your research, I think you can have deeper interpretation of your results. For example, you can provide an analysis of key heterogeneity indicators such as deadwood type and the presence/absence of gaps in ESBC district. I also suggest that you can emphasise the significance and impact of your research more in the discussion part. The paper's overall logical flow is clear, and the writing is fluent. Although some technical terms make it difficult for readers without an ecological background to read, I consider this a good article.
