However, it should be noted that the relationship between genotype and phenotype isn’t fully understood. Also, we know from other ancient DNA studies that the derived alleles in genes SLC24A5 and SLC45A2 associated with light skin pigmentation in Europeans today were either fixed or at high frequency in the Neolithic Anatolian population. Previous studies have linked the introduction of light skin in western, central and southern Europe as coming with the Neolithic Anatolian farmers. Eastern hunter-gatherers seem to have carried these alleles already, so Eastern Europe and Scandinavia followed a different trend. Your method predicted darker skin in the Neolithic Anatolians based on genomes that have already been published, which contradicts the original research, but you ignored this in your paper. The earlier findings need to be taken into consideration here - why does your method contradict these findings? And if you deem your method superior, then how and when did these alleles get introduced in western/southern Europe if it wasn’t with the Anatolian farmers? And why did your method predict darker skin pigmentation in this population when they carried the same derived alleles as modern Europeans?",2025-04-08T12:36:14,,MM,10.1101/2025.01.29.635495,Inference of human pigmentation from ancient DNA by genotype likelihood,"Silvia Perretti, Maria Teresa Vizzari, Patrícia Santos, Enrico Tassani, Andrea Benazzo, Silvia Ghirotto, Guido Barbujani",2025-02-12

Promega also conveniently doesn't mention that the readily available and cheaper bis-CTZ can be used with Nanoluc with very similar results (though, Satoshi Inouye had reported this in 2013). For years, I've been asking around in the bioluminescence if someone has determined it but no one did. Eventually, I've realized that I can simply determine it from absorbance. ""When you understand the laws of physics, anything is possible"" #TBBT. 🎆 All the four compounds (CTZ, bis-CTZ, CTZ-h, frZ) and many other cœlenterazine-derived compounds have the same core set of conjugated double bonds which gives them an absorbance peak around 425-440 nm and, hence, a yellow color: see the linked slide with spectra of CTZ, bis-CTZ and furimazine. So, it seems that one can safely use the same molar absorption coefficient for all of them. I like to use ε=10000 L/(mol⋅cm) in ethanol (or methanol) since batches of CTZ and bis-CTZ of high purity can slightly exceed this value according to their certificates of analysis (see the linked image). The furimazine solution in the spectra illustration was diluted from the N1110 reagent stock (catalog # N113A tube in this kit) For Promega reagents, such measurements give 3.42 mM furimazine for the "" Nano-Glo® Luciferase Assay System"" ( catalog # N1110 - used in this preprint) and 0.58 mM furimazine for the "" Nano-Glo® Live Cell Assay System"" ( catalog # N2011). So, the 1:500 dilution is 6.8 μM furimazine, 1:1000 - 3.4 μM, 1:100 dilution is 34 μM furimazine.",2025-04-07T01:00:17,michaelkoksharov,Misha Koksharov,10.1101/2023.06.25.546478,CaBLAM!

I'll use it for my current NFF project on pathways towards the GBF targets. I missed an important, additional reference though, which is the IPBES, 2023 document on zenodo. https://zenodo.org/records/8171339 It is an IPBES document, with the plenary approved description of the NFF and it's official figure (which has been modified since Pereira 2020) as well as a 1st version methodological guidance on using the NFF. I especially wanted to point out this reference, since your figure 5 is graphically so extremely similar to the approved NFF figure, but without reference to this document. That is either a coincidence, in which case to avoid confusion I'd suggest seeing how to make the two more dissimilar since conceptually they are different. Or on purpose, in which case I think adding 'adapted from IPBES, 2023' is appropriate. Happy to discuss if needed.

The work is of great relevance in the field of extracellular vesicles (EVs), as it explores the role of the SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) pathway in the packaging of post-translational proteins in these structures. The data corroborate other studies that seek to understand the packaging mechanisms of extracellular vesicles that can influence the function of vesicles and, consequently, their interaction with target cells, such as in astrocytes, enriching the knowledge of how these pathways are involved in the construction of EVs and modifications, in this case protein modifications. One detail that caught my attention was the terms used and I would like to comment on a few things: Extracellular vesicles are complex structures that carry information in cellular communication, being responsible for the exchange of molecules between cells, including proteins, lipids, and genetic material. Their function in cellular communication depends on the specific composition of each vesicle, which can vary depending on the type of cell that releases it, for example in the modulation of biological processes, such as the immune response. In addition, the field of study with EV is being increasingly explored, precisely because these small structures are mediators in such important functions in target cells 1,2. However, it is still an area that is expanding and many terms, nomenclatures, and methodologies are still being discussed. Therefore, the use of more general terms involving location, group, and nomenclatures can be strategic to avoid having data invalidated in the future. For example, today the nomenclature “microvesicles” has been invalidated, “exosomes” discouraged and “extracellular vesicles” is well accepted according to MISEV (Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles)3. Another suggestion is to be cautious when declaring the position of the components of these structures if there is no data presented that confirms whether it is inside, on the surface or if it is transmembrane in these released structures. I suggest that the authors perform an assay that really shows the location of the protein. The viability data should be presented in a graph to support the integrity of the extracellular vesicles obtained. Another control that I believe should be incorporated is the graph of the populations (size and quantity) by NTA obtained from a portion of the sample of extracellular vesicles used in the functional assay, with the corresponding results. Thus, the quantity of extracellular vesicles used can be calculated and also corroborates that the quantity of vesicles does not interfere with the effect on astrocytes, but rather on the proteins involved in SUMOylation. Finally, when performing functional assays with extracellular vesicles, it is important to incorporate rigorous controls to validate the results. The viability of the cells subjected to vesiculation can also be assessed using rezasurin, and data on the size and quantity of EVs can be presented using NTA (Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis) graphs to ensure that the samples used in the functional assays followed a methodology for good purification and preservation of the integrity of these vesicles. Since storage at -80°C can compromise the bilayer of the EV membrane, the results obtained for size and quantity may change, as well as the form of communication with the target cell of the assay. Immunofluorescence assays can complement the data and elucidate how these EVs interact with the target cell: membrane-membrane contact, fusion between membranes or internalization of these structures. These controls will allow a more accurate assessment of EV functionality and contribute to the understanding of their mechanisms of action. In addition, they can also open new research possibilities, such as the evaluation of the impact of EVs formed by the SUMO pathway in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, where cellular communication and protein accumulation play key roles in disease progression. Studies in the literature mention disease progression related to the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein and other factors still under investigation, such as changes in the protein profile and receptors of microglia.

DHRS7 Integrates NADP+ 1 /NADPH Redox Sensing with Inflammatory Li2 pid Signalling via the Oxoeicosanoid Pathway Yanan Ma1 , King Lam Hui1 , Yohannes A. Ambaw1 , Tobias C. Walther1,3 3 , Robert V. Farese, Jr1 , Miklos Lengyel1 , Zaza Gelashvili1,2 , Dajun Lu1 , and Philipp Niethammer1,4 Reviewer Team: Lucas Athayde, Rosangela Silva Santos, Sara Ventura. Summary Employing a variety of methodological approaches including structural modeling, phylogenetics, gene silencing, and mass spectrometry, the authors investigate 5- HEDH activity in A549 cells, an enzyme associated with lipid dehydrogenation that leads to 5-KETE formation. After confirming 5-HEDH activity through detection of its reversible oxidation products, 5-KETE and 5-HETE, the study proceeds with a gene-level investigation and screening for potential microsomal dehydrogenases involved in this lipid peroxidation. Additionally, the authors provide insights that may extend to other types of cells, as evidenced by functional studies in zebrafish. The authors uncover the role of DHRS7 in redox signaling, demonstrating its NADPH-dependent regulation of 5-KETE production. Unlike classical redox signaling based on thiol oxidation, they present DHRS7 as a redox-regulated enzyme that acts in 5-KETE biosynthesis, which is a highly novel and interesting mechanism. Under stress conditions, DHRS7 facilitates rapid inflammatory signaling and leukocyte recruitment through the 5-KETE pathway. Major Comments Identification of DHRS7 as a 5-HEDH Candidate The screening successfully identified DHRS7 as a candidate enzyme with 5- HEDH activity. LC-MS profiling of wild-type cell lines revealed increased 5-KETE levels in cells exposed to 5-HEDE and vice versa, with a stronger effect observed in 5-KETE accumulation. Surprisingly, 5-KETE production appeared to be favored under non-stress conditions. We would like to see a description of the data normalization to exclude the possibility that these differences arise from variations in cell viability, abundance, or any other experimental conditions. Alternative Pathways and Metabolic Compensation Another observation is the reduction in 5-KETE and 5-HETE levels in DHRS7 knockout cells, corroborating the proposed DHRS7 role. But the persistence of these metabolites in silenced cells even at lower concentrations is curious, which leads to a few hypotheses such as the activation of endogenous compensatory mechanisms and exogenous uptake of these metabolites from the media. To further investigate the origin of these residual metabolite levels, it is essential to quantify 5-KETE and 5-HETE in the culture medium to test if the cells' knockouts exposure to these lipids could explain these residual levels. To evaluate if these residual metabolites could have originated from endogenous mechanisms, a transcriptome analysis could be used to identify other redox-active enzymes differentially expressed that could exhibit potential 5-HEDH activity thereby compensating DHRS7 silencing. Subcellular Localization of DHRS7 The authors employed GFP-tagged DHRS7 constructs for subcellular localization and genetic complementation assays in DHRS7 KO A549 cells and zebrafish Dhrs7 KO models. This strategy successfully restored the wild-type phenotype, as evidenced by increased 5-HETE and 5-KETE levels upon treatment with precursors, corroborating the initial hypothesis of DRS7 as a 5-HEDH. However, the conclusion that DHRS7 localizes to microsomes lacks experimental validation, as no microsomal markers were used in confocal imaging. Indeed, cellular fractionation and Western blot assays indicate DHRS7 also localized in the nucleus, granules, and microsomes, but GFP fluorescence was absent in the nucleus. Given that the antibody used for Western blotting was available, it’s not clear why the authors did not employ an anti-DHRS7 antibody for immunofluorescence to precisely determine its intracellular distribution rather than relying on GFP-based localization assays. Kinetic Characterization of DHRS7 Activity The authors conducted enzymatic kinetics assays for DHRS7 and applied a Michaelis-Menten model for data fitting. However, the fitting shows clear deviations, with a notably low coefficient of determination (R²), suggesting that this model may not adequately describe DHRS7’s catalytic properties. In fact, a typical Michaelian model does not appear to fit the data distribution. To ensure that these discrepancies are not due to experimental artifacts, we recommend repeat the experiments performing additional replicates. Furthermore, considering the probable reversibility of 5-KETE conversion, alternative kinetic models that account for this factor should be explored. Minor Comments ● Lines 13-15: The authors state, ""As the DHRS7 (but not DHRS3) knockdown effect was consistent with 5-HEDH activity, we tested whether DHRS7 also promoted 5-KETE reduction. This was the case."" However, Figure S1D shows a reduction in 5-HETE, not 5-KETE. More clarification is needed. ● Cell Line Justification: The authors discuss DHRS7 expression in various contexts but do not justify their choice of A549 cells. Since none of the cited references mention DHRS7 expression in this line, a description of the rationale for model choice is necessary. ● Figure 1E: We recommend a dose-time response curve for DOX treatment to monitor DHRS7 expression levels. This would determine if DHRS7 expression remains at physiological levels or becomes supraphysiological, thereby ensuring that subsequent treatments also occur under physiological conditions. ● Figure 1F: We recommend a more clear description that these are cells lacking the DHRS7 construct to enhance reader understanding. ● Figure 2B: H₂O₂ is not a direct intermediate in the 5-HETE/5-KETE pathway, though it may indirectly influence it by activating 5-LOX, altering redox balance (NADP⁺/NADPH), and contributing to ferroptosis. The statement ""Lipid peroxidation stimulates 5-KETE production through DHRS7"" would be more robust if 5-LOX activity was assessed. We suggest a validation experiment: Treat DOX-induced DHRS7-expressing cells with H₂O₂ and measure markers of lipid peroxidation, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), isoprostanes, or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). This would confirm lipid peroxidation’s role in 5-KETE production. ● Figure 3D: Overexpression methodology in HEK cells is unclear. The knockout was achieved using CRISPR/Cas9, not shRNA. More clarification is needed on whether overexpression was introduced via a separate construct post-knockout, whether a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) or DOX-inducible system was used, or if overexpression was performed in a different cell line. ● Figure 4A: The heatmap visualization of metabolite concentrations was clear, but cluster analysis would provide more information related to the significance of observed alterations.",2025-03-24T20:40:02,,"Sara, Rosangela e Lucas",10.1101/2025.02.05.636725,DHRS7 Integrates NADP+/NADPH Redox Sensing with Inflammatory Lipid Signalling via the Oxoeicosanoid Pathway,"Yanan Ma, King Lam Hui, Yohannes A.

Since the publication of this genetically encoded sensor-based image analysis program (or GESIAP2.0) on bioRxiv in 2022 (Zheng et al., 2022), we have received extensive feedback from collaborators, colleagues, and reviewers—some of whom commented and reviewed our manuscripts that utilized GESIAP to analyze synaptic properties (Huang et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025b).  This feedback has been instrumental in identifying several limitations associated with GESIAP2.0.  Fortunately, these issues have been resolved in the latest version, GESIAP3.0, which incorporates algorithms independently developed by Roger Zhu and colleagues at Zhejiang University (Zhu et al., 2024). One limitation of GESIAP2.0 concerns the initial movement correction procedure. GESIAP2.0 employs translational (or affine) alignment algorithms to correct movements in fluorescence signals collected from ex vivo imaging experiments (Zheng et al., 2022).  While effective for minor displacements, this method struggles with larger movements, leading to the exclusion of many cells from analysis.  GESIAP3.0 incorporates an advanced non-rigid movement correction algorithm that corrects complex displacements in behaving animals, as well as small movements in ex vivo experiments (Zhu et al., 2024).  Recent tests show that this algorithm eliminates the need for alignment, improving the robustness and accuracy of the image analysis. Both GESAIP2.0 (Zheng et al., 2022) and GESAIP3.0 (Zhu et al., 2024) utilize the Landweber deconvolution procedure (Sage et al., 2017), a published method that enhances microscopic image quality by ""reassigning"" detected photons to their original emitting locations in both ex vivo and in vivo experiments. Another notable limitation of GESIAP2.0 is the denoising procedure.  Initially, GESIAP2.0 used a non-synaptic function to fit fluorescence responses (Zheng et al., 2022). This method proved ineffective in accurately identifying key parameters of fluorescence responses, including latency and peak.  This method often failed to detect small fluorescence responses from noise background, resulting in an underestimation of releasing synapses (Zheng et al., 2022).  Roger Zhu later introduced a double-exponential synaptic function to improve fitting, but its high computational demands prevented its application to all data in the preprint (Zheng et al., 2022).  In GESIAP3.0, Roger Zhu and his Zhejiang University team implemented a least-squares non-linear optimization using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to fit double-exponential synaptic function (Zhu et al., 2024).  This  method combines gradient descent with the Gauss-Newton method (Moré, 2006; Gavin, 2019), fitting both the rise and decay phases of synaptic responses to optimize parameter regression.  Biological constraints based on the response properties of genetically encoded sensors (e.g., (Borden et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2021)) were also incorporated to restrict parameter ranges, improving both speed and accuracy. The final step in GESIAP2.0 is flawed (Zheng et al., 2022).  To amplify small signals extracted during denoising, baseline responses are arbitrarily subtracted, introducing random variations in the fluorescence responses.  In contrast, GESIAP3.0 improves small signal extraction using double-exponential synaptic function fitting (Zhu et al., 2024).  When necessary, it further reduces residual noise with a bilateral non-linear filter (Tomasi and Manduchi, 1998), enhancing image clarity without inflating fluorescence ΔF/F0 values. In summary, GESIAP2.0 (Zheng et al., 2022) provides further proof-of-principle that nanoscopic sensor-based functional imaging analysis can dissect synaptic properties of transmission across various transmitters, cell types, and animal species (cf. (Zhu et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021)).  This analysis also implies both shared patterns and a diverse range of presynaptic release dynamics that contribute to neuromodulation.  However, code defects in GESIAP2.0 lead to inaccurate estimates of synaptic properties, limiting its ability to address fundamental biological questions.  Our new manuscripts show that synaptic properties calculated using GESIAP3.0 (Huang et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025b) differ significantly from those obtained with GESIAP2.0 and align closely with results from independent approaches.  Hence, we encourage readers to contact the Zhejiang University team for potential collaborations and access to the GESIAP3.0 code. - J.
