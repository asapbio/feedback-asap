The only significant difference between them is that I4290 is lower coverage. I suspect that this, coupled with your use of the very low quality Iran_Mesolithic_BeltCave in the outgroups, might be the problem in your qpAdm analysis. I4290 and I4210 appear to be very similar in all of the PCA, qpAdm and ADMIXTURE analyses that I've done. Indeed, they're close to each other in all of my PCA, including across many different dimensions, except of course the PCA that reflect different levels of coverage in the samples being run. For instance, here's a PCA that looks specifically at differences in South Asian and Anatolian genetic affinities. As you can see, there's practically no difference between I4290 and I4210. https://blogger.googleuserc... It is possible that I4290 and I4210 both have some sort of minor South Asian-related ancestry, but if so, then this type of low level South Asian-related admixture was ubiquitous in Eneolithic/Chalcolithic Central Asia.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.17.567578v1#comment-6396779299,biorxivstage,0,"Summary: Fusidic acid (FA) and its derivative fusidic acid cyclopentane (FA-CP) are antibiotics administered to treat Staphylococcus aureus (SA) infections. Previous studies have established that FA acts by impeding release of elongation factor G (EF-G) from the ribosome, thereby inhibiting translation. However, because previous structures of FA bound to ribosome have been solved from Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to FA, our understanding of precisely how FA acts on Gram-positive species like Staphylococcus aureus and how resistance arises is incomplete. In this paper, the authors solve cryo-EM structures of FA- and FA-CP bound ribosomes from Staphylococcus aureus to understand their interactions with the ribosome in a native Gram-positive environment and put previously observed resistance mutants in context.The major success of this paper is its development of a structural rationale for previously observed FA-resistant mutants, and development of a structural basis for improved FA derivatives. Additionally, the authors found novel posttranscriptional modifications within the SA ribosome. The major weakness of this paper is in validation of these novel rRNA modifications. In conjunction with FA-bound Gram-negative ribosomes, these structures are important for defining the core interactions that mediate FA resistance, which could also help to enumerate the space of possible future resistant mutants. Major points: Given the high level of sequence conservation in ribosomes across different bacterial species, it would be informative to explain the benefits of investigating ribosomes specifically from S. aureus. Are the FA binding site and EF-G in S. aureus distinct from the FA binding site and EF-G in bacteria used in previous structural studies of FA-bound ribosomes? Or is there something unique about S. aureus physiology and its development of antibiotic resistance? Providing a specific explanation, perhaps by citing what previous studies in the field have not captured or providing sequence conservation metrics, would emphasize the novelty of these structures and how they contribute to our understanding of FA resistance. “The CHI state is the most abundant in our sample, and only a minor population is in POST state. In the FA data, 60% of the ribosomes are bound to EF-G, and 93% of those are in CHI state. In the FA-CP data, 72% of the 70S particles contain EF-G, out of which 88% are in CHI state.” Would an S. aureus ribosome dataset with EF-G bound but no FA in the sample have no detectable POST population? A comparison to EF-G bound with no FA in the sample would also strengthen the claim “In our data, however, we do observe POST state, indicating that FA inhibition allows time for the SSU head to back-swivel in presence of EF-G.” Before making claims about how FA changes the landscape of EF-G bound-ribosome conformations, it would be helpful for readers to understand the initial landscape of EF-G bound-ribosome with no FA – perhaps explaining observations from previous studies would help with this. In Figure 4, any differences in hydrogen bonding or other FA interactions between the three different structures should be highlighted (or lack thereof should be mentioned). Although the text describes different rotamers and positions of switch II and residues like R464, it is unclear to us how that impacts FA binding interactions. In Figure 5, the explanation of resistance mutations would be clearer if there were a side-by-side diagram of what interactions are present in a FA-susceptible ribosome vs FA-resistant mutant, as opposed to simply highlighting all the affected residues. As is, Figure 5 is unclear about whether multiple mutations are required to confer resistance or if each residue individually confers resistance, and the relative increase in resistance that each mutation confers. Discussion of how these mutations rationalize previously observed resistance on a structural level, and whether this structure can also rationalize the degree to which they confer resistance, would be helpful. Furthermore, we are curious how the FA-CP analog corresponds to these mutations – does the structure rationalize FA-CP resistant mutants as well? An additional figure in the style of Figure 5 but with FA-CP, showing FA-CP resistant mutants from previous studies, would further show how this structure can provide a basis for understanding resistance mutants. For the rRNA modifications observed in Figure 6: We are curious whether these modifications could be related to EF-G, fusidic acid, fusidic acid cyclopentane interactions and relevant resistance mutations. Speculation in the discussion about possible consequences of these modifications, resistance-related or not, would be helpful for readers to understand why these modifications are important. The authors showed the single modifications in Figure 6, but perhaps a few supplemental figures showing how the modifications interact with functionally important parts (i.e. decoding center and peptidyl transferase center) of the ribosome would be helpful for reader comprehension. Since FA-CP was tested against S. aureus ATCC 29213 in Garcia Chavez et. al. 2021 (reference #28), but the ribosomes in this paper are from S. aureus NCTC 8325-4, we are also curious if these rRNA modifications are general to all S. aureus ribosomes or if there is some strain-specific modification. The authors made their conclusions about novelty based on their map in comparison to E. coli rRNA modifications. These modifications could also be compared to other S. aureus ribosomal structures instead of the E. coli structures. Additionally, for further investigation of the cryoEM density itself, there are programs such as qPTxM or Curiosity (both of which can be found at https://github.com/irisdyoung) that could help validate that the modification is present and clarify any heterogeneity in the density. Validation by mass spectrometry or other experimental techniques would also increase confidence in the model. Minor points: In Figure S4, it would be helpful to show the hydrogen bonds or other interactions that lock switch II in place. Regarding this sentence, “ The other is an intermediate so-called chimeric hybrid state (CHI) of translocation, in which the head of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) remains swiveled and tRNAs make A- and P-site interactions with the mRNA codon and the SSU head, but P- and E-site interactions with the 30S body and the 50S (12, 18).” It was not clear as to what the authors meant after the word but.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.19.572389v1#comment-6396738752,biorxivstage,1,"In a previous paper, the authors expressed fragments of peptides to identify sequences that would act as “dominant negative” inhibitors of the parent protein. However, screening peptides for inhibitory effects in cells by bulk competition and deep sequencing has limitations. Due to their limited size, peptides can potentially have multiple non-specific or off-target consequences such as multiple target binding, cytotoxicity, or non-specific binding to the target protein of interest. Validating that a peptide is a true inhibitor is critical, however, determining the mechanism of inhibition across multiple fragment sequences can be very time consuming. Genetically this could be done testing fragments in overexpressed target protein backgrounds to help confirm that the interaction between a given fragment and the desired target is due to target inhibition but, for libraries of fragments, a more high throughput method would be desirable.  While in some cases (such as with GroEL and GroES) the authors inferred that the inhibitory effect of fragments were specific interactions due to the concentration of the target protein (i.e. correlation between higher expression of target and inhibition), the mechanisms of inhibition for several proteins were not definitively proven to occur through native interactions which leaves an open question as to whether these fragments are true inhibitors. Here they develop a computational screen to increase the confidence that inhibitory peptides work via the desired on-target mechanism, the authors have now developed a computational tool that is built upon AlphaFold called FragFold. FragFold structurally predicts the fragment bound to the target protein, with inhibitory fragments identified experimentally having a predicted high number of contacts between fragment and target. The major strength of this paper is in developing a method that could be used to identify regions of proteins that are involved in PPI’s based on evolutionarily related sequences that recapitulate the native binding interfaces. The major weakness of this paper is that the underlying method of MSA concatenation is not clearly explained (see Major point 1). Why is the discontinuous unpaired strategy optimal relative to other AlphaFold-multimer-like strategies? Overall, the paper demonstrates the power of AlphaFold to closely recapitulate the structures of experimentally determined fragment binding interfaces by working exclusively in sequence space in a high-throughput manner. Further, in the absence of experimental structures, the authors present plausible AlphaFold predictions of fragment bound structures that are supported by biochemical and genetic data which could further contribute to the utility of this method in studying known PPI’s. There are a few points we would like to bring to the attention of the authors to strengthen the manuscript further. Major points: 1) The authors state that they generated multiple sequence alignments for both the fragments and target protein prior to running AlphaFold2 to minimize computation time. Although it is not clearly explained, the authors claim they concatenated these two MSA’s into a single MSA. We interpret this to mean that the input MSA’s were not directly pairing the fragment sequences to the target sequences but leaving either side of the fragment sequence and the target sequence blank to force AlphaFold to co-predict the structure of the fragment with the target protein by treating it as a single discontinuous sequence. While we were surprised by the simplicity of this method and the ability to remain in sequence space based on evolutionary similarity of fragment and target protein sequences, there are several questions we have regarding this implementation. From the explanation provided with figure 1A, the fragment sequence appears to be directly paired to the target sequence, however in fig 1B the method appears to work by using the evolutionary information of many orthologs and related proteins of both fragment and target to co-predict their structures using a discontinuous input sequence. Is this correct? Could the authors provide a clearer description of how they are concatenating the MSA’s? We were also curious to know how different concatenation strategies affect the accuracy of predictions. For example, could the authors also try concatenating directly paired fragment-target sequences from the same species of origin (or even try this as a single continuous sequence)? If the sequences are continuous, does adding linker regions between the fragment and target alter the results? Does the order of concatenation affect the results (concatenating from the N or C-termini of the target?). 2) In Figure 2A, the peaks indicating inhibitory activity correlate positively with the observed peaks in calculated weighted N_contacts, which forms the basis for all inferences. However, the data reveals an interesting observation in the initial segment of the protein fragment (0 to 100 aa) that while there is a peak indicating predicted binding by the AlphaFold model, there is no corresponding inhibitory activity observed for the protein in that region. Any comments on this discrepancy? 3) The authors introduce (f_native,pairwise) and (f_native,binding) to quantify similarities between experimentally solved structures and AlphaFold2 models. We found the explanation of these metrics to be confusing, one refers to the fragment and the target site but the other refers to the native binding site bound by the fragment. Is one referring to the contacts made in the experimental structure and the other the contacts in the AlphaFold model? Further clarification of what these precisely correspond to would be helpful for discerning the similarities and differences between the two. 4) In both figures 2 and 3 the authors show structures of the experimentally solved complexes and the predicted AlphaFold models side by side. We were curious to know whether the AlphaFold models were able to recapitulate the sidechain conformations. In addition we were also curious to know whether the AlphaFold model recapitulated any key contacts made between the binding site and the fragment (ex: salt bridges, electrostatic interactions between charged amino acids, pi-pi stacks, hydrogen bonds between sidechains). 5) The authors explain their use of tiling to generate inhibitory fragments and that overlapping fragments generate greater predicted binding peaks. Have the authors attempted to use smaller fragments in their program (i.e. what is the smallest fragment size that AlphaFold can still predict to be correctly binding?). We are curious to know if effects vary by changing the fragment sizes. Further, can this method be expanded upon to study multiple different fragments that bind to different sites on the target protein simultaneously? Minor points: 1) The orange and yellow lines used to show contacts between the fragment and target are difficult to distinguish from each other. Consider a different set of colors? 2) Figure 4C+E. The use of black in the model makes it difficult to distinguish the sidechains and interactions with the fragment. - Reviewed by CJ San Felipe, Priyanka Bajaj and James Fraser (UCSF)",2024-02-21T19:14:22,,Priyanka Bajaj,10.1101/2023.12.19.572389,High-throughput computational discovery of inhibitory protein fragments with AlphaFold,"Andrew Savinov, Sebastian Swanson, Amy E.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.24.577062v1#comment-6395818896,biorxivstage,1,"(The comments below are my own thoughts and aren’t meant to serve as a substitute for peer review) This manuscript presents a much-needed quantitative examination of structures of LeuT fold transporters, which are helical membrane proteins that import and export a wide variety of substrates in and out of cells. In the context of protein dynamics, this superfamily is characterized by a diverse range of conformational changes amongst its members, with some helices staying fixed in some representatives but not others throughout their respective transport cycles. In this analysis, the authors break down these conformational changes between pairs of structures using a rotationally- and translationally-invariant method for tracking helical movements (distance difference matrices, or DDMs). From these movements, the authors conclude that bundle-hash rocking is the foundation defining all conformational changes in proteins in this superfamily. The results are compelling, but my enthusiasm is somewhat dampened by the use of a comparatively small dataset and relative absence of mathematical rigor. I think this can easily be addressed with a bit of additional analysis. The basis for the main finding, stated above, derives from a principal component analysis (PCA) of these DDMs. If my understanding is correct, the authors use distance differences in 22 pairs of structures across nine proteins and arrive at six distinct motions that can explain most of these changes. While the authors show the reconstruction error when different numbers of principal components (PCs) are used in Fig 3D, I did not see a mathematical justification for selecting six components specifically. It might help to compute a statistical criteria such as the Akaike or Bayesian Information Criterion to verify that six PCs is the appropriate number. By the same token, it would be beneficial to run some cross-validation on some intentionally left out structural pairs. A low reconstruction error on proteins left out during parametrization would go some way toward supporting the authors’ conclusion that these movements are shared. For example, can the conformational dynamics of NSSs like SERT and LeuT be explained entirely using PCs derived from structures in other families? Finally, I would strongly encourage the authors to expand their analysis to include new structures deposited after mid-2021. I understand that this would add a lot of work, as I suspect that segmentation and assignment of residues to helices is done manually. But given the rapid clip at which these LeuT-fold structures are being deposited in recent years, it could significantly increase the size of the dataset. Off the top of my head, this would add NKCC1, KimA, and SGLT2, and probably others. Beyond that, a few things here and there stood out: •	It isn’t clear based on Fig 3F or the text if the PCA itself is segmented by specific steps in the conformational cycle, or if the structural pairs are unlabeled during analysis (I suspect the latter from the text). •	On the use of pymol cealign to align pairs of structures, it is a little strange given that this is a sequence-independent method intended to align proteins with little to no sequence homology. However, given the low RMSD between their pairs of structures, and that the paper’s bulk focuses on alignment-independent analysis, this is unlikely to affect the conclusions much at all (I've also tested it on a few pairs and the results look more or less identical to other sequence- and structure-based alignment methods). With that in mind though, I wouldn't state RMSD values in the text if they were calculated this way, unless they are supplemented by other metrics, such as TM-score •	The name MntH is used throughout the text, except at the very end where the name DraNramp is used. I assume these are the same protein? •	I just want to say that including an analysis where the membrane serves as a reference plane for a structural analysis is a great idea and very much appreciated, and I hope others follow your example and do the same thing",2024-02-20T16:27:03,diegodelalamo,Diego del Alamo,10.1101/2024.01.24.577062,They all rock: A systematic comparison of conformational movements in LeuT-fold transporters,"Jacob A.

If they are in the same dish it would quite difficult in dens(ish) cultures as shown to be assured of independence; in your methods you talk about 3-8 independent experiments - here exemplary analysis showing the data as visualised via e.g. SuperPlotsofData by J Goedhard ( https://huygens.science.uva... & DOI: 10.1083/jcb.202001064) would give assurance that these datasets are good to be assembled/pooled together?",2024-02-19T15:17:57,disqus_aJzyAy9SiL,Mathis Riehle,10.1101/2024.02.11.579797,Single molecule imaging of the central dogma reveals myosin-2A gene expression is regulated by contextual translational buffering,"O’Neil Wiggan, Timothy J.

The authors did a great service to the field by highlighting that MES has the potential to compete with gas fermentations! Congratulations! In case my quick comment from earlier gets published, I apologize for the partial double post. However, after reading the paper more carefully, I wanted to amend the post and add the following: 1)	One concern regards the presentation and perception of the data, which could provide an unjust hurdle for others in the field when publishing their MES improvements. While nothing is stated wrongly, the abstract already implies a >200-day production of carboxylic acids at an unprecedented rate, efficiency, and current density. However, the stated maximum values are derived from what seems to be single measurements (CP) or a series of two values (CA) in a time series and represent spikes in productivity. Thus, other studies that might achieve improved average KPIs, e.g., stable production rates between the average rate and the peak rate achieved in this study (which seem to differ by a factor of about two; ~20 kg/m3 vs. ~40 kg/m3 butyrate in Fig. S4A, for example), could be regarded as not improving the field, because the production rates presented in the abstract and highlighted in the main text give the impression that higher rates have been achieved already during long-term operation. This leads me to a quantification question: How confident are the authors regarding the accuracy of the values of individual measurements? The data is significantly scattered, which could be due to a scatter in the sampling and quantification methods or due to biological fluctuations. While it is certainly possible that the microbial system performs exceptionally well for a few days only to subsequently crash and almost halt production for the next few days, a high scatter in the quantification methods (i.e., high measurement or sampling uncertainty) could result in a similar data profile. Unfortunately, the temporal resolution of the data is not high enough to clearly show biological fluctuation (with the potential exception of the 2-4 point peak in Figure 4D). Without clear evidence that the exceptional production rates and increases in product concentration are indeed caused by true biological fluctuations, highlighting these occasional values throughout the manuscript seems misleading. Even if these production rates are the result of biological fluctuations, a more detailed discussion of the highly fluctuating performance and its impact might be warranted. If dense biofilms are prone to cause these enormous fluctuations that would open an exciting and important field of research for biofilm-based MES. Nevertheless, the described system seems unable to continuously produce the exceptional amounts of product frequently highlighted in the manuscript. Therefore, reporting averaged production rates (over at least 3-5 measurements) together with peak values in sections like Abstract, Summaries, Conclusions, and Highlights (which are most likely to be posted most visibly and therefore picked up by data mining and AI nowadays used to gather data) would be a more honest representation of the results and seems more appropriate to me. The rates and other performance indicators are extraordinary enough, even without the focus on a few exceptional values. 2)	Furthermore, a comparison to “state of the art” MES systems and the statement that “biofilm-based MES have so far outperformed MES driven by microorganisms in suspension by several orders of magnitude” should be backed by values cited from the appropriate sources. The rates and other KPIs for studies cited in the paragraph starting line 59 are not mentioned to allow verification of the order of magnitude statement. Further, I would like to add that we recently also achieved integrated electrosynthesis of acetate with suspended cells at 40-95% CE and at rates that approach glucose-fed chemostats at high acetate titers, which is in the order of the “state of the art” KPIs cited later in the paper ( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.b... and supplements). A direct comparison to a variety of studies in multiple KPIs instead of hand-picking pair-wise comparisons would help to paint a more holistic picture of the improvements this study adds to the field. 3)	The microbial biomass reported is very high. Even to a degree that almost sounds impossible. Do the authors report wet weight or dry weight? I assumed dry weight because the cited reference states “Consequently, assuming νN,X = 0.2 molN molX−1 as coefficient of nitrogen in the elemental formula of dry biomass, (Popovic, 2019) the total amount of biomass in the reactor was obtained… “. 390 g/L dry weight would exceed the dry mass density of the cytoplasm of E. coli ( https://doi.org/10.1371/jou.... Further, water content is essential within biofilms and has been determined for several pure cultures and mixed biofilms and usually ranges from 70-98% (e.g., https://doi.org/10.1080/104..., whereas the maximum water content at 390 g/L cell mass would be less than 65% and exclude larger flow channels. Further, the cathode volume presumably also includes the carbon felt (assumed density 0.1g/cm3 with a carbon density of 2g/cm3 = ~5% of the cathode volume). Thus, less than 60% of the cathode compartment volume would be water. To push 2 cm/s of fluid through such a dense biofilm seems almost impossible to me! Could you provide a little more detail into how this incredible biomass density was calculated and whether this density is comparable to other biofilm systems? Further, do you assume EPS is in the biofilm, and would this contain N as well? Could ammonia pass the Cation Exchange membrane and be lost? Could ammonia (or other volatile N-compounds) be stripped in the bubble column and impact the biomass quantification in a long-term experiment? 4)	Why focus the comparison to other non-MES systems on syngas fermentation? H2/CO2 gas fermentation would be more similar to the MES process. For Example, Kantzow and colleagues produced 148g/L/d acetate or (>2.4 gc L-1 h-1) from H2/CO2 in a continuous system with suspended cells (10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.07.020). Further, Figure 5 B is likely not the best visualization of the comparison to other studies, because the points of all comparison studies cannot be distinguished on the [X] axis. The SI table containing the values would be more informative than this figure in the main MS. I’m happy to discuss more and again congrats to a MES system that performs so well! P.S. Based on your experience with this system, do you think Clostridium luticellarii and Eubacterium limosum would be good candidates for pure culture MES?",2024-02-16T19:24:51,joergdeutzmann,Joerg Deutzmann,10.1101/2024.02.08.579422,Microbial Electrosynthesis from CO2 reaches Productivity of Syngas and Chain Elongation Fermentations,"Oriol Cabau-Peinado, Marijn Winkelhorst, Rozanne Stroek, Roderick de Kat Angelino, Adrie J.J.

You're right that we basically infer this and don't have direct evidence in the case of TOPORS, which is why in the manuscript we're careful to only say that TOPORS promotes the polyUb. SUMOylation and the proteasome have both been shown to be necessary for DNMT1-DPC degradation previously (see nice work from Niels Mailand's and Julian Stingele's labs), but loss of RNF4 - the STUbL described up until now - did not prevent all of the degradation. The additional effect of further depleting TOPORS on degradation, coupled with the proteasome-dependence of the degradation, is what makes us infer that TOPORS' Ub ligase activity is at work here. I will say we're currently addressing reviewers' comments and will hopefully be able to shed more light on this. It's looking promising experimentally on several fronts, but in our hands the DNMT1-DPC polyubiquitylation is tricky to see nicely, which we think suggests that it's degraded quite quickly by the proteasome.

It may turn out to be useful for studying Proteus syndrome. Unfortunately, the preprint by He et al includes a number of errors and misconceptions about Proteus syndrome, previously published results, and general concepts about therapeutic research. It is odd that they expected to find the Proteus syndrome variant in a lymphoblast cell line (Coriell GM12209) as it has been shown that no living patient with Proteus syndrome has the variant detectable in a peripheral blood sample (PMID 21793738). In that publication, only two of 38 blood samples were positive and both of those were from deceased patients and could not be replicated. As stated in GeneReviews “It is strongly recommended to not use peripheral blood for molecular genetic testing in individuals with suspected PS.” The authors refer to our work (PMID 31194862) when they state: “Chimera animal models9 with germline transmission of the conditional AKT1 allele recapitulate the clinical manifestations of PS syndrome in the skin, bones, and vasculature…” It makes no sense to refer to chimeras and germline transmission. As well, these animals did not have an abnormal skeletal phenotype, nor did they have significant skin manifestations. The statement “Animal models are also unsuitable for identifying patient-specific treatment responses due to variations across species.” is perplexing. Animal models are widely used to model therapeutic effects. It is unclear what is meant by “patient-specific”. They claim their model is “consistent with the vascular malformation systematically seen in Proteus syndrome patients”. Indeed, there are no manifestations of the disorder seen “systematically”. The disorder is mosaic and thus not all patients have any particular manifestation. It makes no sense to refer to a “50% mosaic mutation”. The correct term to use here would be ‘variant allele fraction’. In a constitutional heterozygous genotype, VAF is 50%. If 50% of cells harbor a heterozygous variant, the VAF is 25%. It is nonsensical to say that a given mutation level is “mirroring clinical observations”. Since every patient has a different level of VAF and that level varies across tissues, it is not clear that this claim has any meaning. It is not correct that miransertib “…has shown efficacy in reducing facial bone overgrowth and the size of cerebriform connective tissue nevi in PS patients after one year of treatment, although a survey of 41 patients indicated no significant improvement in overall clinical outcomes as per the Clinical Gestalt Assessment (CGA) for PS10” (10 is the citation for PMID 35461279). In fact, that publication included no data on treatment. The authors seem to have misinterpreted our publication on vascular abnormalities in mouse models of Proteus syndrome (PMID 33030203). While the AKT1 activating variant caused an abnormal honeycomb-shaped capillary network with increased density of endothelial tubes, the key conclusion of that paper is that this variant caused a defect in the vascular remodeling of the capillary network, preventing the formation of the higher ordered vascular branching network. The He et al paper should discuss a technical limitation of their vascular organoid method in analyzing vascular remodeling in vitro. It is surprising that the methods section of the publication does not include any information on the sourcing of the therapeutics used in the study. It is important to include this in the methods as there are numerous sources of therapeutic compounds that are of dubious quality.",2024-02-09T13:32:31,christopherours,Christopher Ours,10.1101/2024.01.26.577324,Human vascular organoids with a mosaic AKT1 mutation recapitulate Proteus syndrome,"Siyu He, Yuefei Zhu, Shradha Chauhan, Daniel Naveed Tavakol, Jong Ha Lee, Rayna Batya-Leia Berris, Cong Xu, Jounghyun H.

Specifically, the multiplication of gross production value by percentage losses will not represent the total economic costs. To obtain these monetary impacts you need to subtract the observed value from the counterfactual production value. In practice the influence of this error is small in the study context, where the percentage cumulative losses are small (~5%). But any work building on this could correct it for more precise estimates. Fixing it will become important when trying to estimate economic impacts of individual events, where the percentage losses can be considerable.

Under conditions where the [I]/[E] ratio is less than 10, the binding of substrate to enzyme leads to substrate depletion, resulting in the apparent emergence of an uncompetitive inhibition component. Consequently, it is reasonable to suggest that the inhibition of 3CLpro by Ensitrelvir is just competitive, and the apparent binding to the ES complex is likely an artifact. Despite these findings, the applied analytical methods in the paper show promise.

The involvement of K+ counter transport in SERT has been known since the beginning of the 1980'ies, but its actual binding site has remained elusive. The binding sites for Na+ and Cl- have been solved by cryo-EM and since K+ binding seems to be competitive to Na+, it is logical to look for K+ in either of the two Na+ sites. I must post two comments for this paper. 1. In the endeavor of elucidating the functional role of K+, we found that it also plays a role in the transport of dopamine by the dopamine transporter (Schmidt et al. 2022 Nat Commun). The authors comment on this finding by stating that we did find an interaction with K+, but ""it has been more difficult to demonstrate that the K+ efflux is coupled directly to dopamine uptake "". In the paper we show that it binds; we show that it increases the transport rate and concentrative capacity of dopamine. This is like what is shown in this paper. We also show that the rate of K+ efflux is increased in the presence of dopamine. Collectively, I find that quite strong. Just as strong as the data herein. So did the reviewers. 2.  I do not understand the bell-shaped curve for the APP+ uptake into proteoliposomes. Why does the fluorescence decrease? Is is photobleaching? As APP+ is being transported, the gradients start to dissipate. SERT will eventually go in an exchange mode expelling as much APP+ as is transported. The transport is saturated if you wish. It should not decrease unless external APP+ has been removed.

The listed comments are the result of that discussion] Summary It has been implicitly assumed that all mosquitoes, carrying Plasmodium sporozoites (SPZs) in their salivary glands (SGs), are infectious to their mammalian hosts. One recent study (Aleshnick et al. 2020) challenged this assumption by showing that the probability of mouse infection per a single mosquito bite increases with the number of SPZs the mosquito carries in the SGs. Here, authors extend this previous work to investigate how the number of SPZs in the salivary glands relates to the number of oocysts in the mosquito's gut and to the number of SPZs that mosquitoes expelled during probing on artificial skin. The authors went through many experimental steps to rigorously quantify the SPZ number (in mosquito and expelled) and the number of intact and ruptured oocysts. Authors also used two different ways to generate SPZs in mosquitoes - by feeding the mosquitoes blood culture of gametocytes and by feeding mosquitoes on blood from Plasmodium-infected individuals. While previous work focused on murine Plasmodium species, this study looked at human parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) that is likely to be more relevant to human malaria. The results are in line with several previous findings: the number of SG SPZs correlates with the number of oocysts and with the number of SPZs expelled into the skin, and mosquitoes with more oocysts have SPZs in SG earlier. Positive feedback There are many things to like about this paper. Although the question is not new, the authors approached it with high rigor of experimental design and performed many troubleshooting analyses (many of the latter are shown in Supplement, e.g., Fig 8). The experimental procedures are well described and problems associated with the data are mentioned. The analyses performed are mostly straightforward. A combination of different techniques (dissection, microscopy, PCR) provides a more comprehensive understanding of system. Studying human malaria parasites is important, and measurements done for mosquitoes fed on cultured gametocytes and on blood from P. Falciparum-infected volunteers are very interesting. Major comments 1. The authors performed some basic statistical analyses but, in some cases, the choices of the models used were not clearly justified. For example, for looking at relationships between oocyst density and infection, authors used logistic regression. In correlation analyses, spearman rank correlation was used. Why were those the right choices? Using linear regression (Pearson correlation) could be more sensitive to trends, Deming regression is more appropriate when there is an error in both variables, and using alternative models to look at relationships between oocyst density and SG SPZ number, or SPZ number and expelled SPZs could reveal useful information (e.g., for different alternative models see PMID:  32453765). 2. Additional points regarding statistical rigor/analyses. What is exactly oocyst density and infection prevalence (Fig 1B)? How can oocyst density be <1? Is that an average per several mosquitoes? This is not well explained. At 100 oocyst density there are still not 100% infections - how is that possible? Is that because time of sampling is too early and SPZs did not yet develop? Perhaps structuring the data on time since feeding could reveal interesting patterns. Also, analysis of binned data (e.g., Fig 2A and others) is not a good way to analyze data because answer may depend on binning choices (e.g.,  17960243). Finally, presenting results when excluding mosquitoes that did not deposit SPZ as main result is incorrect as this likely introduces bias. 3. Generating calibration curve and determining threshold for estimating the number of SPZs in the sample is important. How did you generate the dilutions of the SPZ numbers and how did you make sure that you had 100k vs. 5 in other samples? Did you count the 5 SPZs or was that estimated? If estimated, did you take into account errors with the dilution? I wonder if plotting the data using a log-log plot and doing a linear regression analysis would be useful for Fig 1A. Also, for Suppl Fig 2A, how many samples are the curves based on? Should that be plotted for every sample analyzed? 4. While I appreciate the generate a robust artificial skin model, I wonder how realistic is using artificial skin with blood. In real skin, mosquitoes must probe to find the blood vessel while with the artificial skin, mosquito may find blood every time of probing - could that bias the results in some ways? 5. Previous work established the importance of probing time and unimportance of taking the blood meal for infection (32453765). What were these parameters in your experiments and could they explain difference in how SPZ numbers in SG relate to number of expelled parasites? 6. The finding that there is not ""threshold"" in the number of expelled parasites with SG SPZ number is interesting. What if you assume that infection occurs only if the number of deposited SPZs is above some critical number - will then you able to ""match"" the threshold model found previously (32453765)? 7. One interesting mosquito had 9 ruptured oocysts but only about 2k SPZs - how is this possible? Where are the other SPZs? Could it be that they are in the “missing” parts of the salivary glands? That seems unlikely. 8. The authors have very rich dataset but did not make conclusions that could be also interesting. For example, how many SPZs are made per oocyst given these data? What is the summary of maturation process from these data? Having a cartoon with steps and quantifying them (e.g., what is the efficacy of transfer of SPZs from gut to SG?) could be very useful (e.g., as Figure 6 or as graphical abstract). 9. In their sporozoite quantification assay, the authors used the COX1 mitochondrial gene target. This gene is typically present in multiple copies in eukariots. However, it is not mentioned anywhere in the manuscript how many copies of the gene are present in the P. falciparum mitochondria. It is also not mentioned nor tested if all the different populations of P. falciparum used in this study have the exact same COX1 copy number. If they share the same copy number, then the sporozoite quantification assay presented is indeed robust. However, if this number of copies varies between P. falciparum populations, and moreover, within a population, then the quantification assay will lack robustness. In such cases, it would have been more valuable to use a single-copy nuclear gene. Could the authors provide more information regarding the COX1 copy number in P. falciparum and check that this number of copies is consistent across all populations? 10. When looking at the Methods section, I realized that the authors have used two different populations of P. falciparum to infect their An. stephensi: NF54 from West Africa and NF135 from Cambodia. When measuring the duration of the EIP, the authors stated that '…mosquitoes were fed with P. falciparum NF54 and NF135 gametocytes…'. Did the authors infect their An. stephensi mosquitoes with a mix of these NF54 and NF135 gametocytes, or did they infect each batch of mosquitoes with one parasite population (i.e. either NF54 or NF135)? If they infected each batch of mosquitoes with one parasite population, why is this not reflected in the text and on the figures? Did one population produce more oocysts and sporozoites than the other? If the authors mixed NF54 and NF135, what is the rationale for doing this? I suspect these two populations also vary in their ability to produce gametocytes. Did the authors observe recombination between the two populations? Also do An. stephensi mosquitoes exhibit the same host-parasite compatibility/co-adaptation with both populations of parasites? If not, this could be a possible explanation for the weak correlation found between the total sporozoite load and the sporozoite expelled. I suggest that the authors carefully clarify these points, as it is quite confusing at the moment in the present manuscript. Minor comments 1. Because of very large difference in SPZ numbers, plotting the data on log (or log-log) scale would help to see the data scatter better. Also, perhaps in some cases highlighting  ranges of oocysts and/or SPZ number in SG that are ""realistic for the field"" (e.g., by using gray boxes) could be useful. 2. The authors could calculate the total number of SPZs in the mosquito and the skin which is better than that done in previous study that calculated residual SPZ number in SGs (32453765). However, would any conclusions that look at correlating SG SPZ number with other parameters change if you consider the remaining SPZ number rather than total per mosquito (e.g., Fig 2A, 3A/C, 4B, etc)? 3. In Fig. 1D: What is the rationale for comparing mercurochrome staining of oocysts at day 8 with anti-CSP immunostaining at day 18? Why not compare both stainings at both time points (i.e., mercurochrome at day 8 and immunostaining at day 8, as well as mercurochrome at day 18 and immunostaining at day 18)? Otherwise, it's challenging to compare different staining methods at different time points and draw robust conclusions about the number of oocysts present. 4. In their discussion, the authors never mentioned that potential co-evolution between hosts and parasites could explain why they observed a tighter correlation between total sporozoite load and sporozoites expelled in the context of the infection conducted in Burkina Faso. Indeed, for this experiment, naturally circulating P. falciparum parasites were used to infect their sympatric host, An. coluzzii. However, this is not the case for the lab experiment, where two geographically and genetically distant parasites (i.e., NF54 from West Africa and NF135 from Cambodia) were used to infect An. stephensi, Nijmengen Sind-Kasur strain, which originates from Pakistan and has therefore not coevolved with either of these parasite strains. 5. In Fig. 2B: When examining the EIP, authors chose to assess the number of sporozoites per mosquito at days 9, 10, and 11 post-feeding with gametocytes. They also looked at the number of sporozoites in a single oocyst and compared these numbers at days 9 and 10. Why not also investigate day 11, as they did for the EIP? Do the authors know the dynamics of sporozoite growth in an oocyst? Does it exponentially increase until the oocysts burst? Does it reach a plateau at some point and then burst? It would be very interesting to explore these aspects. 6. I did not see that the data are made available.

Strengths: (1) As opposed to opioids, SSRIs and NSAIDs, the usage of targeted senolytics to clear senescent osteoclasts addresses chronic pain at the cellular level. This provides a new modality among the available treatment regimens. (2) This is one of those articles where we see the promise of molecular medicine. The RNA primer selection was highly relevant and specific for neuronal development, differentiation and metabolism. These served to accurately assess the relationship of spinal hypersensitivity and the mechanism of action of senolytics. Additionally, this research helped to further tease apart the signaling pathways associated with senescence and senolytics. Weaknesses: (1) With regards to the sham group, there is a possibility that detachment of the posterior paravertebral muscles from L3-L5 possibly induced a level of mechanical instability. To mimic the stress of surgery in the sham group, saline injections into the paravertebral muscles could mimic the muscular disruption of surgery without inducing spinal instability. (2) Inclusion of a non-surgical ""sham"" group, female mice, and surgically altered, aged mice, in the control set would be helpful in identifying the mechanism of drug action. (3) Although mice are not bipedal, it may be helpful in preparation for the use in humans to evaluate the L5 and S1 endplates as well since the L5/S1 endplates are more likely to be degenerative in adults than L4/5. (4) It was difficult to assess the behavioral effects since there was no baseline prior to surgery, after surgery and before the administration of navitoclax. (5) Additionally, in studies moving forward, the risks and benefits of the systemic side effects of navitoclax should be evaluated.",2024-01-26T22:14:47,juliatrevorrow,Julia  Trevorrow,10.1101/2023.10.26.564218,Senescence of endplate osteoclasts induces sensory innervation and spinal pain,"Dayu Pan, Kheiria Gamal Benkato, Xuequan Han, Jinjian Zheng, Vijay Kumar, Mei Wan, Junying Zheng, Xu Cao",2023-10-26

As of 24. January 2024 the revised version is online, which addresses many of the earlier reviewer comments. Nevertheless, there are always points and questions that are still open and as the authors of this manuscript we would very much like to hear your opinions.

The color glass filter used is not specified, and its performance is only characterized within a small range of wavelengths, which limits the fluorophores that can be used and the total number that could be used in this system, unlike some of the previous methods. It can of course be a strength that fluorophores in a small spectral range can be used for 2(to-4?)-plex imaging instead of having to use well-separated fluorophores which have wildly different photophysics, so that potential limitation is not in any way fatal. The paper would benefit from more discussion of how the present work fits into the current landscape, both positives and negatives.",2024-01-23T15:37:22,nick_bauer,Nick Bauer,10.1101/2024.01.17.576082,Spectrally Resolved Localization Microscopy with Ultrahigh-Throughput,"James Ethan Batey, Geun Wan Kim, Meek Yang, Darby Claire Heffer, Elric Dion Pott, Hannah Giang, Bin Dong",2024-01-20
