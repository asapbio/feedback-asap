(2024) identified a physical interaction between ERC1 and ATG8e, leading them to explore potential ATG8-interaction motifs (AIMs) in ERC1. Using the iLIR database (Jacomin et al., 2016) for AIM prediction, they found the results irrelevant to the ERC1-ATG8e interaction, indicating a false prediction. Through truncated ERC1 variants, they identified a non-canonical AIM undetectable by current prediction tools, which focus on the canonical [W/F/Y]-[X]-[X]-[L/I/V] sequence. They validated this motif with AlphaFold2-multimer (AFM), a method we previously demonstrated (Ibrahim et al., 2023) to accurately predict non-canonical AIMs, as shown with ATG3.

Obviously there are informative samples in the world that weren't sequenced and there is sequencing data that hasn't been published. An identity vs sampling date plot would be limited to samples that were later published and would be out of date in a couple months. More importantly, I don't see any value in the impossible counterfactual of what we would know if sequences that were eventually published had instead been instantaneously sequenced and published on their sampling date. Of course, the answer is: ""we would know what we knew eventually, but earlier."" But that's also the answer if sampling followed by sequencing and publication was more frequent regardless of the rates of the different steps. Figure 2 in this paper clearly shows the value of adding data, especially before the spotlight shines on a virus like it did in 2020 and triggers sequencing of retrospective samples. This is important, because several of the data points in Figure 2 correspond to samples that have had the scientists who collected and sequenced samples and published the sequences targeted with conspiracy theories. This disincentivizes rapid publication of data. For example, the mid-2021 data point for RaTG15 prompted a letter to one of the authors of the corresponding publication with a weirdly inaccurate argument that an early-2020 data point for RaTG13 is inauthentic. The letter says ""it has not been possible to assemble the RaTG13 genome sequence"" while linking to a Virological.org post in which everyone who tries succeeds at assembling the RaTG13 genome sequence.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.19.604369v1#comment-6542077297,biorxivstage,1,"Summary The study investigates the human protein DJ-1, which is known for its role in detoxifying the metabolic bioproduct methylglyoxal (MG). There has been an ongoing debate over whether DJ-1 acts directly on MG (direct substrate) or requires a protein intermediate acting as a protein/nucleic acid deglycase (glycated protein substrate). The authors used fixed-target micro-crystallography and mix-and-inject serial crystallography to structurally analyze covalent intermediates in the reaction catalyzed by DJ-1. One of the significant achievements of the study is the successful use of these advanced crystallography methods to determine the structure of key reaction intermediates: hemithioacetal and L-lactoylcysteine, providing new insights into DJ-1's glyoxalase mechanism. However, a major weakness is that the authors' claim refuting the alternative deglycase mechanism are not fully supported by the presented data. Despite this limitation, the study advances our understanding of DJ-1’s enzymatic function by leveraging MISC at synchrotron using the new flow cell injector. Major points Major point 1 The claim made in the discussion that: “These results provide direct structural evidence supporting a growing number of enzymology studies also indicating that DJ-1 is not a deglycase…” is not supported by evidence presented in the manuscript. Although this work elegantly demonstrates that MG covalently modifies the catalytic cysteine of DJ-1 (Cys106), the crystallography experiments presented are unable to test whether the alternative mechanism (with a glycated substrate) occurs. More careful treatment of this logic in the discussion would strengthen the manuscript, and would help the manuscript to be more focused on the compelling X-ray crystallography results. We recognize it is difficult to “prove a negative” however these experiments affirm the primary activity without directly testing the alternative one. Major point 2 The authors report compelling evidence that the DJ-1 catalytic cysteine (Cys106) is covalently modified by MG. However, the concentration of MG used was 50 mM, and non-catalytic cysteines might be covalently modified at this concentration. Indeed, it’s possible that one of the DJ-1 surface cysteines is covalently modified (Cys53), based on the large positive difference peak in the FO-FO difference density (Figure 5b, Figure S8) (although it is suggested that this is evidence of allosteric communication). Covalent modification of a surface cysteine leading to lattice disruption is consistent with the observation that MG is known to dissolve DJ-1 crystals. The manuscript could be strengthened by consideration of these points, as well as analysis of difference maps around Cys53 for the fixed target structure (e.g. add panel to Figure S1 showing FO(methylglyoxal)-FO(free) maps around Cys53). Discussion of the differences in modification rates for the catalytic and surface cysteines, and the impact of large versus small crystals, would be helpful. Major point 3 Is it plausible that a second, synchronized turnover is captured by the mix-and-inject experiment? This claim might be developed by modeling the concentration profile of the intermediates along the 30 second time course (e.g. similar to Figure 4 in PMID 29848358). To this point, were the occupancies of the covalent adducts refined at each time point? Did the authors consider whether a mixture of species might be present? The evidence supporting the second turnover comes from the featureless difference map calculated between the 3 sec and 20 sec time points (FO(20s)-FO(3s) in Figure S6). Is there an alternative explanation for the decreased occupancy at this time point other than synchronized turnover? E.g. a problem with sample mixing resulting in lower substrate concentration at this time point. A related concern is whether the data as presented can discriminate between the two covalent intermediates (HTA or LC). Perhaps Figure S7 would be strengthened by adding the FO-FC difference maps for each of the intermediates modeled with the other species (e.g. the HTA dataset modeled with LC and vice versa). Can the authors comment on the lack of correlated negative (or positive) density in the FO-FO difference map matrix (Figure S5) in panels comparing sp2 and sp3 carbons (e.g. FO(15s)-FO(3s)). In this example, there is a large positive peak in the difference map for the sp2 to sp3 change, but no correlated negative peak. Minor points Minor point 1 Was the covalent adduct observed in the MG-soaked DJ-1 crystals presented in Figure S1c modeled? Is the difference density consistent with the HTA or LC intermediates? Or a mixture of both? Minor point 2 Is it possible that movement of the active site histidine (His126) away from covalent intermediate (Figure 4a) is consistent with histidine protonation? Or is the geometry such that protonation is unlikely? Minor point 3 We find it helpful if the figure (or figure legend) includes PDB codes for their quick look up. Minor point 4 The size of the scale bar in Figure S1a might be increased. Review by: Pooja Asthana, Galen J. Correy & James S. Fraser (UCSF)",2024-09-03T22:48:26,poojaasthana,Pooja Asthana,,,,

In the Result subchapter titled “Gentle antibody stripping is necessary for sequential immunostaining with scores of iterations” at line 171 and following you mention several potential Ab stripping reagents, which are not further detailed in the M&M section. Furthermore, you mention beta-ME (line 173) and a low Ph buffer (line 175) as two separate stripping solutions. In the text, there is only one proprietary buffer, IRISKit® HyperView Advanced Ab Stripping Kit , for which a webpage in chinese can be found ( http://m.luminiris.cn/pd.jsp?pid=14) and no information on the composition can be obtained, neither you provide in the manuscript. To my knowledge, there is no mention in the scientific peer-reviewed literature of beta-ME ALONE as a stripping buffer. Besides the inventor of the 2-ME containing buffer, Laemmli (Nature. 1970;227:680–685), the earliest mention of beta-ME for stripping is Pirici (doi: 10.1369/jhc.2009.953240), after which we did quite some experiments (doi: 10.1369/0022155414536732; doi: 10.1097/pai.0000000000000203; doi: 10.1369/0022155417719419, this latter viewed 23,855 times and quoted in 101 papers).

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.06.579243v1#comment-6532603542,biorxivstage,0,"The study titled “Temporal dynamics of BMP/Nodal ratio drive tissue-specific gastrulation morphogenesis” investigates how Nodal signaling dynamics and its interactions with BMP signaling affect convergence and extension (C&E) in zebrafish. Emig et.al. employs a combination of methods, including a novel tool for manipulating Nodal activation timing with optogenetics, gene expression profiles, and tissue-specific transplants in embryos. This work shows a critical role for the temporal ratio of BMP to Nodal signaling in establishing tissue-specific C&E. High Nodal signaling at only before 4-hours post fertilization promotes mesoderm-driven extension, while a high BMP/Nodal ratio during this time window promotes extension driven by the neural ectoderm. The study efficiently utilizes explants to dissect these signaling pathways, and then supports the findings by demonstrating similar effects in intact embryos. However, the work would be strengthened by a better characterization of the BMP/Nodal ratio and downstream targets in their experimental manipulations. The study elucidates how different methods and timings of Nodal signaling activation induce distinct modes of tissue-specific C&E in zebrafish. The interplay between Nodal and BMP signaling, particularly the timing and ratio of these signals, is crucial in determining whether mesoderm or NE-driven morphogenesis occurs. These findings enhance our understanding of early developmental processes. The paper presents compelling evidence on the distinct C&E programs within the mesoderm and ectoderm regulated by BMP/Nodal signaling ratios during a key developmental window. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the interplay between Nodal and BMP signaling in shaping early embryonic development. Strengths: Clear and Robust Experimental Design: The use of transgenic embryos, mRNA injection, and gene expression analysis provides a strong foundation for the research. The morphological observations coupled with gene expression analysis strengthens the conclusions. The uninjected controls and different concentrations of mRNA were critical in showing the threshold of Nodal signaling. Live imaging provides valuable, real-time data on the cell-autonomous effects of BMP on the ectoderm. Time-Sensitive and Tissue-Specific Manipulation: The use of validated optogenetic tools allowed precise control of Nodal signaling onset. The optogenetic BMP tool allowed for precise control over the timing and location of BMP activity. This revealed a critical window for its influence and highlights the concept of BMP/Nodal ratio as a key factor. Furthermore, the tissue-specific activation of BMP in either mesoderm or ectoderm reinforced the link between BMP signaling and distinct tissue behaviors. Points of consideration: Measuring the BMP/Nodal Ratio: The BMP/Nodal ratio was measured over time using transcriptional profiling in the original explant models. The manipulations that the authors perform in the rest of the paper are meant to alter the BMP/Nodal dynamics throughout this time course. However, it is unclear to the reviewers if the BMP/Nodal ratio was measured in these manipulations. It would be nice to detail the dynamics of this ratio with data rather than the schematics in each figure. The authors could do this with transcriptional profiling or staining for SMAD activity as shown in Figure 2. In addition, staining for SMAD activity would perhaps be more indicative of actual signaling ratios rather than the transcriptional products, which might have multiple inputs.",2024-08-21T16:52:34,disqus_NPSIw5eJXD,DUPA- Preprint Review,,,,

The study reveals the molecular basis for receptor sequestration, including information that can be exploited to develop actionable patterns for developing chemokine-based CCR5 targeting molecules that promote retention of the receptor inside the cell. This is particularly noteworthy because CCR5 plays a crucial role in the immune system and is important in numerous physiological and pathological processes such as inflammation, cancer, and HIV transmission. The work has great scope and importance as an alternative therapeutics strategy to address inflammation, cancer, and HIV transmission, and the experiments are well-designed and sound. The manuscript is well-written, clear, and has a reasonable and logical flow. We have some minor comments and a few methodological suggestions that would improve the quality of the manuscript. 1.	The authors have used the widely accepted APEX proximity labeling technique; however, they have not included a mock or vehicle-treated control to accurately examine the interacting proteins in the different ligand stimulated conditions. This would compensate for any proteins that interact with CCR5 in the absence of a ligand. 2.	The method section sometimes lacks critical information (please read all and add relevant details when needed, which is important for the nonexperts). For example, Fig 1 has missing details on the negative control or vehicle control to compare time-resolved ligand-dependent trafficking along with some agonists, partial agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists. 3.	The effect of the different ligands on CCR5 functionality and trafficking should be assessed in the physiologically relevant cell line to determine whether the findings from this paper hold true and can be used for therapeutics. Often, using overexpression systems leads to the observation of phenomena that are absent when the receptor is expressed at native levels. 4.	The degradation assays to show CCR5 localization to the lysosome are interesting and relevant but it would be useful to see the whole blot so that the reader can view these as low molecular weight products. 5.	Suppose authors can add time-resolved live confocal microscopy for the trafficking of CCR5 under different treatment conditions and show the colocalization. This would add to the impact of the study.",2024-08-21T16:31:36,disqus_NPSIw5eJXD,DUPA- Preprint Review,,,,

To clarify, we consider these errors on the level of experimental design based off of our experience and researchers’ specific applications and aims. We only label these as errors once we have confirmed that the design choices will not result in viable yields and/or provide reliable experimental results. Regarding the choice of AAV promoter, you’re correct that CMV is a good choice in many cases, however for ubiquitous expression in vivo, we have found widespread silencing in many cells specifically linked to the use of this reporter. Thus when researchers tell us they intend to use their AAV for ubiquitous in vivo expression, we consider this an error and recommend users to select a CAG promoter instead. With respect to toxic genes, additional design considerations may be needed in order to achieve acceptable yields. We label these as errors if we continue to observe persistent and high rates of mutation or low yield of plasmid or virus even after making all possible changes to experimental conditions, including switching E. coli hosts or growing under less stringent conditions, e.g. lower temperature and/or less antibiotics. Thus, these vectors require modification to the sequence itself in order to reach a viable yield. Finally, you made interesting points about CRISPR gRNA vector design. While there are some cases where there is less stringency, we have found the safest approach is to avoid designing a gRNA containing a PAM sequence. However, it is valuable to note these exceptions. Thank you again for your comments. We are thrilled to engage in stimulating conversations about best approaches to vector design in a variety of applications. This paper highlights the need to have these discussions in order to establish best practices across the field.

I must however venture in a technical comment, as I believe the statistical approach you have chosen is weak and prevents you from truly leveraging all the precious information you have generated with the sequencing experiments. Using correlation to find associations between microbial abundance and environmental (or sample) characteristics using data derived from sequencing experiment is generally advised against, as the data is compositional, which means the values are set in a simplex, not a euclidean space. This means that the observed relative abundance values are not independent of each other, as there is an inherent correlation between all taxa: if any microbe increases its true abundance, the relative abundance of everyone else will decrease even if they did not change in true abundance. To find bacterial genera associated with plant traits (or any other characteristic), you should use statistical methods developed specifically for handling microbial relative abundance data. You can look up ANCOM-BC, corncob, DESeq, Aldex, and many others that have been developed to work specifically with sequencing data. Some of these even estimate the changes in absolute abundances. There are other reasons to use these methods too, that have to do with special characteristics of sequencing data (which can hardly be ignored), such as sparseness, overdispersion, to name a few. I recommend the following reads: https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/doi/10.1093/gigascience/giz107/5572529 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010467 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-020-00160-w Moreover, I do not see any mention of multiple testing correction. As you test multiple genera, it is absolutely essential to correct your p-values for multiple testing, otherwise it is almost certain that some of the genera you identified as significantly correlated were only by pure chance, not for biological reasons. Most differential abundance tests mentioned above do this by default, as it is expected for credible results whenever conducting multiple statistical tests. More on this if you are not familiar with this correction: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6099145/ I hope this helps, and good luck with your publication!",2024-08-19T13:52:54,jonathanrondeauleclaire,Jonathan Rondeau-Leclaire,,,,

That the same mutations also abolish GCN2's responsiveness to RAF inhibitors in vitro is less helpful - a dead donkey does not respond to the buggy whip, whether applies its back or to its head. In this vein, interpreting the inability of RAF inhibitors to activate GCN2 when the gatekeeper residue Met802 is mutated (Figure 9) is key to the conclusion that these agents exert their effect on GCN2 by engaging its kinase active site ATP binding pocket. I may have missed it, but is there evidence that the Met802 mutations retain reasonable kinase activity? The Met802Phe is not so helpful in this regard as it may lack 'headroom' for further activation. It might be helpful to measure ISR activation in GCN2∆ cells, reconstituted with GCN2 Met802 mutants in response to histidinol. Preservation of a response to histidinol in face of loss of responsiveness to RAF inhibitors would lend strong support to the authors conclusion.",2024-08-18T14:42:36,,David Ron,,,,

Sorry for delayed response because I did not receive alerts from Biorxiv. In this manuscript, we provided extensive Western blot and IF data to show that phosphorylated RPB1 is not dephosphorylated but rather degraded at protein level during natural NSN-to-SN transition. We agree that transcriptional inhibitor with THZ1 and DRB1 can mimic the action of RPB1 degradation in the sense that they could also dissociate RPB1 from chromatin but without inducing degradation, and hence inducing transition. This action is likely independent of transcription inhibition because blocking transcription inhibition with adenosine analogs without inducing RPB1 dissociation is insufficient to induce transition.
