I noted that you use a delayed saccade task such that the probe was presented either 450 to 950 ms before the saccade (with an average saccade latency of 150 ms). Using a design adapted to human non invasive behavioral measures we found (Szinte et al, eLife, 2018) two spotlights of increased performance with a similar timing (that might correspond to the CF and FF positions and the forward hypothesis) but no real FF when the probe was presented in the latest instant preceding the saccade execution (effect that might correspond to the convergence hypothesis). We speculated that remapping mechanism are orchestrated by spatial attention (Colby et al 1998) and thus takes time to develop. In this interpretation, convergent remapping reflect the response to the saccade target which is presented earlier in time. Did you analyzed your nice multi-layer results as a function of the probe onset relative to the saccade onset ? I would predict a less clear forward remapping for the shortest durations (consistent with Zirnsak et al study who had very short durations).

COMMENT 1 Firstly, I would like to congratulate the authors on their study. I really love the inventiveness of the experimental set up! The results are really unexpected. The finding that phosphate starvation proceeds ABA mediated drought responses is interesting on a mechanistic basis and will likely have direct implications for crop management practices. The field-to-lab experimental pipeline looks really effective and I look forward to more people taking up this approach. RESPONSE 1 Firstly, we would like to apologize for the very late reply. Thank you so much for your interest in our research and your positive evaluation. Our data presented here showed that PSR response occurs earlier than ABA response under mild drought. We used to study drought stress in artificially controlled environments, but we have always been interested in what happens in the actual field, at the molecular level. We had heard a lot about the lab-to-field concept, but we would like to take our research from the field to the lab. The first and corresponding authors have actually interviewed farmers about drought conditions around the world, collaborated with drought researchers around the world, and traveled to drought research sites to see the realities. In listening to such voices in the field, we have been warming up our thoughts about what we should do as plant molecular biologists for a long time. Each year we conduct field trials of mild drought induction by ridges in soybean in the same way as in the paper, and we hope to find many new and important mechanisms in many more years of data. We would appreciate your continued advice, comments, and guidance. COMMENT 2 I do have a couple of points that I believe the authors could discuss in more depth. In their ridge trials, the geometry of the soil may play a role. Phosphate starvation induces a lot of lateral roots close to the soil surface, to maximise phosphate capture. In the ridge set-up, lateral roots are restricted to only a single plane. Is it possible that this contributes to the PSR in ridge-grown plants? It is also possible that increased rooting depth under mild-drought treatment also reduces phosphate uptake. If the authors see a reduction in PSR gene expression after re-watering ridge plants, this may help to rule out geometric explanations. It should be noted that the pot experiments do already indicate this to some extent. RESPONSE 2 Thank you for your interesting comments. Since the beginning of the ridge system, we have always carefully examined the possibility of unintended effects, such as changes in root morphology, caused by mild drought in the ridge system. In this light, we showed that irrigation compensates for the growth reduction caused by ridges (Fig. 2) , suggesting that various factors, such as slight changes in root shape due to ridges, are not substantially affected. As you also mentioned, we also used pot tests to substantiate our conclusions, as it is sometimes difficult to perform detailed molecular physiological analyses using only ridges. We therefore have analyzed Pi and ABA levels and PSR gene expression after re-hydration from pot tests with different plant species and soil types and have obtained results that can rule out geometric explanations, which we will update soon. COMMENT3 I am also not so sure about the authors’ conclusion on why PSR is induced at mild drought but suppressed under severe drought “Under severe drought conditions, given the circumstantial evidence, our observations would support the notion that PSR induction is suppressed by a relative increase in Pi concentration due to a decrease in leaf water content (Fig. 4).” I would argue an alternative, more straight forward hypothesis, that plants simply prioritise drought stress over this level of phosphate starvation when drought is severe. Would the authors expect to see a recovery of the PSR if Pi levels dropped even lower? RESPONSE 3 Thank you for pointing this out. We have also analyzed Pi and ABA levels and PSR and ABA-responsive gene expressions in response to changes in soil moisture content to demonstrate whether this hypothesis is true and will update the data soon. Research on the link between PSR and mild drought is just getting started, so future in-depth studies may provide data to support your hypothesis. COMMENT 4 Once again, thanks to the authors for their very through-provoking study! I look forward to hearing from you, Scott RESPONSE 4 We greatly appreciate your great interest and appreciation of our work.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.08.519701v1#comment-6183573515,biorxivstage,1,"Dear Dr. Wade, Thanks to you and the graduate students for the comments. These are really insightful, and I am so appreciative of your deep reading of our manuscript. You bring up some really valuable points, which I’ll respond to here. 1.	The discrepancy in global gonorrhea incidence was an oversight on our part – the newest statistic is 86.9 million cases (Unemo, M. et al. Gonorrhoea. Nat Rev Dis Primers 5, 1–23 (2019)). This is corrected in our peer-reviewed PLOS Pathogens manuscript. 2.	Working with primary human cells means that we sometimes see variability in results, which you can see from the range of data points for OpaD + serum at 60 min in 1A, some of which fall in the range of ~30%. We rely the internal controls of untreated OpaD+ Gc, as well as Opaless Gc, to make meaningful conclusions about the effect of serum on Gc survival. 3.	I agree the experiment should be done and would be very interesting! We didn’t have chimpanzee serum on hand at the time these experiments were conducted, but I think it would be a great follow-up. Chimpanzee C4BP binds to Gc with the PorB.1B genotype, so I would expect that chimpanzee serum likely phenocopies human C4BP in terms of suppressing Gc-induced neutrophil ROS, enhancing Gc survival from neutrophils, and limiting internalization of Gc. 4.	Your speculation is correct about 5f and I apologize for the lack of clarity. Our point with 5f is that if Gc associates with neutrophils, it is taken up regardless of serum or C4BP. This helped us build our model where C4BP is likely sterically hindering Gc neutrophil association upstream of phagocytosis, as opposed to inhibiting cellular processes related to phagocytosis, such as actin rearrangement. 5.	Yes, C4BP retains functional activity after exposure to temperatures up to 95 ˚ C and extreme pH conditions (Kask, L. et al. Structural stability and heat-induced conformational change of two complement inhibitors: C4b-binding protein and factor H. Protein Science 13, 1356–1364 (2004)). You are right that stating this would help the reader see how the data in Figure 1D are consistent with our eventual identification of C4BP. 6.	To be honest, anion exchange is the method that worked. It was actually suggested to me at a group meeting and a collaborator in chemistry lent us some columns. We were pleased to see that each elution (especially the 200 and 400 mM fractions) contained similar amounts of protein content, but had different collections of bands when resolved on a gel, suggesting that we were getting good serum protein separation (which was not the case with size exclusion; when we resolved the >100 kDa fraction on a 4-20% gel, it looked very similar to full serum). Essentially, we needed a way to narrow in on a smaller subset of serum proteins, and anion exchange chromatography allowed us to do that. 7.	A great question about the significance of this work. We don’t fully know, but I’ll say the following: a.	First, it’s important to note that despite promoting neutrophil activation, expression of CEACAM-binding Opa proteins, like OpaD, also provides significant advantages during Gc infection. Opa-CEACAM binding promotes gonococcal adherence to epithelial cells in the upper and lower genital tract and suppresses epithelial exfoliation, facilitating long-term colonization. We don’t know if C4BP would disrupt these advantageous Opa-CEACAM interactions, similarly to its interference with the disadvantageous interaction with neutrophils, like we show in the paper. b.	Suppression of neutrophil activity against Gc during infection could have two outcomes that are not mutually exclusive. It could 1) promote Gc colonization, and/or 2) limit the inflammatory damage associated with long-term complications of gonorrhea like PID, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Future experiments in a transgenic mouse model will hopefully shed light on this. c.	Does C4BP place among other processes that prevent killing by neutrophils? – I think the together, its complement-dependent protection of Gc – resistance to complement-mediated lysis and opsonic neutrophil phagocytosis – and the newly uncovered complement-independent function – resistance to Opa-CEACAM dependent (non-osponic) phagocytosis – suggests that it does. There is significant evidence that despite the multitude of ways that Gc resists neutrophil killing (i.e., manipulation of phagosome maturation, degradation of NETs, defenses against oxidative and non-oxidative antimicrobials), Gc is still quite susceptible to killing inside the neutrophil. Thus, the ability to resist neutrophil phagocytosis, both opsonic and non-opsonic, is critical for Gc survival.",2023-05-12T19:43:29,disqus_Kk58kEtHZL,Lacie,10.1101/2022.12.08.519701,Neisseria gonorrhoeae co-opts C4b-binding protein to enhance complement-independent survival from neutrophils,"Lacie M.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.30.534874v1#comment-6183552789,biorxivstage,1,"The following is a review compiled by graduate students participating in the Infectious Disease Journal Club, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University at Albany, SUNY, USA: This paper uses computational analyses of bacterial genomes to determine the distribution of anti-phage defense systems in actinobacterial species. The authors look at the diversity of defense systems, their enrichment in actinobacteria relative to other bacterial clades, and their genomic location. The authors suggest that some defense systems are enriched in the genomes of actinobacteria relative to other bacterial clades, while other systems are de-enriched. The authors also show that different defense systems are encoded in different regions of Streptomyces chromosomes, suggesting differential importance in phage defense. The fact that many defense systems are found more or less frequently in actinobacteria versus other bacteria, including some defense systems being completely absent from actinobacteria, highlights the fact that previous searches for defense systems have likely been biased in terms of the species used. The paper is well written, and with a few exceptions, the data are clearly presented. The analyses seem appropriate for the questions being asked. However, there is a concern that the genomes used are in some cases heavily biased towards individual species, most notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This bias could lead to erroneous conclusions about the relative abundance of some classes of defense systems in actinobacteria. Major comment The species used for Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria are not representative of the phylum in each case. For Actinobacteria, ~9% of genomes are from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For Proteobacteria, ~19% of genomes are from Escherichia coli and ~15% are from Klebsiella pneumoniae. This is especially problematic for M. tuberculosis, a species for which there is very little variation across strains. Some analyses may be influenced by these biases in the genomes used. For example, Figure 1B shows data for mycobacteria, but ~55% of the mycobacterial genomes analyzed are from M. tuberculosis. In Figure 1E, enrichment of gp29_gp30 is likely to be strongly influenced by M. tuberculosis genomes; this is a rare defense system that happens to be found in most M. tuberculosis genomes, so it likely appears a lot more enriched in actinobacteria than it really is. The same problem likely applies to other systems that appear enriched in actinobacteria. The analysis in Figure 1D will be heavily skewed by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. We recommend that the authors include only one genome per species. This will reduce potential biases. The authors should also include some text to highlight that biases in which genomes are sequenced may lead to biases in their data, since biases are inevitable based on the availability of genome sequences. Minor comments 1. In the Introduction, it would be helpful if the authors could include a few sentences to describe what is known about the defense systems that are discussed most frequently in the paper, i.e., RM, Wadjet, CRISPR-Cas and Lamassu. 2. In Figure 2, could the authors show the same species in panels A and B? This would be less confusing. 3. Can the author’s speculate a bit more on why some BGC’s cluster at the ends of chromosomes? 4. Figure 1 legends for 1C and 1E are flipped. 5. In the Conclusions section, the authors discuss the possibility of undiscovered defense systems in Actinobacteria, given that the DefenseFinder program can only detect systems that are already known. Can the authors describe how novel defense systems could be identified based on their data for actinobacteria? 6. Figure 1D is confusing and does not indicate which systems are more/less abundant. The data would be better represented in a form similar to Figure 1E. 7. Figure 2B shows some examples of defense islands. Can the authors comment on the frequency with which defense systems in actinobacteria cluster in defense islands, and how this compares with other bacterial clades? 8. In Figures 3A and 3B, it is difficult to tell which systems are being shown in each concentric ring. Perhaps the authors can point out the few defense systems that are widely conserved. 9. The colors of bars in Figure 1E should be described in the legend. 10. For Figure 3C, it would be informative to show data only for Streptomyces, and to indicate in that plot which defense systems were inferred using Pagel’s lambda to be horizontally acquired. 11. Figure 3C considers only plasmids and prophages as mobile genetic elements. Can the authors look for other types of element, e.g., transposons? 12. It would be helpful to include a list of gene families for each class of defense systems analyzed. If DarTG includes toxin-antitoxin systems that are abundant in M. tuberculosis, the authors should mention that. Suggestion for an additional analysis The authors have generated a rich dataset of defense systems in actinobacteria. They could use this dataset to look for candidates for novel defense systems using a “guilt by association” approach, i.e., look for gene families that are enriched in their proximity to known defense systems.",2023-05-12T19:14:21,disqus_y9FR6hyg5J,Joseph Wade,10.1101/2023.03.30.534874,Genomic characterization of the antiviral arsenal of Actinobacteria,"H.

I am certainly no historian of science, so perhaps there have been prior claims that this data refutes that I am unaware of. However, to me, no matter which way you look at the data, your sample suggests that males are indeed larger than females in most mammals. Instead of the approach I previously described, one could alternatively drop the species in the ""same size"" category under the justification that they have high uncertainty as to whether mean male size is larger than mean female size. After parsing your sample down, you'd still have more than 2.5 times as many mammal species in which males are larger than females on average, in cases where uncertainty is low. Of course, measuring more individuals of these species and including more species could change these results. There might be interesting phylogenetic patterns too. However, I still don't know what numbers are being looked at to draw the central conclusion. The fact that the 44% ""larger males"" category is less than 50% does not seem relevant to me in light of the points I raised about what the ""same size"" category actually includes. Therefore, the title does not seem to fit the data. My intention here is not to be obtuse; I am considering future work on bird body mass dimorphism that would be interesting to compare with your dataset, hence my interest.

Lovelace1, Sarah Pottinger1, George Seddon-Roberts2, Emma Turley2 1 The Sainsbury Laboratory, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, UK 2 The John Innes Centre, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, UK * All authors contributed equally to the review and are listed in alphabetically based on last name Overview At the time this paper was posted to Biorxiv, it was the first to report single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of plants during infection and therefore is of great significance and interest to the microbe-plant interactions community. The authors use scRNA-seq to compare cell populations from Arabidopsis thaliana during mock or pathogen infection by the Pseusomonas syringae. Through this comparison, they identified a distinct subset of cells that are responsive to this bacterial pathogen. Through pseudotime trajectory analysis they demonstrate that cells transition from an immune state to a susceptible state. From this analysis they identified known and unknown marker genes for these two states and characterized them through promoter report lines. Using confocal imagery, they evaluated these reporter lines during infection over both time and space. Together the authors uncover the herterogenity during pathogen infection and this dataset is a great resource to the community. We all enjoyed reading and discussing the manuscript. Overall, the manuscript is well written, and the findings are novel and exciting. The bioinformatics analysis is robust and consistent with previous scRNA-seq methods. However, the methods used to obtain these cells for scRNA-seq provide limitations to their interpretations and should be addressed. Below, we include some general comments as well as some specific comments/questions for some figures that came up during our discussion. We hope the authors find these useful. General Comments The authors use the tape sandwich method to enrich mesophyll cells from mock and infected tissue; however, by removing the epidermal layers this overlooks the first line of defence in a natural P. syringae infection. This biases the scRNA-Seq results making it difficult to draw correlations with their seedling infection assays which aim to characterize immune and susceptible maker genes identified through these results. The authors misinterpret the trajectory analysis where they correlate time with pseudotime. They state that their susceptibility gene expression analysis at later infection is consistent with their pseudotime trajectory analysis; however, their scRNA-Seq analysis was only performed on one time point. As such pseudotime may be more analogous to spatial distance from the infection site. The authors performed limited spatial characterization experiments of their marker immune and susceptibility genes to support their pseudotime analysis. Lastly, a major concern of ours is the low number of cells and seemingly one biological replicate sample used to produce this data. Their data would be more robust if more biological replicate samples were used and more cells were sequenced. Specific Comments by Figure Overall maintaining consistent use of colors across figures will help especially when red is associated with immune and blue for susceptible in figure S3 but the opposite for Fig 2 Figure 2 •	Immune and susceptible labels could be added to panel A, so as to make the graphic easier to understand. •	Additionally, the clusters M1-M5 are difficult to distinguish from one another in panel A. It is not clear what the colored labels in panel B are for. •	The authors used an unsupervised trajectory analysis in which the starting point they used was other. Does the same trajectory play out if they changed the starting point to a different group of cells? Figure 3 •	The authors state “The expression of all immune markers was significantly reduced at 72 hpi when plants exhibited chlorosis and water-soaked symptoms (Figure 3C and 3D)” but there are no pictures of these symptoms in this figure. •	The authors state that LipoP1 is expressed in guard cells in the absence of infection yet no stomatal markers were used to demonstrate this in panel C. Figure 5 •	Focus on substomatal cavities, yet no use of stomatal marker genes, which might make localisation more convincing. Figure 6 •	While the top section of this figure is very helpful, we felt that the lower panel including the line graph might be confusing to a reader. Figure S1 •	Suggested that ΔhopQ was no different to the WT Pst DC3000 in terms of infectivity, but could infect both N. benthamiana and A. thaliana. Why was ΔhopQ used in downstream analysis if no N. benthamiana infection models were used? Figure S2 •	Scaling of panels A and B might be misleading, as the scale of panel A is ten-fold larger than that of panel B. •	Panel C doesn’t contain a statistic on the figure. There is a figure (without a p value) in the text, but this makes the figure harder to evaluate. •	Panels G-N contain a lot of darkness, making correlation difficult to discern. Perhaps removal of cells with a value of 0.00 would make the panels easier to read, as well as making patterns easier to identify. The authors state “that the vast majority of cells profiled in this study are similar in cell type as those profiled by others”. Based off the methods used by the authors, the majority of the cell types are mesophyll and in other methods used this would also be the same given that mesophyll cells have a larger representation in leaf tissue. However, many cell types are missing from the authors data which is difficult to see using the visualization methods provided. •	Panel D has no y-axis label. •	What function does panel E serve? With the amount going on in this figure, perhaps it could be excluded if it is unnecessary. Figure S3 •	Hard to see assigned clusters on panels A-C. Perhaps an overlay similar to Figure 2A would be advantageous. •	What does each cell in panel B represent? There seems to be too few to represent each individual cell from RNA-seq dataset. •	In panel D, perhaps GO terms should be clustered grouped based on expression in each cluster. A dot plot might also illustrate data better. Figure S4 •	This figure is quite difficult to decipher and might be more easily interpreted as a Venn diagram. Figure S5 •	Pseudotime trajectory should be labelled more clearly, with clear labelled transitions, so that cluster states can be more easily assigned. Figure S6 •	There is no second rep for FRK1. Why is this? •	The authors state that LipoP1 is expressed in guard cells in the absence of infection yet no stomatal markers were used to demonstrate this.",2023-05-11T14:02:47,disqus_EzIt2lfC5H,Amelia,10.1101/2022.10.07.511353,Single-cell profiling of complex plant responses to Pseudomonas syringae infection,"Jie Zhu, Signe Lolle, Andrea Tang, Bella Guel, Brian Kvikto, Benjamin Cole, Gitta Coaker",2023-03-06

Reviewed by Adrian Treves, PhD Professor of Environmental Studies, Founder and Director of the Carnivore Coexistence Lab, University of Wisconsin-Madison +1-608-890-1450 http://faculty.nelson.wisc.... (which includes full disclosures of potentially competing interests in the CCC.php page) Direct inquiries to atreves@wisc.edu 11 May 2023 I appreciate that Dr. Petracca and colleagues posted their manuscript to a preprint server to facilitate independent review and scientific debate. Such preprints are a healthy step in our field to improve the reliability of science. Also I acknowledge the risk posed by preprints, such as policy-makers or the public running with results or inferences before they have been approved by qualified peer scientists. I think two aspects of the preprint process guard against such undesirable outcomes: (a) peer reviews attached to the preprint as a comment should serve to caution against such precipitous use of preprints, and (b) the authors can reinforce the need for caution in subsequent revisions to the preprint, even citing their pre-reviewers. The science-policy interface in which this work lies is fraught with difficulties. Also I acknowledge these sorts of models are complex and difficult to parameterize realistically with confidence. None of my comments or criticisms below are meant to undermine the hard work put in, but rather they are meant to improve the final product, improve outcomes for wolves, and improve the policy that may result from applied research. Thanks in advance for reading my comments in that spirit. I have chosen not to cite much research below, instead calling the authors’ attentions to our website (above) where peer-reviewed substantiation of all my assertions can be found. I welcome peers’ emails to atreves@wisc.edu if anyone has trouble finding the evidence. Most of my comments relate to Tables 1 and 2 and the associated scenarios. A question about Table 1: the caption includes ""Lethal removal rate was calculated directly from state agency records."" Please provide those with annual numbers and locations (East or West) to help the reader understand the geographic and spatial context of that assertion. The annual lethal removal rate was a single point estimate of 0.04. I don’t understand why this was treated as a constant not bracketed by annual variability? Later, the authors wrote ""In scenario 1 (“Baseline”) we simulated all relevant factors, as described below, at levels observed in the data collection period (2009-2020)."" All factors include those affecting the human-caused mortality, right? There are numerous studies documenting a variable annual rate of lethal removal. There seem to me to be other issues with assuming a constant annual lethal removal rate in baseline and the scenario for increased removals below. The assumptions that seem to be made about constant annual lethal removal in the baseline or the increased removal scenarios might be summed up as ""livestock losses will never get better or worse so long as the current rate of removal is applied randomly to wolf packs and entire packs are removed."" I don’t mean to caricature the assumption, I mean to make it plainer so it can be scrutinized. 1. If lethal removal is assumed to be effective in preventing livestock loss as WDFW has implied in the past, then it seems surprising that the model would treat it as ineffective or needing constant renewal. Can this be justified scientifically and by reference to articles that have not themselves been undermined by subsequent work? I call your attention to recent reviews of the literature on lethal removal which indicates unpredictable effects of lethal removal of wolves, resulting in increases, decreases and no change in livestock losses depending on study and site and years (the latter of no effect in the majority of cases, see studies of wolf removal by Grente, Krofel, and Santiago-Ávila. 2. Is predation on livestock random? If not, how does the imposition of a random scheme affect the model (a sensitivity analysis would be useful); many studies reveal that predation on livestock is not spatially random or uniform. Rather livestock losses are sometimes highly predictable from spatial features and wolf pack demographics. Therefore, I also call your attention to risk models that are analogous to resource selection functions, which have been used to model livestock loss in our region among others (see my lab website and search for ""risk"" and ""forecast"" please). 3 . Has WDFW lethal removal eliminated entire packs and in what percentage of cases? This baseline information might be helpful in interpreting the scenarios. I discuss partial or entire pack removal further below. I was confused by the increased removals scenario and the harvest scenario. Given they are differentiated I have to assume increased removals is NOT public hunting, trapping, hounding, etc. It is unclear what conditions might lead to such an increase in lethal removals. The authors wrote ""In scenarios 4 and 5 (“Increased removals”), we simulated an increased number of lethal management removals such that 30% of the wolf population[*] would be removed every four years, corresponding to an annual removal rate of 8.5%."" Does this replace the baseline removal rate or supplement it? I didn’t see a scientific justification for the value of 30% and I don’t understand where 8.5% came from (30 /4 = 7.5%). Even if I add the baseline it does not reach 8.5%. I’m sure I’m missing something but the calculation could be clarified. Another concern about this scenario is that it uses a flat mortality rate (% of population) regardless of conditions. That seems to simulate population reduction (sometimes called culling) but applied randomly to entire packs. Given that is a highly unusual pattern of management, it would help to understand the rationale behind it. See below where other more common scenarios are NOT considered. Therefore, I do not understand the criteria applied when selecting scenarios that deserve modeling and scenarios that do not deserve modeling. ""Harvest"" See issues with terminology in the section on Minor comments below. Every 6 months: This is an unusual off-take pattern. Readers may be tempted to assume that the policy-makers among the authors or their superiors in state agencies are planning two seasons of wolf-killing per year. The authors might wish to address why such an unusual wolf-killing system was included in this paper. Also, the method that allows only adults or juveniles yet simulates twice-a-year 'harvest’ assumes the public can avoid killing pups. Is there evidence for that assumption? The assumption seems dubious on its face but regardless it requires some consideration of methods of 'harvest’ and accidental non-target killing. Additive: While this is more conservative than any compensatory scenarios, it still does not acknowledge the many sources of evidence for super-additive mortality when the public begins killing wolves: Creel, Vucetich, Chapron, or when wolf-killing is liberalized in general: Santiago-Avila, Louchouarn, Suutarinen, Liberg, Treves. There are now more than ten studies quantifying the super-additive effects on population dynamics or the undocumented losses of wolves when killing is liberalized (I.e., undocumented deaths that can be attributed to policies of liberalized killing). The OMISSION of any alternative scenario with super-additive mortality and the OMISSIOn of alternative scenarios with increases in illegal killing triggered by the harvest and increased removals scenarios are problematic. I capitalized the word OMISSION to emphasize that they are not scientific decisions but value-based decisions about which scenarios to publish and which not to publish. Value-based decisions are akin to unstated assumptions derived from personal or organizational preferences / beliefs / policies. Assumptions about parameter values or interactions between variables should be transparently stated and usually justified scientifically. Unstated assumptions in a modeling paper seem to me to be scientific missteps because the range of possible parameter values was circumscribed for reasons that are not transparent or justified by peer-reviewed research. Also, please note that an attempt to scientifically justify circumscribed parameter values might require an even-handed summary of evidence for and against the assumed constraints on parameter values. For example, the increased removal scenarios (currently unjustified) might be paired with a lowered removal scenario or a scenario that curbs ongoing mortality sources such as poaching or vehicle collisions, hypothetically. To me it seems easier to evaluate alternative scenarios even-handedly than to justify the current ones. Furthermore, my concern is that the decisions about which scenarios to publish in the current manuscript leave unanswered 'why these scenarios and not others?' And the authors do not touch upon alternative scenarios for how wolf-human coexistence might play out differently. Instead, the scenarios presented in this paper are a subset of wolf-human coexistence and that subset is slanted towards negative views of wolves (more killing). For example, there is nothing scientific telling us to simulate lethal removal at level x or y. We explored this problem in sustainable use models in Frontiers in Conservation Science in 2021. My criticism is meant to be constructive as it is not too late to adapt your models to positive wolf-human coexistence scenarios, such as those involving provisioning to improve wolf reproduction or survival, increasing wild prey bases in regions with low prey, better enforcement against unregulated, human-caused mortality, use of non-lethal methods to protect livestock etc. I understand WDFW might never undertake such actions but that does not constrain scientists seeking approximations of reality. Also, administrations change, private actors / organizations sometimes step in, and background conditions change especially for a simulation run for 50 years. I hope you see how a subset of scenarios was presented for non-scientific reasons. Please remind readers that the selection of scenarios is value-based not science-based. Moreover, the selection of parameters within scenarios may also be value-based. For example, partial pack removals — simulated in your methods when ""excess"" removals are randomly assigned to another pack short of full pack removal — is NOT suggested to be effective in any study, even Bradley et al. 2015. Moreover, can the latter study even be used to justify the effectiveness of removal of entire wolf packs? I don’t think so. Consider that Santiago-Ávila et al. 2018 showed Bradley et al. 2015 was not reproducible until and unless the methods are clarified. Also, the 2018 article identified a possible statistical bias favoring lethal removal. If the data were to be shared (another hallmark of reproducibility), the bias minimized, and the methods clarified, one might argue that full pack removal has a scientific basis. But we’re not there yet. Because I noticed omissions of scenarios and circumscribed parameter values without explicit statement of assumptions and missing literature, I offer a comment on potentially competing interests. T The scientific community has changed position on this in recent years and is increasingly recognizing the potentially distorting effects of values and ideology on scientific research. Nothing is necessarily disqualifying but all should be disclosed fully and transparently. Ideological commitments expressed through memberships in civil society and professional societies (e.g., TWS or AFWA), institutional policy positions (e.g., WDFW’s current policies), and personal affiliations or rivalries, might all place pressures on individuals that reflect competing interests. These can affect the unstated assumptions, literature reviews (what is cited and summarized versus omitted) and the methods chosen and analyses used, in addition to the traditional issues relating to financial interests. I am not referring to one or two articles being missed but a pattern of omitting peer-reviewed research in highly ranked international journals as I noted here. I emphasize the issue of potentially competing interests as a way to inspire greater public confidence in the scientific endeavor. Thanks for your kind attention. Again I admire your decision to publish preprints so that pre-publication review has an opportunity to influence the future manuscript and perhaps public policy. Minor concerns Terminology: The term ""recovery"" has a meaning in US federal and state endangered species law as you all no doubt are aware. Recovery in its legal sense may lead policy-makers to shift regulatory schemes to down- or delist wolves. Therefore it is not a value-neutral scientific term and could be viewed as prejudicial. I see passages in your text where recover(y) is appropriate but others where it was used to refer to recolonization or population growth. There I recommend instead using recolonizing or geographic spread or numerical rebound which do not imply a legal status. This seems especially relevant when scenario outcomes suggest a low likelihood of achieving legal recovery. Relatedly, I recommend careful consideration of certain jargon words that may be mainstream in wildlife management but are not commonplace in ecological sciences or policy among all publics –  and may have value-based or moral connotations, e.g., harvest and depredation. In place of harvest I suggest ""permitted, regulated wolf-killing by the public"", because harvest is a euphemism that holds implicit assumptions about the values of wolves and motivations of humans who participate. To see why not to use 'depredation’, look at the first definition in the Oxford English Dictionary. I used it for years but now see the error. Finally, the discussion of non-lethal methods might benefit from updating to include studies since 2010 on livestock-guarding dogs, and systematic reviews of effectiveness 2016-2021.",2023-05-11T13:43:40,adriantreves,ADRIAN TREVES,10.1101/2023.03.23.534018,Forecasting dynamics of a recolonizing wolf population under different management strategies,"Lisanne S.

However, traditional sample preparation of thin cell sections is laborious and can introduce artifacts. In this paper, the authors quantify the sample damage introduced by cryo-FIB milling, a newer technique proposed as an alternative to traditional sample preparation. Although much has been done to understand how radiation damage affects particles in single particle cryoEM, the same cannot be said for understanding how cryo-FIB milling damage affects samples in cryoET. As cryo-FIB milling becomes more widely used, downstream workflows and data interpretation will be helped greatly by understanding the mechanism and characteristics of damage caused by cryo-FIB milling itself. This paper aims to characterize the damage caused by cryo-FIB milling by using a model system, the ribosome. The authors utilize a previous template matching method they developed, 2DTM, as a broad metric for comparing and quantifying damage. The major success of this paper is highlighting practical considerations for sample preparation based on quantification of damage from cryo-FIB milling. The major confusion we have with this paper is in interpreting the data for the mechanism of cryo-FIB milling damage, and whether alternate explanations for the data have been explored. This paper provides helpful insight into what one can expect from cryo-FIB milling their samples, and lays the groundwork for optimizing sample preparation. Major points We are unsure what new information the plots in Figures 1G and 1H provide relative to Figures 1E and 1F. It makes sense that the 2DTM SNR values plateau in the thicker lamella, as there is a larger region of undisturbed particles. However, because the 2DTM SNR is also included in Figures 1E and 1F in an untransformed and more intuitive coordinate frame, we are unsure what new interpretations come out of Figures 1G and 1H, and why this coordinate frame is necessary. Although Figure 3 shows that damage from FIB milling is distinct from typical radiation damage in cryoEM, the statement “This is consistent with a model in which the FIB-damaged targets have effectively lost a fraction of their structure, compared to undamaged targets, possibly due to displacement of a subset of atoms by colliding ions” currently relies solely on the use of 2DTM SNR as a measure. This could be more strongly supported by solving structures or 2D classes of LSUs from varying depths in the lamella to observe the damage. Solving these structures from the datasets and low pass filtering them to different spatial frequencies (as done in Figure 3) would be helpful to see if there are consistent changes at the molecular level that could explain the propagation of radiation damage as a result of displacement of atoms due to colliding Ga+3 ions. Figure 2A illustrates how variable 2DTM SNR values can be. Outlining potential workflows for experimental validation of this ribosome dataset and other datasets would be helpful for those wishing to benchmark cryo-FIB milling damage on their own particular system of interest. In the discussion section, the practical recommendation that particles more than 30 nm deep can be used for subtomogram averaging seems at odds with the earlier observation that damage can be seen up to 60 nm deep from each lamella surface. The 2DTM approach and the estimation of radiation damage relies on the reduction in correlation between the ideal, undamaged template and SNR. Can there by any other reasons for a reduction in this correlation other than FIB milling and/or electron exposure? e.g. stacking of multiple particles in Z-direction in case of higher ice thicknesses leading to reduced detectability. The fact that the damage makes it impossible to pick entire particles suggests that the scale of radiation damage due to Gallium ions makes the entire particle explode. Are there any instances in which you see differential damage meaning that only a part of the particle is damaged and the rest is intact? I would expect this since different parts of particle are exposed at different points along Y axis. Otherwise, it can be concluded that the damage is always of “whole” particles but there is no conclusion clearly stating this. This could be worth exploring. Figure 3F: it is well established that at low scattering angles, the electron scattering factors of negatively charged atoms can be negative. Was this considered when calculating the SNR from phosphorous atoms in the phosphodiester bond? Minor points In Figures 1G and 1H, we suggest using nanometers instead of Angstroms as the x-axis label. This will make it easier to interpret the blue dotted lines as the edges of the lamella. In Figure 1, it is unclear if “relative 2DTM SNR” of Figures 1E and 1F are exactly the same as “2DTM SNR” of Figures 1G and 1H. How does the 2DTM method take into account the radiation damage in template structure? Would it be possible to recapitulate the template model based on the known mechanisms of radiation damage due to exposure to electron beam during imaging so as to use a close to ideal model for template matching? It would be helpful if the rationale for selection of undamaged, ideal templates in 2DTM is explained in more depth. For example, are these from single particle cryoEM data with the minimum possible radiation damage or are they from other experimental techniques? What does the dotted line in Fig 2D represent? Why are there more outliers (outside the lamella thickness) in 120 nm sample (fig 1G) than in the case of 200 nm lamella? What does the existence of these outliers indicate? Are particles averaged over Y-axis in fig 1G and H? What is the error in measurement of electron exposure and how is it propagated in measuring the radiation damage? -Tushar Raskar, Daphne Chen, and James Fraser",2023-05-09T22:54:47,,Daphne ,10.1101/2023.02.01.526705,Quantification of gallium cryo-FIB milling damage in biological lamella,"Bronwyn A.

We manipulated chromosome 1q in four different cell lines - A2780, AGS, A2058, and MCF10A. In A2780 and MCF10A, TP53 is wild-type and the cells have a functional p53 pathway. In AGS and A2058, p53 is either mutated or non-functional. (I know that AGS is reported to have wild-type TP53, but we pulsed these cells with a DNA damaging-drug and they didn't up-regulate p53 targets, so either this cell line has acquired a mutation in TP53 or there's some other alteration in the pathway). There's clearly a strong interaction between 1q copy number and TP53 mutation status, as 1q gains are much more common in TP53-wildtype tumors compared to TP53-mutant tumors. However, there is still a significant fraction of TP53-mutant tumors with 1q gains, so there's probably some benefit for this aneuploidy that's p53-independent. We don't yet know what it is. Regarding the role of p53 in the 1q-regain events that we observed, it's an interesting question and we haven't done the experiment. p53-mutant cells have a weaker G2 checkpoint, so they might enter mitosis with unrepaired DNA damage or replication fork problems that promote chromosome missegregation.

This sentence was recently cited in an article in the NY Times with an unfortunate and wrong headline (""Why Does Bad Science on Covid’s Origin Get Hyped?"" David Wallace-Wells, 3/May/2023): Overall, across the full database of genetic material found in the market, the presence of raccoon-dog DNA was negatively correlated with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 material: When samples had more raccoon-dog genetic material, there was actually less SARS-CoV-2 than was found in other samples. An article in Nature (Dyani Lewis 04/May/2023) reports that ""there was no such association that made sense"" and ""In fact, the strongest associations were with species, such as fish, cows and goats."" I argue that most positive and negative correlations reported in this manuscript and in the Liu et al preprint (2022) do, in fact, make sense. Liu et al reported sampling rationale (Nature 2023. Extended data tables 2 and 3). Sampling on 1/Jan was largely premised on proximity to human COVID-19 cases with disease onset in mid-to-late December 2019. Sampling on 12/Jan was for ""environmental samples from stalls that sold livestock, poultry, farmed wildlife"" an examination of maps sampled stalls shows that sampling had little relation to reported COVID-19 cases. I reproduced the visualizations in Fig 5 and colored spots based on species category in the market context (e.g. human, meat, fish, wildlife). I additionally examined correlations for data from 1/Jan only. Examining 1/Jan and 12/Jan separately shows little correlation. What is left for 1/Jan is largely expected positive correlation from correlated error on 1/Jan for species with the high abundance on a day when there are no samples negative for viral RNA. It is only when combining 1/Jan and 12/Jan data, or when combining all sampling dates, that the reported correlations are observed with all parameter combinations: positive correlations for meat and fish, and negative correlation for some wildlife species. This is an artifact of combining sampling focused on COVID-19 cases on one day, with sampling focused to a large extent on wildlife sales on subsequent days. The expectation is that later samples will be lower in viral RNA because of lack of proximity to a COVID-19 case and also sample degradation. Lastly, for 12/Jan there is correlation for species disproportionately found in stall 6-29/31/33, with no known link to a human COVID-19 case, and later sampling shows that this was a reason for concern in February/March 2020. This is the stall with samples analyzed by Crits-Cristoph et al (2023). The 182 animal samples reported linked to this stall include rabbit (85), hedgehog (65), snake (24), bamboo rat (5), other (3). Unfortunately, there are no reported samples of animals linked to this stall from other species: raccoon dog, malayan porcupine, palm civet, and human.",2023-05-07T23:36:25,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,10.1101/2023.04.25.538336,Association between SARS-CoV-2 and metagenomic content of samples from the Huanan Seafood Market,Jesse D.

The authors clearly demonstrate that increased mitochondrial ceramide causes CoQ depletion and leads to insulin resistance. However, I believe some claims in the paper are somewhat over-interpreted, e.g. 'One possibility is that palmitate induces insulin resistance in L6 myotubes via a ceramide-independent pathway. However, this is unlikely as palmitate-induced insulin resistance was prevented by the ceramide biosynthesis inhibitor myriocin (Fig. 1A) and we observed a specific increase in C16-ceramide levels in L6 cells following incubation with palmitate, which was also prevented by myriocin'. Ceramide potently reduces membrane fluidity, so it could be that the pharmacological and genetic manipulations done in the manuscript results in altered mitochondrial membrane fluidity. As such, it is not a result of increased ceramide per se, but overall alterations of mitochondrial membrane properties. If I was a reviewer, I would suggest the authors to perform additional rescue experiments, particularly using membrane - fluidising fatty acids, such as oleate, EPA or DHA. I suspect that they might equally rescue palmitate-induced CoQ depletion and insulin resistance. Other than that, it is amazing work providing great insight into the core biological mechanisms driving insulin resistance.",2023-05-05T08:06:00,kasparaspetkevicius,Kasparas Petkevicius,10.1101/2023.03.10.532020,"Mitochondrial electron transport chain, ceramide and Coenzyme Q are linked in a pathway that drives insulin resistance in skeletal muscle","Alexis Diaz-Vegas, Soren Madsen, Kristen C.

Regarding snakehead fish, I also noticed this and looked closer. Reads are very rarely mapped for that species, confidence intervals are much wider for correlation, and it's negatively correlated with PCR. This is driven by a single sample (Q37) that is from the inside of a freezer in stall 8-25. I think this is the only sample with SC2-mapped reads not from stall 6-29/31/33 on 12/Jan. Similar story for another species identified in the same sample. Amur hedgehog, European hedgehog (unsure if this is a species expected to be found here), and Malayan porcupine have the highest correlation Spearman correlation for 12/Jan with what seems like sensible parameter choices. All also rank highly for correlation with PCR, as do goat and dog. Of course I agree that the data don't point to any one species and human reads being rare in one sample does not rule us out, either. However, I don't think that this is inconsistent with either of the news articles cited in the manuscript, with both articles including a variety of opinions on the strength of this evidence. Both articles correctly report that the data points to one stall that wasn't sampled based on a reported human COVID-19 case, that stall happened to have quite a few raccoon dog reads, and investigators in early 2020 clearly noticed this as well and collected 205 additional samples focus on this stall... unfortunately waiting quite a while to start.",2023-05-03T19:45:24,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,10.1101/2023.04.25.538336,Association between SARS-CoV-2 and metagenomic content of samples from the Huanan Seafood Market,Jesse D.

Below is a review compiled by the MICR603 ""Journal club in immunology"" at the University of Tennessee Knoxville: UTK MICR603 “Journal club in immunology” review of the paper by Gül et al. “Intraluminal neutrophils limit epithelium damage by reducing pathogen assault on intestinal epithelial cells during Slamonella gut infection” Summary: The work of Gül et al. investigates the role of neutrophil recruitment and activity on epithelial cell damage during Salmonella infection. They investigate this using several techniques including several in vivo models and microscopy. The authors investigate this from different angles by utilizing germ free mice that lack a resident gut microbiota and by investigating epithelial integrity and shedding during normal and neutrophil-depleted infections. Positive feedback: The authors provide an in detail review of what is understood during Salmonella infection and what is not during the different stages of infection in several different models. This provides solid reasoning for their use of several different model systems in this paper. Additionally, they are commended for their use of not only different Salmonella strains (wild-type vs mutants) but their use of different host models and antibiotic treatments to strengthen their claims and understanding of Salmonella infection and the role of neutrophils during infection. The authors use several different controls/treatments/previous studies to further back up their results and claims seen in this paper. For example, they further confirm their neutrophil depletion results by comparing against their controls as well as previous study results with neutrophil and monocyte depletions which takes away uncertainties that their results could be due to monocyte presence in the neutrophil depleted mice. Additionally, the use of experimental diagrams/design in figures is very useful when referencing other data in the figure. The authors are also commended on their use of microscopy to back up their data quantification and their flow and organization of figure panels. Major Concerns: •	4a- Antibiotic pre-treatment can greatly influence Salmonella invasion… every other figure/model uses streptomycin model and this one is using ampicillin (inconsistency with pre-treatment). Could you compare streptomycin and ampicillin results? Can they comment on what happens with ampicillin+WT treated mice? •	Were mice being placed in clean cages after gentamicin treatment? •	Gentamicin treatment: clarify if it was just in drinking water or during cecal tissue plating. A few sentences clarifying this is needed. •	Germ free mice: they interpret these as no bacteria in the gut, but they also have weird immune systems because of this. Would it be better to pretreat WT mice with antibiotic cocktail to deplete the residential microbiota without perturbing the immune system? •	How do you know the pad4 drug is working? Some confirmation here is needed. Minor concerns: •	The authors use the abbreviation “mLN” in multiple figures and their writing without defining what this is. It may not be clear to some readers what this is referring to. •	When referencing P values in the figure captions, it would be beneficial to state the actual P value and not just >/< in order to add more impact to the statistics.  •	5e- different microscopy planes : control is a cross section and neutrophil depletion is from a top plane of view •	5d - levels spelled incorrectly •	Why use pad4 inhibitor instead of pad4 deficient mice •	Pad4 inhibitor IP injection vs oral administration – reasoning for the use of one over the other could be better described. •	Controls in Fig1 are incomplete - no uninfected group and no isotype control group •	What is the dashed line in 1B? – Some further clarification is needed •	Conclusion: limitations of study needed •	1e: instead of quantifying with a 63X field of view they could use area metrics instead (more quantifiable) •	4 - B&C y axis - connect these units to whole organ so you can compare the bacterial load in lumen vs epithelial tissue •	Mention division time of salmonella in vivo / in vitro •	Speculate mechanism of expulsion? •	Do we know that these are intact cells in imaging",2023-05-03T13:45:00,,UTK Micr603,10.1101/2023.02.23.529832,Intraluminal neutrophils limit epithelium damage by reducing pathogen assault on intestinal epithelial cells during Salmonella gut infection,"Ersin Gül, Stefan A.

Pterin pigments create the color variation observed across butterflies as well as other species. However, there has been limited study of pterin and genetic variation in wild butterfly populations. Male C. philodice butterflies are observed to have yellow pterin expression while C. eurytheme displays orange pterin expression. Males are also known to have variation in UV-iridescence in both species. Both female C. philodice and C. eurytheme express a white phenotype since their pterin expression is reduced. QTL mapping across F2 hybrid males revealed a candidate gene red on chromosome 18 for pterin pigmentation variation. Mosaic knockout experiments on this gene revealed a decrease in pterin content, causing males to look more similar to the female phenotype, and significant disorganization of pterin granule structures. QTL mapping also revealed a second gene interacting with red, the transcription factor bab on chromosome Z, which had been previously documented to cause an increase in UV-iridescence, especially in females. Knockout experiments for bab in females showed a visible increase in UV-iridescence when viewed from a 30-degree angle, and increased orange pigmentation on the dorsal region and a variety of effects on other areas of the wings. The interaction between these loci controls an estimated 70% of pigmentation variation. Wing size is another trait that the authors hypothesized could be controlled by the sex chromosome. PCA analysis of male butterfly wing size distinguished between the UV-iridescent males and non-UV-iridescent males. When a QTL analysis was performed, the authors found significant markers at chromosomes Z and 2. Through two-QTL analyses, they found that 18% of size variation across males could be explained by an interaction between these loci. The combined data suggest that the Z chromosome plays a key role in intraspecific variation and distinguishing traits between C. philodice and C. eurytheme. The authors did an exceptional job of connecting pertinent and creative analyses to the conclusions drawn toward the end of each subsection, as well as the overall logical flow and organization of the manuscript. In particular, their usage of QTL analyses all supported the conclusions drawn with regard to the sex-linked component of the color trait. This was significant because it set up additional experiments on this Z-chromosome, such as the male UV iridescence experiments studying the bab transcription factor. This made for a much easier read and allowed the paper to build on itself through each of its analyses. Additionally, the presentation of the automated phenotyping experiments before any other data created a much needed visual background for the subsequent molecular analyses. Understanding the phenotypic variation under scrutiny was valuable for the comprehension of what followed, so this was certainly a major strength and a clever way to present information. The described logical flow is also rooted in the paragraph structure throughout the manuscript which made the paper much more accessible to non-expert audiences. For example, most paragraphs began with a broad introductory sentence describing a rundown of what was done in the section, followed by a more in-depth description of the experimentation and interpretation of their results. It is also worth noting that many of the experiments were very creative and yielded visually appealing analyses and highly convincing results. For example, the SEM analyses conducted on the red crispant scales added a fascinating visual component of microscopic phenotypic differences that correlate on a larger scale to observed variation in scale pigmentation. Having multiple levels of visual data lends well to the conclusion that the intactness of the red gene is necessary for most (not all, however, as in Alba individuals) wild-type pigmentation in C. eurytheme and C. philodice. Overall, the combination of experimental creativity, thorough organization, and logical flow all contribute to an interesting and well-executed manuscript. Major Point: As a broad note, one of the aims could have been tied together with the others more comprehensively. Specifically, we suggest that a more thorough justification of the wing size analysis is provided. While it was included in the introduction, it jumps out in the sense that it is only marginally related to the main focus of continuous color variation. Deepening the connection would serve as a much needed transition because, in the current draft, the wing size data appear to be added onto the end rather than an integral and interconnected part of the study. Part of the reason for this is that the other aims flow so well and appear in a logical order, while this experiment is almost ancillary. The experiment and accompanying analysis are still valuable and absolutely warranted in the paper, but strengthening the justification for their inclusion would go a long way in making the transition more seamless. Minor Points: Figure 1, legend, section H-I: “Agricultural site”, we suggest that these sites are specified. Figure 1J, legend: we suggest the inclusion of a p-value on the graph or in the legend. Page 6, paragraph 3: A period is missing at the end of the last sentence. Page 8, paragraph 5: “Marginally significant interaction”, we suggest a p-value be specified. Figure 3B: We suggest a p-value be included on the graph or in the legend. Page 10, paragraph 1: “...fused with other chitinous elements”, we suggested that the fusion be expanded on, as it is unclear without background insect knowledge. Page 12, paragraph 2: “Of note”, we recommend this be deleted or the wording changed. Page 12, paragraph 3: “...pterin pigmentation in females in a complex fashion…” we suggest the deletion of “in a complex fashion.” Figure 6, A-K: We recommend the use of the alternative transformed data from the supplement (using the purple, blue and pink color scale) or the inclusion of specific color swatches sampled from the images to to highlight the extent of the color differences that are not as visible to the untrained eye. In general, the alternative transformed data was more visually striking and helped us observe the differences more readily, so perhaps these can be incorporated throughout the paper while the raw images are placed in the supplement. Figure 6D: We recommend that the wild-type and knock-out regions are better highlighted by using a thicker black line to highlight the boundaries between the two. Finding ways to increase the amount of contrast in all of the figures containing wing images would be helpful, as there are a lot of the same colors next to each other. Figure 7A: We suggest a P-value be included either on the graph or in the legend. Page 16, paragraph 1: We suggest considering a rewrite of the first three sentences in the discussion section. There are a few run-on sentences that have too much additional punctuation, making it a little difficult to connect the sentences together without having to reread. Shortening the sentences would also make them a bit punchier which is more advisable for driving home a point. Page 22, methods on butterfly mapping broods: We suggest including the reason for selection of summer conditions, as well as perhaps the inclusion of how the winter conditions may affect the observed results.

I am curious what parameter combinations were attempted and how reasonable it is to call them ""cherry picking."" Sampling on 1/Jan was biased to locations known to be linked to humans recently infected with SARS-CoV-2 and is expected to show correlation between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and nucleic acids from both humans and species sold at these locations. Sampling on 12/Jan was biased towards locations known to be linked to wildlife sales without, as far as I know, reason to expect a positive SARS-CoV-2 result by PCR or sequencing. In my hands, the only ""cherry picking"" that is required is including samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 and not including sampling from 1/Jan when it was focused on locations of human COVID-19 cases. The result is that samples with reads for ""Amur hedgehog"" and ""Malayan porcupine"" consistently rank highly with any choice of parameters otherwise. This is also true if examining correlation between species reads and positivity by PCR. It is difficult to say it's ""cherry picking"" to focus on the one day with sampling not biased to locations expected to have reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2. However, I agree with comments by Débarre and Crits-Cristoph that this type of correlation analysis is problematic. In the end, in pointing to multiple species it points to one location.

The second figure is definitely much more informative than the first, and I agree with the general sentiment that categorical thinking is misleading when dealing with variables that are continuous in reality. That being said, the discourse on rates of sexual dimorphism in the literature is largely based on dichotomies/trichotomies, and we set out to test the commonly touted narrative of larger males being the norm in mammals (i.e., in this flawed discourse framed in terms of categories, does that narrative hold even on their own terms?). Our study is therefore seeking to estimate the rates of dimorphism in mammals, not looking for an effect of some variable on the degree of dimorphism, so effect sizes are not too relevant to our question. You are correct that the monomorphic category would include species with low dimorphism as well as high uncertainty in dimorphism. We mitigated for the effect of sample size on uncertainty by running an analysis on the relationship between sample size and confidence interval and cutting out all data with sample sizes lower than where the ‘elbow’ of the curve marked a transition from a rapid decline in confidence intervals with increasing sample size to a drastically diminished return in tighter confidence intervals with increasing sample size (see supplementary figure Fig. S1). That leaves a low degree of dimorphism and high variance in body size (in males, females, or both) as the major contributors to the monomorphic category, and we don’t see that as a problem. In our view, having high variance in body size should count towards an increased probability of being considered monomorphic, as it shifts the body size distributions of each sex into greater overlap. Breaking up that monomorphic group into those that fall just above or below zero difference in body size doesn’t make too much sense to me. As you say yourself, there is no expectation of a difference of exactly zero and that would not be a reasonable standard. One would expect for many mammals to be essentially monomorphic in body size (why wouldn’t there be monomorphic mammals?). I hear you on the significance testing and agree that it is usually an insufficient approach to draw inference from data. However, it happens to be amenable to the simple question we are asking in this paper since we are just interested in rates. Ideally, we would have raw data for each species that would allow for more nuanced analyses of the shapes of body size frequency distributions in males and females, but it was hard enough even just to obtain body mass means AND measures of variance for each sex for a large number of species. Further analyses of the data to explore degrees of dimorphism to answer other questions should definitely use more nuanced approaches.

Below, I attach my responses to each point with reproduction of the comment. Since these commentary is not capable of pasting modified visuals, added/modified visuals can be seen in the published version of the manuscript (doi: 10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01273) Comment: The manuscript by Zerze reports on molecular dynamics simulations of the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of FUS using a beta version of the coarse-grained force field Martini 3. The author performed simulations to study the formation of FUS LCD condensates under varying protein-water interaction strengths (in the Martini force field) and at different NaCl concentrations, and concludes that strengthening protein-water interactions by a factor of 1.03 improves the agreement with experimental transfer free energies between the dilute and dense phases. Additionally, the author concludes that the NaCl concentration affects condensate morphology and protein-protein interactions in the condensate, and that the effect of NaCl concentration on protein-protein interactions in the condensate is sensitive to rescaling of the protein-water interactions. The manuscript provides an interesting and novel benchmark of the (beta) Martini 3 model in predicting phase separation of IDPs, and reveals potential short-comings of the model in predicting protein concentrations in (or volumes of) the condensed and dilute phases. This benchmark will be useful for readers who wish to simulate liquid-liquid phase separation of IDPs with Martini 3, and the work will be interesting to a wider audience interested in the biophysics of IDPs and their condensates. Below we outline some questions and comments that the author might take into account when revising the manuscript. Our main comment regards a clearer assessment of the convergence of the simulations and correspondingly the lack of error estimates for observables calculated from the simulations. We also suggest a clearer presentation of the experimental data used to validate the simulations. While some of these changes are mostly textual, in other cases we suggest additional simulations. We realize that some of these simulations require substantial resources; if these are beyond what is available, we suggest at least to clarify caveats as per the points below. The author’s response: I thank the reviewer for their scrutiny and thoughtful comments that greatly helped substantiating the optimization analysis in the revised version of the manuscript. Comment: We have the following suggestions for revisions to the manuscript: 1) Fig. 1 and 2: The finding of non-spherical droplets is interesting and intriguing. To examine whether the formation of these shapes in the simulations with higher salt and λ-values represent stable states or perhaps trapped metastable states of the system, we suggest that: 1a) The author runs simulations with the parameters that give rise to non-spherical morphologies (e.g. λ=1.025 and 50 mM NaCl) starting from the structure of the spherical droplet (for example formed with λ=1.0 and no salt) and observe whether the non-spherical morphology is recovered or the droplet remains stable. If the droplet remains stable, then the effect of salt concentration on the inter-chain contacts (Fig. 6) could be assessed without potentially confounding factors from different dense phase morphologies. The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, I have performed an additional set of simulations for all λ values (1, 1.01, 1.02, 1.025, 1.03) at 50 mM salt concentration starting from a preformed spherical droplet. The initial condition with the preformed droplet is obtained from the last saved frame of the λ=1 simulation for 0 mM salt. We ran the simulations for 10 microseconds each. Within the given time frame the droplet remained stable for λ values 1, 1.01, 1.02, and 1.025 without a dilute phase concentration. I now added these findings into the supporting information (Figure S5). I also modified the main text (Page 9 last paragraph and Page 10 first paragraph) as follows: “Recent studies from independent groups show that the nonspherical droplet formation might be a kinetic arrest, playing an important role in droplet maturation and aging [51–53]. To test whether the nonspherical morphologies we observed are impacted by the initial conditions, we rerun 50 mM at all λ values starting from a preformed droplet (last saved configuration of 0 mM salt, λ = 1 condition). We simulated each λ for 10 μs and presented the analysis in Figure S5. Within the given simulation time, the initially spherical droplets stayed intact and spherical, except for λ=1.03, which had one copy of the FUS LC protein exchange back and forth between the dense and dilute phases). The enlarged droplet in the case of λ=1.03 also deviated from its initially spherical shape. These findings show that the nonspherical morphology was not reproducible for λ values less than 1.03 when starting from a preformed spherical droplet. We argue that the strength of effective protein-protein interactions at low λ are largely responsible from the initial spherical droplet staying intact.” Since the droplets stayed nearly spherical, I also analyzed the contact formation in these simulations (50 mM added salt, initially starting from a spherical preformed droplet) and presented the findings in Figure S7. I also discussed these findings in the main text as follows (Page 19, 20, the last paragraph before Conclusions): “Finally, we also examined the contact formation for the case of 50 mM added salt that starts from a preformed droplet (see Identification of condensate formation subsection for the description). As presented in Figure S5, we found that the initially spherical droplet remains largely spherical within the simulation time (never forms rod-like percolated structures) for this case. Therefore, this case helps us assess the effect of salt concentration on the inter-chain contacts without potentially confounding factors from different dense phase morphologies. Figure S7 shows both the contact propensity (A.) and the effect of salt concentration (B.) on the contact propensity. Figure S7A shows that the contact propensity decreases as the λ parameter increases, similar to the findings in Figure 5. Figure S7B shows, however, that the change in contact fraction with respect to 0 mM salt at λ = 1 is weaker (resembling λ = 1.02 at 50 mM salt in Figure 6A) although the salting out effect at high λ (λ = 1.025 and 1.03) are more prominent and stronger compared to those in Figure 6A.” Comment: 1b) The author shows time-series or distributions of an observable that reports on the dynamics of the proteins in the non-spherical droplet (e.g. Rg, mean square displacement, residue-residue contacts) and/or of an observable that reports on the dynamics of the droplet shape (e.g. the x-, y-, and z-components of the gyration tensor). The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we added the analysis of observables that reports on dynamics of shape fluctuations and size and presented them in Figure S4. We also modified the main text (Page 9, second half of the second paragraph) to discuss these findings: “We also investigated the time dependence of the size and shape of these morphologies by quantifying the radius of gyration (Rg) and the ratio of the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the gyration tensor (Figure S4). The latter offers a measure of sphericity of droplets. We found that low λ cases (λ = 1, 1.01, 1.02) at 0 mM salt have the most spherical morphologies. Beyond λ = 1.025 at no salt, the cluster formation is not tight (as evident from the Rg) so it also loses its sphericity. The condition that shows percolation (λ = 1 at 50 mM salt) has the largest deviation from the sphericity (it is rod-like instead) combined with a large Rg.” Comment: 1c) Additionally, independent replicas of droplet formation for each condition and parameter set would be ideal, but we realize that this would be expensive in computational resources and may be infeasible. The author’s response: We agree with the reviewer that the molecular simulations presented in this work are highly computationally demanding (e.g., a 10-microsecond simulation of one of these simulations at given salt and given λ takes about 25 days in terms of walk-clock time, occupying 28 CPUs and 4 GPUs) While it certainly is computationally demanding to replicate all λ parameters at all salt concentrations, we now rerun 50 mM salt concentration at all λ parameters where we start from a completely different initial condition (preformed droplet) for each. And we found that the morphology was not reproducible within the given simulation time at low λ, highlighting the initial condition dependence at low λ conditions. We now discussed this in the main text (Page 21, Conclusions). “We also note that we observed an initial condition dependence of the morphology at low λ conditions at 50 mM salt. This finding emphasizes the necessity of future work for exploring condensate morphology with proper advanced sampling techniques.” Comment: 2) “As λ increases, the volume of the dense phase increases (and condensed phase concentration decreases accordingly) until the system is not capable of forming a dense phase (λ >1.03)”: From Fig. 1 it seems that the rate of cluster formation decreases as λ increases. Is it not then possible that droplet formation at λ>1.03 is stable at equilibrium, but occurs on time-scales greater than those tested in the simulations? To support the statement that no droplets are stable at λ>1.03, we suggest that the author runs simulations with a higher value of λ starting from the structure of the spherical droplet (formed with λ=1.0 and no salt) to observe whether the droplet is dissolved or remains stable. The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have performed a simulation for λ=1.04 at no salt condition starting from the preformed spherical droplet (last saved configuration of λ=1.0 at 0mM salt) and we found that the droplet quickly dissolves for λ=1.04. This finding is now presented in Figure S3. The main text is also modified as follows (Page 9, end of the first paragraph): “To further verify that no droplets are stable beyond λ = 1.03, we also ran λ = 1.04 simulations at no salt conditions starting from a preformed spherical droplet (last saved configuration of λ = 1 at 0 mM salt). We then analyzed the cluster formation as a function of time (Figure S3) and found that the initial droplet dissolves quickly (at a timescale shorter than that of the formation of the droplets).” Comment: 3) Figure 3: The use of the radial distribution does not seem ideal for the droplets that have a non-spherical morphology, as certain distances will report on an average over the dense and dilute phases. This should at a minimum be discussed. The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added further discussion related radial density distribution to the main text (Page 12, first paragraph): “This approach works reasonably well for droplets that have spherical/ellipsoidal shapes. However, since the condensates for the conditions with finite salt concentrations significantly deviate from a sphere (they do not show a clear plateau as the center is approached), we used a surface reconstruction method [54] to estimate the volume and concentration instead of fitting the radial density profiles/using the limiting values.” Comment: 4) Table 1: It seems that the discrepancy between the sigmoidal fit approach and the surface reconstruction approach increases with λ, possibly due to sensitivity to the shape of the droplets, illustrating that there might be significant uncertainty associated with the reported dense phase volumes. We think it would be useful to have an error estimate for the reported dense phase volumes (e.g. an error over volume calculation approaches and/or over different probe sizes). The author’s response: The volume obtained by surface reconstruction is definitely highly sensitive to the probe size. To justify the size of the probe that I used, I directly compared the sigmoidal fit protein concentrations and the surface construction protein concentration calculated by different probe sizes (Figure S3 in the old SI, Figure S6 in the revised SI). Based on that comparison, probe radius 10 A was the size that minimized the differences considering all lambda values. That’s how I justified the probe size I used. For the uncertainty/error estimates, I performed block averaging analyses (please also see the response to the point 7). Comment: 5) Table 2 and Fig. 4: We suggest that the author more explicitly states which experimental data was used for comparison with the simulations in Fig. 4. We also suggest a more direct comparison with experimental data points where possible (e.g. by showing the experimental values of csat as a function of NaCl concentration). The author’s response: We used two experimental papers to extract the experimental data, one is reference 36. In reference 36, the authors state: “Using incubation on ice to increase the driving force for droplet formation followed by centrifugation to fuse the droplets due to their higher density, our 15 ml samples of 1 mM FUS LC phase-separated to form an ∼400 μl viscous, protein-dense phase stable for weeks at room temperature. FUS LC concentration in the phase is approximately 7 mM (120 mg/ml FUS LC) as determined by spectrophotometry.“ We note that the salt concentration is not specified in this case (or the authors obtained approximately the same protein concentration in the dense phase regardless of the salt concentration). Also, the thermodynamic conditions defined here does not exactly correspond to those in our simulations. That’s partly the reason why we looked for multiple sources of experimental data. The other experimental work that we used is reference 39. In reference 39, the authors state that “The relative intensity of the glutamine side chain residue NMR resonances in the condensed phase compared to a standard concentration (100 μM) dispersed phase FUS LC suggests a concentration of 27.8 mM = 477 mg/ml in the condensed phase.” The salt concentration in the corresponding NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C in 50 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl pH 5.5. The conditions do not exactly correspond to our thermodynamic conditions, either. Since an exact match is not available in the conditions, we did not prefer to present a direct comparison of dense phase concentrations, instead, we preferred to show a range in Figure 4. We now modified the main text (Page 15, right above the Contact Maps subsection) to more explicitly state the source of the data: “The experimental data range is referenced from the work by Fawzi and coworkers; [36,39] where reference [36] measures the FUS LC concentration in the dense phase as approximately 120 mg/mL (spectroscopically) and in reference [39], a 477 mg/mL FUS LC concentration is deduced from the relative intensity of the glutamine side chain residue NMR resonances in the condensed phase (compared to a standard protein concentration in the dispersed phase, which is given as 100 μM, or 1.71 mg/mL). 477 mg/mL FUS LC dense phase has been obtained from 15 ml samples of 1 mM FUS LC solutions [36] (from which we calculated the dilute phase concentration as approximately 14.3 mg/mL). We used these dense phase and their respective dilute phase concentrations to calculate the experimental range of transfer free energy (gray-shaded areas in Figure 4).” Comment: 6) “We used the “tiny” bead type (TQ1) both for Na+ and Cl- ions”: The author should clarify the reason for and possible effects of choosing the TQ1 bead type, as TQ5 is, we think, the standard bead type for Na+ and Cl- ions in Martini 3. The author’s response: We would like to clarify that tiny refers to the bead type being Txx. We then also would like to clarify that TQ5 type was not available in the MARTINI version that we used. Ion topology file in the version that we used only had TQ1 types as the ion type.

Comment: 7) We suggest that the author, where possible, reports error estimates for the various observables, for example from block error analysis and/or repeated simulations. The author’s response: We performed block averaging analysis (using two block) for volume estimation (accordingly, the protein concentration in the dense phase) and included the error estimates in Table 1 (Page 12). We note that for most 𝜆 parameters, the error was less than 1%. But we now added the errors larger than 1% in Figure 4. We modified the Table 1 caption as: “…. Statistical errors calculated by block averaging of the data (dividing the equilibrated data into two equal blocks) are less than 1% at low 𝜆 conditions. Errors larger than 1% are reported.” Comment: 8) It would be useful to include a discussion of the effects of simulation convergence and simulation starting configurations on the reported results. The author’s response: We added a discussion of the reproducibility issue and the initial condition dependence both to the Results and Discussion section and the Conclusions section (please also see the responses to the point 1a and 1c). Comment: 9) A discussion of the potential differences in the effect of non-bonded cut-offs in the dilute and dense phase would also be useful. The author’s response: We used a fairly large cutoff distance (1.1 nm) for short-range treatment of vdW and electrostatics but a potential nonbonded cutoff effect that I can think of is the long-range treatment of electrostatics. While vdW interactions are large power of r in denominator (therefore, negligible contribution to the potential at large r), we may argue that the long-range treatment of electrostatics might be a concern in general. It is well known that the simple cutoff of electrostatic interactions introduces artifacts on phase behavior of anomalous liquids that has two distinct phases [e.g., J. Chem. Phys. 131, 104508 (2009)]. Here, we applied the reaction field method for long-range treatment of electrostatics. In this method, a given particle is assumed to be surrounded by a spherical cavity of finite radius within which the electrostatic interactions are calculated explicitly. Outside the cavity, the system is treated as a dielectric continuum. Any net dipole within the cavity induces a polarization in the dielectric, which in turn interacts with the given molecule. The reaction field method allows the replacement of the infinite Coulomb sum by a finite sum plus the reaction field. One caveat of this approach might be the nonuniform distribution of the particles within the system (i.e., one protein-dense phase and one protein-dilute phase), which may jeopardize the assumption that outside the cavity is a uniform continuum dielectric. While this caveat may make the Ewald summation (or particle mesh Ewald, faster version of Ewald sum) look more preferable, we note that Ewald sum and reaction field techniques yield nearly identical phase behavior for liquid crystals (also nonuniform in nature) (see, Molecular Physics 92(4), 723-734 (1997)). We discussed some of these points in the main text as follows (Page 6, third from the last sentence): “Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using a generalized reaction field method [45]. We note that a long-range treatment of electrostatic interactions is essential to obtain accurate phase behavior [46].” Comment: 10) It would be very useful if the inputs/settings (including starting configurations) used for simulation and code for analysis were available. The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we uploaded the initial configurations and run files for all lambda values for 0 mM salt and 100 mM to GitHub and made it publicly available. We now noted in the availability of the data in the main text by modifying the last paragraph of Modeling subsection as follows: “Equilibrated initial conditions, topology files, and run parameter files for all λ values of 0 mM and 100 mM salt are publicly available on GitHub ( https://github.com/gzerze/m... Comment: We also have the following suggestions for minor revisions to the manuscript: 1) “We kept the protein-protein interactions unmodified (and no additional elastic backbone constraints were applied)”: The author should clarify whether this includes assignment of secondary structure and/or side chain angle and dihedral restraints (ss and scfix in Martinize). The author’s response: Yes, this would apply for any restraints (i.e., they would remain unmodified). This particular protein, FUS LC, is left fully flexible, without any backbone/side chain structure. We clarified this in the main text by modifying the relevant part in the Modeling subsection: “No elastic backbone (or side chain) constraints were applied (i.e., FUS LC is kept fully flexible). We kept the protein-protein interactions unmodified but systematically tested a range of scaled protein-water interactions.” Comment: 2) “All simulations were performed using GROMACS MD engine (version 2016.3).”: Error in references. The author’s response: The references are fixed. Comment: 3) In the Cluster Formation Analysis section: We suggest that the author cites the specific package used (e.g. SciPy). The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we added the name of the routine related references by modifying the relevant part in Cluster Formation Analysis subsection as follows: “Any two protein molecules are considered to be in the same cluster if any two beads of the molecules are within 0.5 nm (or less) distance from each other. Based on this criterion, we built adjacency matrices and then found the connected components by using the compressed sparse graph routines of public Python libraries [50]” Comment: 4) Fig. 2: There are small red dots on the droplets, which should either be explained in the figure text or removed. The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we remade the Figure 2 by removing the red dots. Comment: 5) Fig. 3: It would be useful for the reader if the NaCl concentration was labelled at the top of each column. Additionally, the radial distribution of the ion concentration is shown as two separate rows, which we assume corresponds to Na+ and Cl- ions. This should be clearly labelled. The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we updated Figure 3 with proper labels. Comment: 6) “We found the largest water fraction For the ionic species…”: Typo? The author’s response: We removed that incomplete sentence now. Comment: 7) Fig. 4: Depending on how the plot is updated with more details on the experiments, perhaps the range shown on the y-axis could be made smaller. The author’s response: Figure 4 is updated as presented above (please see the response to point 7 above). Comment: 8) Fig. 5: May be clearer with a colourmap with three colours, as in figure 6. The author’s response: Figure 5 uses a color scale that changes the colors uniformly from black to white. For contact maps (like Figure 5), since the range of change is sequential growth of fraction, we thought a perceptually uniform sequential color scale fits better as opposed to a divergent color scale (e.g. the color scale in Figure 6).",2023-04-30T15:24:14,,Gul Zerze,10.1101/2022.11.07.515502,Optimizing the Martini 3 force field reveals the effects of the intricate balance between protein-water interaction strength and salt concentration on biomolecular condensate formation,Gül H.

The comments are posted with this preprint in the hopes the authors post the updated version that we commented on here as the journal we are reviewing for does not place limits on updating preprints during the peer review process. Ashraya Ravikumar and James Fraser Summary : The traditional Ramachandan plot uses the ϕ and ψ torsion angles about the N-C𝛼 bond and C𝛼-C bond respectively to represent aspects of the three dimensional protein backbone structure in two dimensions. Some of the atoms involved in the calculation of ϕ and ψ torsion angles of a residue come from the adjacent residues in the protein chain. In this work, the authors consider the ψ angle of residue i and ϕ angle of residue i+1 as an entity and analyze the distribution of these amino acid pairs. Their approach has the advantage of the torsion angle pair being fully contained in an amino acid pair and the ease of representation of these pairs in the familiar Ramachandran like plot. The authors show that their cross peptide bond plot covers more area than the traditional ϕ,ψ plot and identifies certain structural elements that are “recurring outliers” using the traditional plot. They also show some differences in conformational preference between thermophilic and mesophilic proteins. There is an initial attempt at experimental validation, with small stability changes (measured by melting temperature) upon point mutations to amino acids more favored for that specific region of the cross plot; however, this validation is limited and would benefit from examples intended to be neutral and destabilizing. The major strength of the paper is a new concept that is very simple yet also powerful for identifying regions of conformational space that should be considered “valid”, not outliers. In doing so, their method provides a lot of scope for some interesting future work and new ways of validating protein structures, refinement procedures, and structure predictions. The major recurring issue in the manuscript however has been lack of clarity and lack of attention to detail, which can be improved in a future (third?) iteration of the manuscript. The major and minor points of concern are expanded below: Major points : 1. In Figure 1, the authors claim that “Standard secondary structures (such as left and right 𝛼-helices, 𝛽-strands and turns) are clearly recognizable” from the gray stick plots. While the 𝛼-helices are recognizable especially in clusters 12 and 19, it is not possible to identify 𝛽-strands and turns from these images. More amino acids may have to be added to the visualization on either side of the pair to make this clear. 2. Their analysis on the correlation of cross bond angles using MD simulations need more details and discussion. The text points to Figure 2 and Table S1 to show the correlation but Figure 2 simply shows the five structures which were simulated along with the amino acid pairs and the cross peptide bond plot. It is unclear how to interpret the correlation between ϕ(k) and ψ(k+1) from this figure. Also, their choice of proteins for this analysis seems arbitrary. What do they mean by “small” protein? What is the dataset of structures they started out with before randomly picking these five structures? 3. How do the authors claim that cluster 9 and 10 shown in Figure 4 represent a transition into helix? The ϕ(k+1),ψ(k+1) distribution is not indicative of being part of a helix. 4. The authors refer to Figure 5 in their discussion about the cluster 15 representing the Type II 𝛽 turn. The representatives of the cluster do appear in different structural contexts. But, are they all indeed 𝛽 turns? Do they satisfy other criteria to be called a beta turn - either distance between C𝛼 atoms of i and i+3 residue or H bond between carbonyl oxygen of i and amide hydrogen of i+3. This information is needed to support the statement that type II 𝛽 turns are also common in random coil regions. Also, Figure 5 caption says the representatives are from cluster 6, but we are assuming the authors mean cluster 15. 5. The authors have not mentioned what is the color scale used to color the nodes in Figure 6. We are assuming that warmer color means higher probability of the cluster being occupied by thermophiles. The clusters that are part of the most prominent transitions are very close to each other. Maybe many of the amino acid pairs from thermophiles that are classified into cluster 12 could be part of cluster 19 with some minor change in ψ or ϕ angle. Are the alphafold predicted structures accurate enough to distinguish between such close ψ,ϕ angles? These observations could also be a result of inherent biases in alphafold. Perhaps the authors could also analyze experimental structures of mesophiles and thermophiles to see if these trends hold. 6. The statement “Visual inspection of the most prominent cases suggests that the preferred clusters in thermophiles, presumably the more thermostable ones, are those which appear more ordered” is not well supported. If this statement is being made purely based on the cartoon representation of the two cluster transitions shown as inset in Figure 6, then it does not look convincing, especially 1 to 11. Perhaps the authors could analyze the extent of disorder in a more systematic way by comparing preferred clusters of thermophiles and mesophiles and quantitatively look at the difference in disorder, if any. The authors can also show specific examples of transition matrix along with pictorial representations of differences in angles/planes so that the reader can understand them better. 7. In the context specific mutation analysis, the differences in ΔTm observed are very small and the raw DSF data is not shown in the supplemental figure. Are these changes significant enough to conclude about the effect of these context specific mutations on protein stability? Additional experiments are likely needed to place these ΔTm changes in context. What is the typical change in ΔTm for a predicted neutral or deleterious mutation? Can anything be inferred based on prior deep mutational scans for GFP or another protein to help give this analysis more power? 8. Over the years, Ramachandran angle restraints have become part of structure refinement protocols, which when applied inappropriately, could lead to over-optimization of ϕ-ψ angles. For such cases a simple Ramachandran validation will fail to identify issues in the structure and needs a more global approach such as the Ramachandran Z-score ( https://www.sciencedirect.c.... From the way the authors’ approach is designed, it could have potential for a similar application. They have shown in Figure 3 how outliers of Ramachandran plot fall into acceptable regions in their cross-peptide bond plot. Along these lines, the authors should discuss about global validation metrics derivable from their method (perhaps related to the normalized marginal distribution distance shown in Figure 7) Minor points : 1. In the introduction section, the authors mention the disadvantage of the (ϕ,ψ)2 method. But apart from mentioning the protein blocks (PB) method, they don’t explain how their approach improves over the PB method. It’s important to place this work in context to PB since PB’s have been used for several structure related applications. Another related work is TERMs ( https://www.sciencedirect.c... where the protein structure is broken down into smaller structural entities which are then used to assess model quality, sequence/structure compatibility, conformational transitions, etc. The authors could discuss about the relationship of between their work and TERMs 2. The authors should add labels to panels within figures instead of addressing them as top, middle, etc. 3. What is the correct resolution cut off used to extract structures from PDB? Results and discussion says 1.8Å but methods say 1.5Å. Also, the authors need to provide the list of PDB structures used. 4. The authors have probably cited the wrong reference for the proteomes of mesophile/thermophile bacterial pairs in materials and methods 5.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.25.538336v1#comment-6172790273,biorxivstage,2,"In this preprint, Bloom re-analyses a dataset of metagenomic data recently shared on open repositories by Liu et al. (2023). A subset of these data, previously made available on GISAID, was also previously analyzed by Crits-Christoph et al. (2023) – of which we are co-authors. 1) Bloom’s analysis largely confirms the genetic identification of wildlife species by Crits-Christoph et al. (2023). The identification of animal species differed between Liu et al. and Crits-Christoph et al., in particular regarding the abundance of raccoon dog genetic material in sample Q61. Bloom’s analysis, done with similar but independent methods from Crits-Christoph et al., largely replicates their findings. A comprehensive Github repository allows any interested reader to conveniently check Bloom’s results by themselves. 2) The correlation analysis presented by Bloom contains numerous flaws. Bloom reproduced the correlation analysis initially presented in Liu et al. (2022), but Bloom’s analysis, as conducted, is inappropriate to answer the question of which animal hosts shed the viral material detected. Crits-Christoph et al. (2023) were missing data to carry out such an analysis, but warned against its use. Here we repeat and expand the arguments presented in Crits-Christoph et al.. These points would need to be taken into account for a correlation analysis to be valid, but were not by Bloom (and often just cannot be): a) The outbreak had been ongoing for weeks in the market when the samples were collected, and multiple humans had been infected. By then, most virus in the market will come from human cases, especially as stalls containing human cases were targeted first, when sampling was performed on January 1. The large number of samples from these stalls with sick humans will highly influence correlational analyses. As shown in Worobey et al. (2022) on similar data obtained via qPCR, both the distance from known human cases and the distance from wildlife stalls independently contributed to the spatial variation in viral positive samples. The number of human cases at the time of sampling means that even if infected animals were present at the market, an underpowered correlation analysis of the sequencing data would be unlikely to have revealed it. b) The correlation analysis treats all animals of a given species as an homogeneous group. There were however multiple stalls selling the same animal species, but likely not from the same supply sources. The presence of uninfected animals in one stall would affect the result of a correlation analysis, but would not invalidate the potential presence of infected animals in another stall. c) The samples themselves are not homogeneous: for instance, within-sample animal diversity is different when the swab was taken directly from fish packaging than from the ground. In addition, wildlife stall samples tend to be composed of a diverse menagerie of animal species RNA/DNA (a consequence of animals housed directly on top of each other and equipment shared between them), while samples related to human cases elsewhere in the market tend to be fairly simple. Therefore, by correlating abundances within just the positive samples, human-shed samples tend to have very high relative abundances for human DNA (or, e.g., human and fish), while animal shed samples tend to have lower abundances for any given species. This is a natural consequence of sequencing abundances being relative, not absolute. d) SARS-CoV-2 read counts can differ for multiple reasons: there can be different quantities of virus shed in the first place, and different times since virus deposition will influence detection, as RNA degrades over time. While it is not possible to precisely date the time of viral deposition, there are two important considerations. First, if wildlife introduced the virus first to the market, animal-shed virus would (on average) occur before human sheddings. Second, wildlife stalls were sampled multiple days after stalls with reported cases (January 12 vs January 1). Put together, this means there would have been substantially more time for virus shed by animals to decay than virus shed by humans. e) Virus presence is detected through RNA, host presence through mtDNA, which degrade differently over time. Relative abundances therefore depend on the time difference between when the different genetic materials were deposited and when they were collected. f) Stalls were sampled multiple times. A correlation analysis would need to take into account spatial proximity and in particular model the per-stall effect. g) The correlations reported in Bloom’s figure 5 are calculated solely on samples that contained any positive reads for SARS-CoV-2, and were therefore sequencing-positive for the virus. Therefore, this is not a test of which species were more likely to be in samples that tested positive for the virus, but how abundant each species was in the samples that did test positive. This is an important distinction. For these reasons, both positive and negative correlations are largely uninterpretable: -  A positive correlation is not indicative of infection. As an enlightening example (also highlighted in Crits-Christoph et al.), the most correlated species in Bloom’s analysis is a fish species that is not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. -  A negative correlation is not indicative of lack of infection (see above). 3) Some samples appear to be missing in the analysis, which contained high viral read numbers: A20, F13, F54. 4) Bloom chose to align reads to chordates’ mitochondrial genomes, but did not justify this choice. Only mammals are known to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, so an analysis of just mammalian RNA/DNA, as presented in Crits-Christoph et al., is most relevant to the question of which species may have shed the virus in a particular sample. If the aim was to provide a better picture of the diversity of animals sold at the Huanan market, all metazoa should have been included, to be able to identify seafood for instance (a key early case was a shrimp seller). However, the end result is that Bloom’s 20% chordate inclusion threshold for this table results in most of the samples with both wildlife RNA/DNA (e.g. raccoon dogs) and viral RNA being excluded. The claim that only one sample of all samples with raccoon dog DNA that contains SARS-CoV-2 is therefore inaccurate: please see the supplementary data of either Crits-Christoph et al. or Bloom et al. for comparative results on the true number of such samples (which is at least 5, depending on the given analysis). 5) Bloom’s comments on the definition of positive samples overlook the difference in sensitivity between qPCR and sequencing in environmental sampling: qPCR is highly sensitive, with near single molecule detection resolution, and correlates with the absolute load of the virus in the sample. Sequencing, however, is both less sensitive (even when deeply sequencing), and highly dependent on the quantity of what else is in the sample. Thus, it is very challenging to identify SARS-CoV-2 in samples sequenced from the environment without any kind of enrichment performed: this is because the virus is comparatively rare compared to abundant environmental microbes (bacteria, fungi) as well as DNA/RNA shed by animals and humans. This is why most environmental viral sequencing is done after performing a viral enrichment (either physical or amplicon). For a similar comparison of unenriched SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, see the supplementary table S1 of Crits-Christoph et al. 2021 (“Genome Sequencing of Sewage Detects Regionally Prevalent SARS-CoV-2 Variants”), where 5 unenriched samples with viral Ct values in the range of 30-32 were deeply sequenced, and only 1-17 SARS-CoV-2 reads were obtained. For this reason, we do not encourage using only sequencing data quantitative values and ignoring qPCR positive samples. There is no indication in the Liu et al. dataset that we have seen to indicate the qPCR results were impacted by contamination. Indeed, 112/116 samples that were reported negative for qPCR were also negative by NGS, indicating a high degree of agreement between the two approaches, and that qPCR is merely more sensitive. In addition, the definition of a positive sample cannot be done independently of the provenance of the sample: even at very low read count, the presence of other positive samples in the same stall at the same date is indicative of sample positivity. 6) Citations to news articles are vague or misleading. It would be preferable to stick to arguments presented in scientific documents, rather than rely on newspaper articles. a) As rationale for his analysis, in the Introduction of his preprint, Bloom claims that “Other scientists pointed out that if the raw data were shared, it would be possible to expand upon the analysis in the 2022 Chinese CDC preprint to determine if the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material correlated with material from other species (Cohen 2022a,b)”, where the two Cohen citations are news articles. The authors quoted in these articles (Robertson, Rambaut, Holmes) did not mention Figure 4a because they thought the analysis was useful enough to be reproduced, but because it was possible that other animals’ genetic material was present in the environmental samples, and these data were not shown. b) By conflating their views with misinterpretations of news reports written about their work, Bloom misrepresents the conclusions of Crits-Christoph (2023): Crits-Christoph et al. (2023) did not conclude they had found the intermediate host and it was raccoon dogs: their report clearly stated that they could not “identify the intermediate animal host species from these data”, and that the presence of infected animals was a “plausible explanation” for their results. And they explicitly stated that “the most abundant animal in the sequencing data of a particular sample is not necessarily the source of the virus in that sample”.

My comments are below: Sweeny and colleagues describe a method which identifies the location and conformation of small molecule ligands within cryoEM volumetric maps of ligand:target complexes in an automated manner, given an atomic model of the macromolecular target only. The method, named ChemEM, is shown to match or exceed the performance of existing, commonly-used methods in its ability to successfully locate and model energetically favorable and structurally accurate conformations of ligands. Such a tool will be of keen interest to structural biologists working on small molecule ligands, for example in the context of drug discovery projects supported by cryoEM. In such projects, protein:ligand co-structures typically have resolutions in the 2.5 to 3.6 Å range, leaving some ambiguity as to the exact position of ligand atoms, and thus the conformation of the small molecule and the details of its interaction with the protein binding site. The authors achieved impressive performance, as judged by well-defined benchmarks, by introducing several key features, including: (1) a carefully calibrated function to score the geometric and chemical plausibility of ligand and ligand-protein conformations, termed ChemDock (2) a measure of quality-of-fit carefully weighted relative to ChemDock as as to optimize performance in benchmarks (3) the use of mutual information (MI) rather than the more commonly-used cross-correlation coefficient (CCC) as a quality-of-fit measure (4) the use of difference maps rather than full cryoEM maps as input for the docking and initial conformational search In addition to point (3) above, the manuscript is replete with technical nuggets that will be of interest to those working directly in this field (e.g. the use of full vs difference map, the relative weighting of model-only vs model-map scoring functions and its calibration, the creation of cryoEM benchmarking sets). Overall, I found no major technical issues with the description of the work. I found the methodological details are well described, as are their tuning, benchmarking and validation. Most of the claims are well supported by evidence, and the results do appear impressive. The manuscript appears close to publishable to my eyes. I do have some suggestions for improvements: (1) I found the following were missing: A description of the software and end-user experience. What inputs are needed? What is the interface like? The authors claim that ChemEM is automated... is it truly fully automated in a robust way? How many parameters does the user need to adjust? For example, are difference maps calculated automatically by ChemEM? Are the maps filtered, or their spectra flattened or normalized in any way, before computing difference maps and MI?  Also, what is the performance like? Relatedly, the authors really should specify: How is the software available? How is it distributed? Under what license? Oh and also: does ChemEM handle covalent ligands? (2) Q scores (or equivalent metric) should be included when making comparative statements about the quality of (ligand) model-to-map agreement (e.g. Fig 6A, but Figs 5 and 6 in general, and references to them in the text, e.g. ""markedly better fit to the density than the cryoEM deposited structure"") (3) The abstract claims that SM docking into medium resolution maps is ""unexplored territory"". I don't think this is accurate. For example, the glideEM paper treats EMD-0488 (3.4 Å). (4) Introduction: the sentence which cites reference 2 seems inaccurate to me. As far as I could tell from a brief review of the cited work, it does not identify a novel drug target. GABA receptors were already known to be the targets of the small molecules studied in that paper. In general, I fail to see how higher resolution structures by cryoEM would help identify new targets (proteins) for small molecule drugs. In my opinion the suggestions above really should be addressed before publication. In addition the suggestions below would improve the manuscript further and may be acted upon if the authors/editors agree: (5) Up to the editor, but this is a very technical paper. It might be worth investing a few sentences here and there to help non-specialist readers along. For example, when referring to CASF-2016's ""funnel"" and the related decoy or ""RMSD"" ligand sets, or when first referring to mutual information. The non-expert reader likely will not know exactly what these are and some short descriptions may help. Generally, given the target journal, a bit more effort to write for a broader audience might be warranted. (6) Figure 4: perhaps label/title the figure panels themselves with ""Different maps"" (left column) / ""Full maps"" (right column) and ""Low-resolution maps"" (bottom row) / ""High-resolution maps"" (top row). And also, in the MI-only case with different maps - what was the initial conformation of the ligand (which I assume was held constant)? Was it a minimized-in-vacuum conformation? (7) A detail: I have a preference for avoiding the word ""density"" when referring to cryoEM maps, since they do not map electron density like x-ray maps do. (8) Abstract: to claim that automatically docking ligands is of ""utmost importance"" I think is an overblown claim. Automation is important in high throughput applications, such as fragment screening, but otherwise automation is just as desirable in ligand docking & refining as it is in protein structure building, which is to say (in my opinion) not of utmost importance. Accuracy is. (9) Abstract: ""ChemEM is a novel method"". I'm not dogmatic about this, I think it's OK to claim novelty from time to time, but in this case, only some aspects of the method are really novel, and I think the claim of novelty sounds a bit hollow because it is applied in such a broad stroke. In view of the quality of the results, it's not even necessary. (10) Abstract: The last sentence ""ChemEM unlocks the potential of medium-resolution cryo-EM structures for drug discovery""... Again this claim is actually really quite strong but sounds quite hollow in this case, at least to someone who has been doing medium-resolution cryoEM for drug discovery for some years. I would strike such boombastic language unless some more specific statement can be made about some type of experiment of projects that was not previously possible until ChemEM came along and is now ""unlocked"". (11) Signicance statement: is ChemEM already used in drug discovery?? Is it even available for download from anywhere? Maybe just say ""which can be used used in drug discovery""; ""In the last decade Cryo-electron microscopy"": the capitalization is unecessary here. Also, because the electrons are not cryogenic, I recommend using ""cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM or cryo-EM)"". (12) Introduction, second paragraph: ""high- and low-resolution"": Hyphenation is not warranted here. I would say ""at both high and low resolutions"". If you really like the hyphen, try something like ""in both high- and low-resolution regimes"". (13) Introduction, penultimate paragraph: ""there is no data that compares"" should be ""there are no data that compare"" (14) Evaluation of the ChemDock scoring function: ""and of these a correct pose"": Is correct pose different from correct conformation? The way the sentence is written suggests so, but I suspect not. Perhaps simplify the syntax to avoid confusion? (15) Analysis of specific examples. Last paragraph: If I understood correctly, the authors know this is not the correct solution because it doesn't match the high-resolution control structure. I guess the top panel of Fig 6D shows PDB 6T24. Did the authors consider adding a panel showing the ""correct"" conformation form the high-resolution PDB? (16) Discussion. First sentence. The need for automation is dominant perhaps only during fragment screening campaigns and the like. My view is that the accuracy (RMSD to ground truth) & quality (low strain) of the poses found by ChemEM are impressive, even without considering the automation. I would suggest ""accurately and automatically"". (17) ""our benchmark only cases better than 4.5Å"": ""only includes cases"" (word missing)? (18) M&M. Computational datasets. First sentence: ""Data to train the ChemDock scoring function was taken"" should be ""were taken"" (19) M&M. Computational datasets. First paragraph. Of the remaining 3,281 complexes, did any of them have close matches in the CASF-2016 dataset? For example, small molecule ligands bound to the same protein target, in the same pocket and with similar (but not identical) chemical structure to one in the CASF-2016 dataset? If so, then the training and test datasets may not be sufficiently independent. (20) Page 14. ""The data was split"" should be ""The data were split"" (21) Page 18.

I’d still like to add a few comments: a) In my opinion, your statement that “raccoon dogs are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2” (SC2) requires further limitations. It was never shown that SC2 strains that circulated at the Huanan seafood market can infect raccoon dogs. Barua et al (1) conclude that minks are only susceptible for SC2 variants that have the D614G or other enhancing mutations. The only study that ever showed that at least some raccoon dogs can be infected if 2ml of viral supernatant are inocculated intranasally (Freuling et al (2)) used a D614G SC variant. According to a personal conversation with Dr. Freuling, they were unaware of the relevance of D614G and no other virus was available at the time. As opposed to thousands of other animals, no infected wild raccoon dogs were ever found. b) Freuling et al detected approximately 10,000 fold lower maximal viral loads in raccoon dog nasal swaps as compared to viral loads in human nasal swaps (3). Thus, even in samples containing much less human than raccoon dog nucleic acids, the SC2 RNA is more likely to come from a human. c) As you mention, Liu et al state that human DNA was removed. As far as I know, commercially available kits do not differentiate between human and animal DNA. However, it is obvious that animal DNA in most cases could have come from blood (raccoon dogs were also butchered at some markets), while human DNA would likely have come from saliva (skin/hair particles are usually filtered out). DNA from blood is known to be much more stable as compared to DNA from other fluids (4), likely as it can be stabilized in coagulated particles. This could lead to a selective removal of human nucleic acids. d) Steve Massey found that sample Q61 contains significantly more reads from human common cold viruses than from SC2 (5). It is not plausible that those came from a raccoon dog. Maybe you would like to contact him and ask if he would like to publish this. e) Your Figure 4 nicely shows that for every species except for human there are some “high SC2/no resp. species” nucleic acid samples. This could be even be more informative than a correlation, as there were so many more humans that animals at the market, of which most were likely non-infected, and as human nucleic most certainly did not come from blood (comment c). f) It is could be interesting to figure out how old respective animal reads were by determining RNA/DNA ratios. I am no expert here, but this could be done by comparing coding strand/non-coding strand reads or exon/intron reads.

Here are some suggestions that I have: 1) The statistics in this paper should be represented differently, using a more consistent and coherent system. In addition, due to some of the data seeming to be non-normally distributed, a different statistical test should be used. A Friedman One Way Repeated Measure Analysis of Variance by Ranks may be a test to look into, as I believe this would allow for comparison between all groups while taking into account the distribution of the data. The statistical analysis should also be elaborated on more in the methods section. 2) The methods for administering the shear stress should be reconsidered, using more consistent controls. For example, the control (static condition) should incorporate the cone on top of the cells to control for any effects this may have on the cell phenotypes. The addition of medium to the cells may also impact the results. If possible, a different set up could be considered to more accurately reflect the in vivo conditions of blood flowing through the veins/arteries/heart since these are the biomedical applications discussed in the paper. For example, flowing fluid through a tube with cells to cause shear stress rather than spinning the fluid to cause shear stress.

The evidence for this notion is weak: the infection of olfactory receptor neurons is extremely rare (see, e.g., Butowt et al., 2021: https://link.springer.com/a.... The cells shown in your Fig. 3B are apparently not mitral cells located in the mitral cell layer, where label would be expected if the virus or virus proteins were transferred along the olfactory glomeruli. Other studies (e.g. Khan et al., 2021 in Cell: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go... have also described the location of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins as being outside the olfactory bulb parenchyma (“Consistent with the absence of evidence for infection of OSNs, we failed to find evidence for viral invasion of the OB parenchyma.“) I am surprised that you do not consider a more plausible explanation for the neuro-invasion that is evident on the ventromedial aspect of the olfactory bulb. The data you present are much more consistent with a transfer of SARS-CoV-2 along the nervus terminalis which has cell bodies scattered along the ventromedial aspect of the olfactory bulb – see, for example Wiechmann et al., 2018: ( https://www.researchgate.ne.... An uptake and transport of the virus or its proteins within the nervus terminalis is more likely than in the olfactory nerve, because the majority of the nervus terminalis neurons express ACE2, the virus entry protein – unlike the olfactory receptor neurons (Bilinska et al., 2021: https://www.frontiersin.org.... The presence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the hypothalamus of your hamsters also points to this route, since the nervus terminalis directly projects to this target. Recent studies support the idea that the nervus terminalis is a more plausible route of SARS-CoV-2 neuro-invasion than the olfactory nerve (Butowt and von Bartheld, 2022: https://molecularneurodegen.... I agree with your main conclusion, that neuro-invasion and anosmia occur independent from each other, but for the more simple reason: neuro-invasion likely follows the nervus terminalis, while anosmia is caused by elimination of the support cells in the olfactory epithelium (Butowt et al., Trends Neurosci 2023: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go....",2023-04-27T00:20:40,christophervonbartheld,Christopher von Bartheld,10.1101/2022.08.31.505985,Neuroinvasion and anosmia are independent phenomena upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 and its variants,"Guilherme Dias de Melo, Victoire Perraud, Flavio Alvarez, Alba Vieites-Prado, Seonhee Kim, Lauriane Kergoat, Anthony Coleon, Bettina Salome Trüeb, Magali Tichit, Aurèle Piazza, Agnès Thierry, David Hardy, Nicolas Wolff, Sandie Munier, Romain Koszul, Etienne Simon-Lorière, Volker Thiel, Marc Lecuit, Pierre-Marie Lledo, Nicolas Renier, Florence Larrous, Hervé Bourhy",2023-04-19

Most diseases involve the connection of numerous coordinated host systems. While it is known that numerous host systems, including the nervous systems, are involved with distal disease sites, research has been limited to investigate single organs. In the present manuscript, the researchers sought to develop an imaging method (wildDISCO) in whole mice bodies to visualize the distribution and association of cell types within hosts. Using wildDISCO, researchers were able to develop a method to investigate through microscopy the nervous, immune, and lymphatic systems. In addition to validating the methodology, the researchers demonstrated the nerve connections between different organs, a previous limitation to whole-organ microscopy. Additionally, they demonstrate that there is co-localization of immune cells with vagus and sympathetic nerves in the inferior mesenteric plexus and intestinal wall, respectively. Finally, using germ-free mice, the study determined the nerve lattice structure is less dense compared to mice harboring a gut microbiota, highlighting the importance of the gut microbiota in the development of the mesenteric plexus. Therefore, wildDISCO is a useful technology that can not only be used for physiological research, but also fully understand the cellular dynamics within whole mice during various diseases. Positive feedback. The present study addresses a long standing limitation to the field of whole-organ microscopy, allowing researchers to now address organ connectivity of various systems. As such, the manuscript was well organized and the microscopy was clear in demonstrating the various principles investigated. Specifically, the microscopy for PGP9.5 and LYVE1 truly demonstrates the distribution and connectivity of nerves within whole mice, a tremendous feature not previously investigated before. In addition to the physiological questions addressed in the manuscript, the in vivo experiment demonstrating the influence of the gut microbiota in the development of the sympathetic nervous system was particularly exciting. The results present in the manuscript provide crucial insights into the interconnection of host systems within mice and allow other researchers to begin to address these insights. Major Concerns The graphical abstract needs to be more clarified for where cholesterol depletion is occurring within these mice Throughout the manuscript, analysis of the results is often missing. If the authors could include their interpretation of the results at the end of each figure, it would help readers understand. Figure 1C - The methylene blue staining of mouse brains should be quantified. The present microscopy is difficult to see on paper and staining looks similar across treatment groups. Figure 4A - the authors state there is substantial co-localization of immune cells with vagus nerves and sympathetic nerves, could this be quantified by the authors? Perhaps the percentage of CD45+ signal which localize to the nerves? The results section for figure 5 is missing from the manuscript. This should be added to the manuscript. Minor concerns The gut-brain axis has been investigated heavily. In the germ free mice, were there changes in the development of nerves in the brains? If the authors could talk more about this technology in the discussion section and how this could be applicable to other physiological systems or diseases, I think that would help the manuscript.

The abstract provides a clear background on the antibody-dependent enhancement issue in DENV pathogenesis and its impact on vaccine development. The objectives of the study are also well-defined. However, I recommend adding a brief explanation of saturation mutagenesis and directed evolution for readers who may not be familiar with these techniques. It is interesting to note the development of the D2-FL and D2-FLM variants that evade both pre-membrane and fusion-loop antibodies. I suggest providing more information on the functional analysis and characterization of these engineered variants, including any potential impact on viral fitness, replication, or virulence. The observation of lower neutralization titers against D2-FL and D2-FLM in heterotypic serum compared to isogenic wildtype DENV2 is an important finding. However, it would be helpful to include some quantitative data or statistical analysis to support this observation. In the conclusion, you propose the use of D2-FL and D2-FLM as tools for delineating cross-reactive antibody subtypes and as a platform for safer live attenuated DENV vaccines. While this is a promising application, it would be valuable to discuss any preliminary data or experiments that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these engineered viruses in vivo.

In particular, it was nice to see how these approaches provide results that largely match with the gene balance model and other ideas about how polyploids might evolve, and we liked that comparison to results in mammals suggests the uniformity of these processes across the tree of life. Nonetheless, our discussion led to several suggestions that we hope might help improve the manuscript. We stress, however, that we recognize the authors have thought about these ideas much longer than we have, and that some of our comments may stem from our own misunderstanding of the work. In the manuscript the authors recognize that comparison to null networks is important for distinguishing intriguing features of real networks. The authors generate a good null expectation for motifs in a GRN by modeling random degree-preserving unscaled networks and counting motifs. We wondered, however, whether random unduplicated networks are the appropriate null. Simple duplication of all the nodes in a network, where each node maintains its links, will create a network with bilateral symmetry. This symmetry will give rise to symmetrical motifs – for example two nodes connected by a directed link will generate a bifan motif when duplicated. Over time, or after random perturbations to the links and nodes in the network, this bifan could be degraded to form triangular motifs like the V and lambda motifs. Because duplication creates new motifs, the expected number of motifs should be much higher in a duplicated GRN created by whole genome duplication. A symmetrical null model should capture this higher motif frequency. Testing hypotheses with a revised null model could yield exciting results and address additional questions: . Is the observation of motif enrichment an inevitable consequence of network duplication? Is the search for motifs with bilateral symmetry why patterns in Solanum – the result of a triplication – are an exception to the observed patterns? A fair bit of the discussion focuses on the timing of polyploidy. Here we felt it would help readers to introduce them earlier to the ages of the different polyploidy events studied. We also felt the authors could do more to distinguish between the age and number of polyploidy events – in their examples, species with “newer” polyploidy events were also those with the largest number of total events, for example. And even the newest events are many millions of years old – is a 5myo polyploidy event expected to be much different from a 15 or 30myo event? Throughout, we felt there were places where explicit hypotheses would help the reader. What are the predictions made by different models of duplication and evolution? Do we expect these to differ qualitatively or quantitatively between GRNs and PPI? Do we have predictions about which GO terms might be significant and why? (e.g. why should stress genes hang around longer?). Laying these out would especially be helpful for biologists less familiar with networks and the gene balance hypothesis and their comparisons. The authors compare duplicates from WGD to those from SSD, but neither group is homogeneous. Whole genome duplications may be the result of allopolyploidy or autopolyploidy, which could impact the detection of different motifs. It would be useful for the authors to discuss the implications of the type of ancestral WGD event and how it could bias their detection of motifs and subsequent findings. Additionally, the software developed by the authors’ research group, `doubletrouble`, appears to separate SSDs into 4 categories (tandem, proximal, transposed, and dispersed duplications). Would we expect patterns for the various types of SSDs to differ? Is the variation depicted in Figure 2 for the SSD-derived gene pairs a result of variation between SSD classes or other types of noise? Finally, we wondered how large-scale duplications of multiple genes or even aneuploidy might lead to different results, especially if there is any clustering of genes by function.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.06.535924v1#comment-6167282460,biorxivstage,3,"The manuscript entitled: “Layer Dependence of Monocular and Binocular Responses in Human Ocular Dominance Columns at 7T using VASO and BOLD” is an exciting manuscript describing a high-resolution VASO study to measure laminar and columnar signal variations in V1. This study uses an extraordinary experimental setup with some most advanced imaging hardware and some of the most advanced sequences, and custom built stimulation equipment. It touches on some of the most important issues of the field of high-resolution imaging, including. Finding a good compromise of sensitivity and specificity, Multimodal sequences (VASO and BOLD) and how to combine signals across them. Using NORDIC noise cleaning, which is a hot topic in the field and many researchers are looking at how this develops. Simultaneous columnar and laminar imaging. In my understanding this is a methods-focused study that investigates these topics in the ‘testbed’ of ocular dominance columns. I believe this is an appropriate model, as it has been previously established for such purposes:  E.g. Kemper et al. (2018, see Fig. 2 for simultaneous columnar and laminar features) and Feinberg et al. (2018, see Fig. 7-8 for ODC across depth). And also see (Hollander et al., 2021) (Zaretskaya 2020) (Qian 2023) (Haenelt 2020). Simultaneous columnar and laminar analyses aside of ODC are more sparse:  E.g. De Martino et al. (2015) in the auditory cortex, Huber et al (2020) in the sensorimotor system, and  Schneider et al. (2019) in V5/MT+. I see many strengths of the paper: -> The study uses advanced experimental setups. -> There is a nice inherent reproducibility happening in this study. Each result is reproduced for left and right eyes/columns, respectively. -> The authors succeed in transparently describing the data in a relatively raw form. E.g. showing voxel-wise activation maps, showing single contrast responses (not only differential responses). This helps the reader to appreciate the raw data quality. Unfortunately, in recent years it has become too common to solely show high level end results as abstract line plots. This paper does not have such shortcomings. However, this might mean that some readers might wonder why voxels were not selected as contrast responses ( e.g. left vs. right). I think there is one minor point of potential confusion. I have talked to two colleagues about what they think about the preprint and both brought this up. If the authors agree, they could clarify the potential danger of double-dipping (or lack thereof): The authors select voxels based on the response to a given eye. Then they use these voxels to test if the response to the same eye is stronger than to another eye. This might be perceived as circular. Thus even in random noise, those voxels will have a non-zero mean bias, based on their selection criteria. I think there are many steps and controls that the authors do that mitigate the danger of double dipping: -> The voxels are selected on a single contrast, while the subsequent conclusion about the contrast difference. But even doing so, there might still be a stronger bias in one condition than the other condition. -> BOLD results speak against the danger of double dipping. The voxels that are selected for left eye responses end up showing even stronger responses for the right eye (Fig. 4B). If there would be a danger of double-dipping the result would be the other way around. Or maybe with a different voxel selection, the right-eye dominance in this plot would be even stronger. -> The authors also analyze the BOLD data in the voxels that have been selected from the VASO signal. And they reproduce the result that the eye-selectivity is stronger in VASO than BOLD. Though, there might be a residual noise coupling between VASO and BOLD via the BOLD correction procedure. The authors could consider discussing the danger of double dipping. If their data size allows, they should perform the voxel selection and the contrast testing on independent parts of the dataset. Typos and stylistic comments: -> The TR is given as the inversion-recovery TR of 3294ms. Technically this is referring to the time of acquiring two volumes plus inversion delay. This number refers to the effective temporal resolution but does not refer to the COBIDAS definition of a TR, which would be the acquisition of each volume (e.g. like the TR definition in ASL sequences). Maybe it would be clearer to call it TR_pair or something like this? -> It would be great to mention the matrix size (or FOV). This way the reader can appreciate the advanced protocol of 0.7mm resolution. -> It would be great to mention the phase encoding direction. I suspect that the head gradient allows read directions in A>>P direction, which is usually prohibited by PNS for body gradients. -> It would be informative to mention the NORDIC version (e.g. github release number). There have been some differences and improvements for later versions. -> The application of layer-specific smoothing can be reasonable. Especially, if the SNR of non-BOLD contrasts at 0.7mm is otherwise too low to see anything. But it might still appear strange to some naive readers without any justification. Maybe the authors can include a sentence or two giving slightly more background. E.g. stating that this moothing should not affect the direction differential modulations (only reduce the effect size a bit, maybe). Or stating that this is necessary due to the unconventionally small voxel sizes? -> It’s a matter of style who to cite and not to cite and it does not change the results nor the credibility of the conclusions. The authors could consider including more references of previous studies that did simultaneous laminar and columnar OCD fMRI in humans (e.g. listed above). -> “Martino” should be “De Martino” -> GREASE should be GRASE. -> The end of 2.4.1 states that a binary mask was used to confine the voxels. It might help the reproducibility to add a little more detail. Was this a GM ROI? Was this an anatomically defined V1 mask? -> The manuscript states that the columns are shown on Fig. 3. This figure shows surface maps. So, it is not clear how consistent the pattern is across cortical depths and the pattern really refers to columnar structures. Maybe the authors can include a brief statement that is shown in Fig. 3. Is this the signal averaged across cortical depth? Is it referring to the signal in the middle layer? -> In the field of layer-fMRI there are many common procedures on how the signal pooling is done which leads to different results ( https://twitter.com/layerfM.... I think each approach is justifiable. Here it is done on a voxel-specific level. This means that BOLD and VASO might have different numbers of voxels across depths. I do not think that this is a concern here because the authors look at both contrasts in either set of voxels. But it might help the reader if it’s explicitly mentioned whether the numbers of voxels per layer are substantially different. -> WM voxels in Fig. 2B. It might appear weird to inexperienced readers why VASO has so much ‘activity’ in white matter. Since the activation threshold is at 0, this is not concerning. Even for random noise, half of WM should be visible as ‘active’. Given that the GRADSMOOTH is isotropic in WM and linearly-oriented in GM the effective smoothing is different across tissue types. Maybe it would make sense to include a short explanation on how to interpret the WM voxels? -> Some readers might be spoiled by overly beautiful and clear tiny parallel stripes that hit the V1/V2 border in a perpendicular direction (e.g. Nasr 2016). This is not so clearly visible here. Maybe it’s worth considering to justify this. e.g.  highlight that the resolution here is substantially higher and that the sequence is non-BOLD. Unlike previous studies, this allows vein free interpretation of depth profiles. This is a different goal than obtaining the most beautiful vein-enhanced surface maps. -> The introduction states “veins blur both the laminar and columnar BOLD responses”. The word “blur” could be specified. E.g. “distort” or “misplace” would be good alternatives. I hope to see this manuscript published in a highly respected journal. _________________ The above letter is a summary of a zoom call between Federico De Martino and Renzo Huber.

We acknowledge that there can be advantages to pseudobulk methods, and that no single method is likely to outperform all others in all settings. As the technologies and methods used in our paper are now over four years old, in a rapidly moving field, we expect many newer analyses will be able to clearly outperform previous papers in the field, including ours. More broadly, we encourage students and practitioners to revisit previous papers as a general practice of open science, and to share the results in open, respectful, and transparent ways, which can move the field forward collaboratively and constructively. That said, in this particular case, Murphy et al.'s results fall short of their claims, and they fail to demonstrate any advantages of their approach compared to our manuscript, due to several technical and logical mistakes in their analysis, which we outline here: http://compbio.mit.edu/scAD... Briefly: * Murphy et al. do not compare to our actual 1,031 reported differentially expressed genes (DEGs), they exclude our mixed-model results from their comparison, thus misinterpreting our work as cell-level-only with 14,274 DEGs, which is a misrepresentation of our results. * They interpret any differences between their results and ours as improvements (conflating false positives with true predictions and lack of power with specificity) without providing any independent support – by contrast, our paper validated our DEGs using both targeted experiments and comparison with previous human and animal studies. * Their central claim that our reported DEGs are false positives lacks any substance: indeed, they are not found by their pseudobulk method, but they could simply be missed due to lack of power, and Murphy et al. provide no independent evidence that their method is sensitive or accurate. * Conversely, the 16 DEGs that they do report lack any independent evidence that they are biologically meaningful, and Murphy et al. provide no evidence that their method is specific. In fact, their 16 DEGs show unrealistically-high ~1200% median changes, and only implicate the rarest cell types, suggesting they may represent false positives stemming from unaddressed statistical artifacts due to outliers and small cell counts. * Murphy et al. also make general claims about the advantages of pseudobulk methods by applying only one method, erroneously, to only one dataset, without any benchmarks, and without comparison to current state-of-the-art methods, while misusing statistical terminology. * Lastly, they overstate their previous results from a similar Matters Arising commentary, which also advocated for pseudobulk using the same pattern of only analyzing a single dataset, methodological shortcomings, overstated conclusions, and not addressing corrections suggested by the original authors. This is a helpful example to discuss potential pitfalls in comparing bioinformatic pipelines, and to recommend perhaps more constructive strategies for such comparisons, including: applying candidate methods to more than one dataset, comparing to the actual results of the original paper without misrepresenting them, using independent validation metrics to evaluate differences instead of assuming that they are all improvements, using well-established and rigorous benchmarks, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methodologies, scrutinizing their own predictions for potential confounders, and seeking to understand the biological or technical drivers of potential differences.

The paper ameliorates apparent discrepancies between previously published in vivo and in vitro results, where N. gonorrhoeae expressing opaD are isolated from host neutrophil-rich secretions, but are killed when infecting neutrophils in vitro. The current study establishes a novel, complement-independent, protective role for C4BP against neutrophil activity. Thus, the work clarifies a major paradox in the field. The manuscript was a pleasure to read. It is logically laid out and clearly presented. The conclusions are well supported by the data. We have only minor suggestions to help improve some aspects of clarity: Minor Comments 1. On line 34, the authors state that there are 98 million cases annually of gonorrhea world-wide while on line 47 they state that there are 86.9 million cases. If the numbers refer to different things, the authors should describe the distinction. 2. Figure 1A and 1B both include data showing the proportion of surviving cells with 25% serum at 60 minutes, but those percentages are rather different: ~70% in Figure 1A and ~30% in Figure 1B. Is this variability due to differences in serum used or does it simply reflect variability in the measurement? 3. In Figure 2A, the authors test the ability of serum from different animal species to inhibit ROS production. Chimpanzees have been used to model gonorrhea infection, so it would be interesting to see how chimpanzee serum compares to human serum in this experiment. 4. Figure 5F is slightly confusing. Are the authors suggesting that if a bacterium is associated with a neutrophil, it will be taken up no matter what? A more detailed description of the experiment in the text would help clarify this. 5. Is C4BP known for being able to survive heat-inactivation without being denatured? If so, the authors should state this. 6. The rationale for using salt fractionation could be explained more clearly. 7. C4BP and OpaD play a major role when neutrophils are present. Can the authors speculate on how these proteins fit into the full pathogenic cycle? For example, where do they place among other processes that prevent killing by neutrophils?",2023-04-20T13:58:02,disqus_y9FR6hyg5J,Joseph Wade,10.1101/2022.12.08.519701,Neisseria gonorrhoeae co-opts C4b-binding protein to enhance complement-independent survival from neutrophils,"Lacie M.

Was there a mistake in uploading the data? Also, I noticed that in Supp Table 2, all the entries are 0. Was this also a mistake? Thank you! Looking forward to being able to access the actual cell type labels!

As we have extensively documented and published, antigen retention during sequential staining process is as crucial as an efficient antibody stripping ( doi:10.1369/0022155417719419 ). Having shown that boiling in retrieval buffer, 6M Urea and a pH 2 glycine buffer do not remove all bound antibodies ( doi:10.1369/0022155414536732 ), we published that both bound antibody and tissue antigen conformation needs to be preserved over cycling: disaccharides provide such protection ( doi:10.1369/0022155415616162 ). Antibodies survive >30 cycles of staining and stripping with the MILAN protocol ( https://doi.org/10.21203/rs...) and only 3 out of 314 are selectively inactivated by the 2ME/SDS buffer. Thus the relatively high number of antibodies who fail to stain later in the cycles after antigen retrieval has no other explanation than antigen re-masking. The key problem NM Claudio and colleagues face is that the ethanol step required to remove the chromogen will probably denature and precipitate in-situ bound antibodies, making them available to detection in the next step, as they document. Disaccharides are insoluble in ethanol, therefore tertiary structure protection is at risk during this step. We suggest to use the MILAN protocol to strip bound antibodies before the chromogen inactivation step.",2023-04-16T08:12:08,giorgio_cattoretti,Giorgio Cattoretti,10.1101/2023.04.13.536793,Sequential chromogenic immunohistochemistry: spatial analysis of lymph nodes identifies contact interactions between plasmacytoid dendritic cells and plasmablasts,"N.M.
