Nevertheless, the results presented appear to describe rare, stress-induced physiological edge cases rather than a widespread or ecologically dominant behavior. The very low frequency of successful blood acquisition from intact vertebrate hosts, together with the highly artificial dehydration conditions required to elicit this behavior, suggest that the epidemiological relevance of male blood-feeding under natural conditions remains uncertain. These findings are best interpreted as an expansion of the known physiological limits of male mosquitoes, rather than as evidence warranting a fundamental revision of established knowledge in medical entomology.",2026-01-16T14:18:58,rengatoarmas,René Gato Armas,10.1101/2024.10.08.617226,Revisiting the paradigm of anhematophagy in male mosquitoes,"Jovana Bozic, Renuka E.

Technical Note regarding the history and capability of flow cytometric sorting of plant protoplasts. We read with interest the description of the PIVOT platform and its application to high-throughput functional genetics in Nicotiana benthamiana. The use of viral superinfection exclusion to ensure single multiplicity of infection (MOI) per cell is an elegant and clever approach to pooled library delivery. However, we would like to offer a technical correction regarding the stated incompatibility of Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) with N. benthamiana protoplasts. The manuscript suggests that current FACS instruments are not compatible with fragile protoplasts sizing 20-100 µm in diameter. On the contrary, the plant flow cytometry community has successfully utilized large-bore, low-pressure flow sorting for these exact cell types for over forty years. Historically, specialized configurations—including the use of large flow tips (up to 200 µm) and reduced sheath pressure—have allowed for the high-purity sorting of intact, viable protoplasts ranging from 40 to nearly 100 µm. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that Nicotiana protoplasts sorted via FACS remain totipotent and can be regenerated into fertile, whole plants, demonstrating that the shear forces of a correctly configured sorter are not inherently lethal to these wall-less cells. While Magnetic-Activated Protoplast Sorting (MAPS) provides a valuable biochemical alternative for labs without access to specialized large-particle sorters, we believe the manuscript would benefit from a more accurate characterization of flow cytometry's historical and current capabilities in plant biology.

The demonstration that lipid exchange precedes or accompanies substrate transfer in both Dot/Icm (Legionella pneumophila) and RK2 (Escherichia coli) systems is particularly elegant and mechanistically informative. However, the concept that host contact itself acts as the primary trigger for secretion system activation is not unprecedented and was demonstrated more than 25 years ago for Type III secretion systems (T3SSs). In a seminal study, Brito et al. (1999) showed that expression of hrp genes in the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum is specifically induced upon direct bacterium–plant cell contact, independently of secretion activity itself. This contact-dependent induction requires the outer membrane protein PrhA, which functions as a bacterial receptor sensing a non-diffusible signal from the plant cell wall, thereby activating virulence gene transcription (EMBO Journal, 1999). Together, these studies suggest that contact-dependent sensing of host surfaces is a conserved and ancient principle governing the activation of bacterial secretion systems, albeit implemented through distinct molecular mechanisms (transcriptional induction in T3SSs versus lipid-mediated priming in T4SSs). Explicitly acknowledging this conceptual continuity would strengthen the broader biological context of the present work and highlight how it extends a long-standing paradigm from transcriptional regulation to biophysical membrane-level priming.

However, those were later shown to arise from an analytical confound; when corrected, Bayesian analyses favor the null hypothesis, indicating no association between uninstructed respiratory phase and RP amplitude (Jeay-Bizot et al. preprint https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/b5ka2_v1). In light of these results, we are left with the question of how there can be causation without correlation. In the absence of covariation, it is unclear how respiratory phase could exert a direct causal influence on the amplitude of the RP. The authors need to clarify how a causal relationship can exist without a corresponding correlation. This is essential for supporting the interpretation advanced in this preprint.",2026-01-14T22:42:50,,Lucas Jeay-Bizot,10.1101/2025.07.27.666697,The respiratory phase causally modulates the readiness potential amplitude,"Samuel J.

This is clearly indicative of over-fitting and inaccurate application of cross-validation. Regardless of the actual correlation of gut microbiome composition with disease, it is scientifically implausible that it could accurately predict ""heart failure"" and ""schizophrenia"" with >99% accuracy as depicted here. It is also worth noting that in Figure 3C on ""external validation"" the model does not particularly outperform a simple random forest on any of the examples. The abstract states ""Furthermore, its attention patterns reveal biologically plausible microbial signatures"", but this is clearly not correct from a cursory reading of Figure 4. The top feature in predicting ""Healthy vs Disease"" is V. cholerae, but that is simply because one of the studies included in this analysis was on patients selected because they were known to be infected with V. cholerae. This is a particularly good example of why simply predicting ""healthy vs disease"" across unrelated and disparate studies is not a particularly scientifically meaningful exercise. Further, the other top features across studies are Staphylococcus epidermis, a skin microbe that only residues transiently in the gut microbiome. This is a decent indicator of contamination, and it is therefore likely that this feature is  because the model is overfitting on signals of contamination endemic to particular studies. Staphylococcus is unlikely to be involved in a causal role in any of these diseases.

The integration of GRN priors with Mamba blocks presents a promising approach. However, we are unable to reproduce the fine-tuning process or utilize RegFormer as a foundation model due to two critical missing components in the provided GitHub repository: 1. The Vocabulary File: The code calls for default_gene_vocab.json, which is essential for aligning gene token IDs with the pretrained model. Generating a new vocabulary from HGNC (as suggested by the helper functions) creates a mismatch with the pretrained embedding dimensions. 2. Pretrained Model Checkpoints: While the paper mentions pretraining on 26 million cells, the pretrained weights (checkpoint files) are not available in the repository or linked in the ""Data Availability"" section. Several users have raised similar concerns in the GitHub Issues section without a response. Could you please provide a link (e.g., via Stomics Cloud or Zenodo) to these essential files?

But apologies if I missed this in the pre-print, but have you evaluated what happens if there is not a perfect 1:1 matching of cell types in the spatial and single cell reference? For example, what happens if there is a cell type in the single cell data that is not in the spatial transcriptomics data. Will the expression data be over-corrected and create a cluster of cells not really there? And also, what happens if there are cell types (e.g. neutrophils) in the spatial transcriptomics data that is not in the single cell reference? Will the adjusted expression valuesn hide cell types only in the spatial data but not in the RNAseq? Thank you for making a great tool.

All the questions you raised are actually very logical. I would like to note that working on local translation and with molecular components localized to neurites or axons is not trivial, as the amount of material we deal with is quite minute (especially in the case of CNS neurons). Thus, we have to deal with quite a variability in some cases. I invite you to read the final version of the manuscript (doi: 10.1002/jev2.70216). It will probably not directly adress your concerns at this point but we can still use this platform for discussion. We we will be happy to respond your questions.

However, I think the claim already implicit  in the title suggesting that the mice GABAergic cells surrounding the Pbg represents Imc neurons of birds is unfounded. To begin with, Imc neurons are strongly motion selective, as are the entire  isthmic circuit and tectofugal system of birds, and do not respond to static gratings. In fact, a missing aspect of this very complete study is to record from the PLTI's neurons and see if they have some selectivity to the orientation of the gratings used  in the behavioral paradigm. In this respect, why using gratings in the behavioral tests and looming stimulation in the electrophysiological recording experiments in in intermediate layers of the SC?. The avian isthmotectal system, composed by the Ipc, Imc and SLu nuclei,  is an incredible mechanism that seems to mediate stimulus competition, perhaps spatial attention, and it is very tempting to look for a similar system in mammals. However, there are substantial anatomical and physiological differences between the Ipc and Pbg to assume that they are homolog or play a similar function, and the same applies for the Imc and the PLTi. It seems this study found an important component of a neural mechanism mediating stimulus competition in mice, but my guess is that it is entirely different to the avian one.",2026-01-08T20:18:20,,Gonzalo Marin,10.1101/2022.06.27.497794,Ancient brainstem inhibitory neurons control selective spatial attention,"Ninad B.

One related piece of work seems missing from the discussion/citations: Ibrahim et al. (2023). That paper uses AF2-multimer specifically to identify functional short linear motifs (AIM/LIR) that mediate ATG8/LC3 interactions, including noncanonical motifs and pathogen/virus-encoded virulence factors targeting host autophagy, and it combines modeling with phylogenetic analysis and binding/functional assays. Given the conclusion that linear-motif mimicry is frequent, a discussion of Ibrahim et al. would help place the findings in the context of prior AF2-multimer-enabled SLiM discovery—while also clarifying what’s novel here (scale across thousands of host–pathogen PPIs and comparative interface/mimicry analysis versus a focused, mechanism-driven motif family).

Consistent with this observation, the average match rate in Native Americans (and Oceanians) for segments of at least 0.1cM does not stand out from that of other populations (Fig. S104). It is likely that the results for Native Americans are confounded by greater genetic drift between the allele frequencies of Native Americans and those of Africans used as reference for distinguishing archaic and modern human ancestry."" So basically the research team apriori assumes that Amerindians are recent and hence label Amerindians' excessive matches to a 200,000 year old Denisovan sequence as ""false positives"". This does not take into account the hypothesis that modern humans originated from an East Asian hominin, speciated in the New World into anatomically and behaviorally modern humans and expanded out of America as a single wave into the Old World where they admixed with later Denisovans (in Oceania and Asia), Neandertals in Asia and Europe and with archaic Africans in Africa.

In Valentino et al. 2022 ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35288123/) the authors mathematically predict that Drosophila germ granule proteins have a functional role in mediating mRNA localization and germ granule composition of nos and pgc. By adding several new theoretical germ granule behaviors to the mathematical model, the authors conclude “that the germ granule protein ensemble has a significant influence on germ granule mRNA composition [mRNA localization], which is consistent with studies showing the importance of protein-based condensation mechanisms in the assembly of RNA-rich P granules in C. elegans (Folkmann, et al. 2021and Schmidt et al. 2021)."" For example, one parameter includes a soft cap for germ granule mRNA carrying capacity that represents Osk’s biophysical ability to fluctuate between granules, first identified in Trcek et al. 2020. “The soft cap allows for granules to recruit and contain mRNA clusters that are larger than their carrying capacity.” By incorporating a soft cap that can recapitulate biological data, their results support “the presence of support proteins within the granule that can stabilize [mRNA] clusters.” Given the mathematical predictions of the existence of functional roles for non-Osk germ granule proteins in mRNA localization from Valentino et al. 2022, it would be helpful to the field and exciting to read about a more detailed introduction and discussion connecting the experimental results of this study to the mathematical modeling results from previous Drosophila germ granule research.",2026-01-02T02:01:42,,Matthew Niepielko,10.64898/2025.12.19.695503,Conserved RNA helicase Vasa regulates ribonucleoprotein condensates through protein interaction and mRNA recruitment,"Siran Tian, Hyosik Kim, Harrison A.

We discussed it in my lab recently and have a suggestion for the authors. Briefly, we are concerned that the claim that GBP1 is a negative regulator of biological nitrogen fixation may be affected by the normalization approach used for nitrogenease activity (ARA). In this manuscript, as far as I understand, the ARA data were normalized with the nodule weight.  The authors show that the number of nodule per plant is not affected by the gbp1 mutations, but the images of nodules provided suggest that gbp1 nodules are slightly smaller than wild-type nodules. If the nodule weight is smaller in gbp1 mutants than in wild-type plants, the normalized ARA activity may appear larger in the gbp1 mutants than in wild-type plants. We suggest that the authors add data on nodule weight in gbp1 mutants and wild-type plants, and present ARA data normalized per nodule or per plant, in addition to the data already shown. They probably already have this data, and it could strengthen their manuscript. I hope that this will help a bit!

Consistently, telocytes mediate rhythmic electrical activity in other tissues (65), which is believed to depend on ion channels for generating pacemaking currents (66, 67). Interestingly, electrically coupled cells are typically connected by gap junctions (63), and evidence demonstrating this physical link between telocytes and LMCs does not exist (6).

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.13.688363v1#comment-6812559413,biorxivstage,1,"This manuscript documents careful genetic analysis to better understand where and how Rho signaling acts in the C. elegans egg laying circuit. The authors demonstrate that Rho functions in mature neurons to promote egg laying, as well as in vulval muscle. By using calcium imaging, the authors were able to demonstrate how Rho signaling (specifically in the HSN neurons) regulates cell excitability presynaptically (HSN) and postsynaptically (vulval muscles). We found the experiments to be well designed and the data to be robust, with the major conclusions to be supported by the data. Minor comments: 1)	The introduction included a detailed analysis of the Gq signaling pathway and the candidate targets that regulate neuronal activity (i.e. DAG-regulated effectors and ion channels), but the scope of the paper does not include testing or identifying the targets downstream of TrioRhoGEF/Rho. On the other hand, the focus of this manuscript is neurotransmission in the egg laying circuit, and little detail is provided about how and what neurotransmitters are released by HSN. Only in the results section is NLP-3 mentioned, but it is known that both serotonin and NLP-3 released from HSN each contribute significantly to egg laying. 2)	The authors conclude that Rho promotes synaptic transmission, and this is on the whole correct, but the authors could be more careful/precise with their wording and interpretations. As noted in comment 1, both serotonin and NLP-3 contribute to synaptic transmission in the egg laying circuit, but it is not known how directly these two components act in synaptic transmission. For example, NLP-3 is a neuropeptide that is released from dense core vesicles (DCVs), and it is possible that serotonin is also incorporated into DCVs as well as synaptic vesicles. In addition, serotonin and NLP-3 are known to act extrasynaptically as well as synaptically, and it is possible that Rho contributes to extrasynaptic release of serotonin and NLP-3. 3)	When analyzing their data, the authors bin calcium imaging measurements in the active vs inactive state. The active and inactive egg laying states are characteristic for wildtype worms, but as the authors show, altering the activity of the HSN affects egg laying. Another interpretation of their data is that when Rho is activated (HSN::Rho-1(G14V)) the worm is always in the active egg laying state, and when Rho is inhibited (HSN C3 Transferase) the worm never enters the active egg laying state. While we don’t think they need to change how they analyze the data, the authors could just add this interpretation to the discussion. 4)	We feel like the authors should include a more detailed discussion of why they see a difference in the effect of expressing dominant negative Rho (T19N) vs the C3 transferase in HSN. Why did Rho-1(T19N) expressed in HSN not show such a clear inhibition of calcium activity and egg laying as the C3 transferase expressed in HSN? 5)	In general, gain-of-function experiments are hard to interpret. Activated Rho could increase cell excitability, but that does not necessarily mean that is the function of Rho normally. The loss-of-function experiments are more convincing, aside from the discrepancy we noted in comment 4. This could be noted in the discussion. 6)	Lines 148 & 179: provide more detail or a reference for how extrachromosomal arrays were integrated. 7)	Lines 195 & 214: it is unclear how GCaMP arrays were confirmed by mCherry fluorescence (nlp-3p::mCherry) given that these strains also have arrays carrying tph-1p::mCherry and both nlp-3p::mCherry and tph-1p::mCherry should express in the HSNs. 8)	Line 339: the authors conclude that Rho acts “downstream of Trio RhoGEF.” However, the data show that a Trio mutant is only partially bypassed by expression of activated Rho – i.e. # of eggs is intermediate between the Trio mutant alone and activated Rho alone. These data are consistent with Rho acting downstream of Trio, but with RhoGEF activity still contributing to full activation of the “activated” Rho(G14V). The data would also be consistent with Trio and Rho acting at least partially in parallel, which could occur within the same cell or in different cells. A further complication to the interpretation of these data is that different activated Rho arrays are used in the WT and Trio mutant backgrounds. These different arrays could have different expression levels, which is a big caveat to making these comparisons. Ideally, one would use the same array in the WT and Trio mutant backgrounds. 9)	p. 16, lines 348-459: many of the Fig 2 callouts on this page refer to the wrong panel. 10)	Line 347: says 70%, but the data in the figure show >80%. 11)	Line 348: says 3 +/- 1 eggs, but Fig 2B says 3 +/- 0.2 eggs for same strain. 12)	Line 363: we were confused by this. Are the authors suggesting that you can’t quantitatively compare the effects of the HSN vs. muscle specific expression of activated Rho(G14V) because the arrays are mosaic? While it is true that the arrays may be mosaic, they also carry an mCherry marker expressed in the same cells, so they should know whether the array is expressing activated Rho as intended in the worms assayed, and it is unclear why mosaicism is an issue. A bigger issue to quantitatively comparing these strains is that they probably have different expression levels of activated Rho. 13)	Line 396: “outside of egg-laying active states (Figure 3A).” However, the data in Fig 3A shows HSN activity “during an egg-laying active state” according to the figure legend. Data showing activity outside egg-laying active states are not shown, but should be presented. 14)	Line 423: it is unclear how “instantaneous” transient frequency is defined. This should be added to the methods or figure legend. 15)	Line 428: says “more than 5 transients per minute” but the data in Fig 3C show it to be just under 4 transients per minute. 16)	Line 561-562. “This difference largely resulted from a lack of twitch transients around egg-laying events in C3T-expressing animals.” This argument doesn’t make sense to us. How could a lack of twitch transients affect the amplitude of the transients that are seen? 17)	Line 648: “we do not see dramatic effects on HSN morphology and presynaptic structure upon Rho inactivation.” Presynaptic structure was not assayed, so this should be cut.
