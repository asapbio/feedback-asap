https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.05.459025v1#comment-5529147342,biorxivstage,0,"I have some concerns, both major and minor, about this manuscript. I will deal with the minor concerns first. The manuscript is not easy to read – it is not reader friendly. The text deals with a large number of sequences, derived from the authors own work and obtained from the databases. These are all referred to by their database accession numbers. So, for example, when the text refers to the virus phylogenetic tree saying “MYVMV tree (Figure 1b) produced two major branches. All the MYVMV isolates from Pakistan were clustered into clade I under branch A while the Indian isolates were grouped into both the branches.” the figure does not show this – it is just a collection of anonymous database accession numbers. To confirm what the authors claim the tree shows, the reader would need to refer to a supplementary table or the database. Things could be so much better. The manuscript quotes Brown et al. (2012) which first suggested the use of “isolate descriptors” with up-dates in Brown, J.K., Zerbini, F.M., Navas-Castillo, J., Moriones, E., Ramos-Sobrinho, R., Silva, J.F., Fiallo-Olivé, E., Briddon, R.W., Hernández-Zepeda, C., Idris, A., Malathi, V.G., Martin, D.P., Rivera-Bustamante, R., Ueda, S., Varsani, A., 2015. Revision of Begomovirus taxonomy based on pairwise sequence comparisons. Arch. Virol. 160(6), 1593-1619. So at each mention of sequence EF373060, for example, you would put “MeYVMV-Ben[IN:Bar:06](EF373060)”. This gives the reader all the information needed to know what the sequence is – so, in this case, species Mesta yellow vein mosaic virus; strain Bengal; country of origin India; place of origin Barackpore; year of isolation 2006 and the accession number. This makes it much easier for the reader. Note that similar proposals, betasatellte species and isolate descriptors, have been made for betasatellites - see here. https://talk.ictvonline .org/taxonomy/p/taxon omy-history?taxnode_id=20165 479 Note that Briddon, R.W.; Brown, J.K.; Moriones, E.; Stanley, J.; Zerbini, M.; Zhou, X.; Fauquet, C.M. Recommendations for the classification and nomenclature of the DNA-beta satellites of begomoviruses. Arch Virol. 2008, 153(4), 763-81. doi: 10.1007/s00705-007-0013-6. is somewhat out-of-date. In the list of sequences used for the analysis there is a lot of duplication. All the reference sequences (sequences denoted as NC_XXXXXX) should be deleted. These duplicate the actual sequences – so for example NC_009088 is the same as EF373060. In the introduction you say “For theses analyses, we considered all the available MYVMV and betasatellite isolates so far (isolated from mesta plants or associated with mesta plants) in GenBank including the new isolates from Bangladesh (from this study).”. This is said despite the fact that earlier you noted that a second species, Mesta yellow vein mosaic Bahraich virus, is associated with MYVMD and you then appear to include this under the name  MYVMV. Mesta yellow vein mosaic Bahraich virus is far more closely related to Cotton leaf curl Multan virus and Bhendi yellow vein mosaic virus, two other malvaceous begomoviruses, than it is to MYVMV. Also you include isolates of MYVMV not “isolated from or associated with mesta plants” – MH628534 was isolated from sunflower. So, it seems that for inclusion in your analysis it is enough for the species to have been isolated from mesta, not necessarily the isolate. Unfortunately then, in selecting betasatellites for analysis, you go against this apparent rule. You ONLY include betasatelittes actually isolated from mesta, which happens to include at least five species - Kenaf leaf curl betasatellite, Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite, Mesta yellow vein mosaic betasatellite (previously known as “Ludwigia leaf distortion betasatellite”) Tomato leaf curl Joydebpur betasatellite, and Croton yellow vein mosaic betasatellite.  However, unlike for the virus, you do not include isolates the NOT from mesta. My question is – does this haphazard selection of sequences to analyse mean that the final results tell us anything useful? Although there is no mention of it, the phylogenetic trees amount to species trees. The microsatellite analysis may be useful, once all the duplicate sequences are removed but can you take sequences from 5 betasatellite species and say anything useful about what is happening in mesta? Similarly, with 5 species and a small sample set, is there anything useful to be gained from a comparison of genetic diversity in Pakistan India and Bangladesh. One interesting finding overlooked by the authors is that all the betasatellites they sequenced are isolates of Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellte. This gives strong support to the idea that, at least in Bangladesh, mesta yellow vein mosaic disease is caused by the complex Mesta yellow vein mosaic virus and Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellte.",2021-09-10T08:09:18,robertbriddon,Robert Briddon,10.1101/2021.09.05.459025,Molecular evolution and genetic analysis of Mesta yellow vein mosaic virus and associated betasatellites,"Rasel Ahmed, Rajnee Hasan, Md.

I was wondering if you did consider the possibility that sanchytrids are actually branching inside Blastocladiomycota. There is no transcriptomic/phylogenomic data available yet for any member of the shorter-branched Physodermatales. Therefore there is a possibility that they would turn out to be basal to Blastocladiales + sanchytrids, making it premature to create a new phylum for sanchytrids. Also there is very strong support for Blastocladiales + sanchytrids in the tree (the internal branch is actually longer than that at the base of Chytridiomycota, Zoopagomycota and Mucroromycota). So to be phylogenetically consistent across Fungi, one could argue that either the latter three should become multiple phyla, or Blastocladiales + sanchytrids should be in a single phylum, irrespective of the latter's unique traits. In any case, whether sanchytrids deserve to be a separate phylum or not, the very strong support for their relationship to Blastocladiomycota means that this B+S clade is evolutionarily relevant and would arguably deserve a name, like Dikarya for Ascomycota + Basidiomycota + Entorrhizomycota. Any suggestion for that name?

This study demonstrates that V. cholerae colonization is increased by the presence of P. aminovorans in an infant murine intestinal model of infection. Through crystal violet staining and murine intestinal colonization with a ∆vpsL mutant of V. cholerae, it is shown that Vibrio exopolysaccharide (VPS) is necessary for P. aminovorans-dependent enhancement of V. cholerae biofilm formation and intestinal colonization. Microscopy also reveals VPS enrichment in areas of the pellicle with higher P. aminovorans abundance. Lastly, with mutants in accessary matrix proteins RbmA, RbmC, and Bap1, the researchers show that the ability of V. cholerae to form a structurally intact biofilm is necessary for P. aminovorans-dependent enhancement of V. cholerae colonization. Overall, this is a very interesting paper with insightful experiments that sparked a great discussion in our journal club group. This paper gives strong evidence that P. aminovorans promotes V. cholerae colonization in a VPS-dependent manner. With that said, we have some comments that may be beneficial for the authors to address. General comments * May be beneficial to keep y-axis scales for CFUs the same among all figures for more consistency * One-way ANOVA may be a more appropriate test for figures in which multiple comparisons are being made; we advise you to consider consulting a statistician on the appropriate statistical tests to use * The Mann Whitney U test is not a t-test, but is referred to as such in some of the figure legends. * It is mentioned multiple times that crystal violet absorbance was measured at 570nm, although measurements were made at 550nm for all crystal violet figures in the paper. * Discuss possible limitations with Wheat Germ Agglutinin; could WGA also stain GlcNAc produced by P. aminovorans? * Would be beneficial to describe in more detail the purposes of matrix proteins RbmA, RbmC, and Bap1, and why these were chosen to be studied. * One statistical test is mentioned at the end of every figure legend; is the same statistical test being formed on all panels in a given figure? If not, this needs to be clarified. * More details about how CFUs are quantified from pellicles in the results section would be good to add; the steps taken are only briefly mentioned and are a bit difficult to understand. Figure-specific comments * Story may flow better if in vivo data from Figure 2 is added to the end of the paper along with Figure 7 in vivo data; introduce enhanced Vc colonization phenotype with in vitro data first * Would be beneficial to show single and dual species P. aminovorans CFUs in Figure 2B and 2C and also single species P. aminovorans CFUs in Figure 3B to see whether P. aminovorans colonization also increases in the presence of V. cholerae * Address the purpose of the grid in Figure 4A * Figure 5A: Title claims that P. aminovorans increases V. cholerae biofilm formation according to data in Figure 5, but can only make this claim if CFUs are quantified in the in vitro model. * Figure 6 should have a Vc single species control to compare dual species pellicle to.",2021-09-05T15:00:48,,UAB BPJC,10.1101/2021.02.01.429194,Impact of a human gut microbe on Vibrio cholerae host colonization through biofilm enhancement,"Kelsey Barrasso, Denise Chac, Meti D.

In recent years, we have published a review on the microbiological quality of draught beer (2015), the hygiene of tap nozzles (16),  assessment of quality (18), survey of trade quality (19) and assessment of biofilm formation (21).

Thank you for posting this very interesting manuscript. Best, The Sanchez Lab: The manuscript by Willems et al. presents an overview of a new software, AlphaTims, which allows for fast indexing and retrieval of LC-TIMS-MS/MS data. The authors present a clear explanation of how software indexing and data matrix construction works, along with an example of how their software is used to simplify the accession of data from complex samples. This open-source program has the potential to make data more accessible without proprietary software, and has many possible applications in conjunction with further data processing software. Overall,  AlphaTims looks to be an impressive piece of software, and figure 1 especially did a great job of visualizing and explaining the difficult concept of data indexing in 4 dimensions. This was a great, polished read, and very informative in elucidating the experimental process for those who are less familiar with the LC-TIMS-MS/MS workflow. It was also appreciated that the data was publicly available on PRIDE! Below please find a list of critiques that may improve the accessibility of some of the concepts and better illustrate the software’s utility. ●	Figure 1 is very well done and all the terms are well-explained. It may add further clarity if the authors were to add a  part (d) to help visualize what the data looks like once indexed, perhaps with number values. Additionally, the color palette is difficult to interpret when printed in black and white; the authors may wish to consult ColorBrewer. ●	Some of the data on the speed of the software is difficult to conceptualize without benchmark data for comparison. There’s a brief comparison between the program and Bruker’s DataAnalysis on two different systems (one local and one Github VM) with different specifications, which doesn’t provide a lot of context as these do not seem to be directly comparable. While the speed of the software compared to others is not necessarily a major  focal point, as AlphaTIMS carries out different processes to DataAnalysis, it’s still a little difficult to conceptualize the relevance of the times in figure 2, as these events are somewhat decontextualized. With that being said, it was apparent that both systems used solid state drives. Therefore, even if runtimes cannot be directly compared, it may be helpful to note whether the code is CPU-bound, storage speed bound, etc. and suggest what hardware upgrades may help increase performance. ●	The documentation in general is very good! The accessibility and the included explanations for all of AlphaTims’ reading, writing, slicing, and visualization workflows are impressive. However, more examples for other included processing functions (i.e. centroiding) would be helpful. ●	Some more broad data visualizations in figures 3 and 4 would be helpful. Seeing an overall LC-MS and/or TIMS-MS spectrum in figure 3 could help contextualize the complexity of the data, beyond the quality control purposes expressed in the figure. This would also help to visualize the described “polygon filter” - again, not an expressed priority of the paper, but helpful for readers to connect the software to data. Additionally, in figure 4, showing a comparison of the selected peptides between the 6 sample conditions could help to visualize the utility of the software for determining sample optimization. There’s also a slight disconnect in the captions for figure 4 - “cell 24” could refer to In [24] or Out[24]. This is worth clarifying with traditional a, b, c, d, e, f labels. ●	The forward looking statement in the conclusion may provide a great opportunity to expand on future possible applications. For instance, do the authors see this being developed with additional data processing/analysis functionalities, or integrated into new/existing data analysis programs? Is there possible functionality to visualize and compare multiple datasets at once?",2021-08-26T23:28:45,disqus_nXqTRGyBsq,Laura Sanchez,10.1101/2021.07.27.453933,AlphaTims: Indexing trapped ion mobility spectrometry – time of flight data for fast and easy accession and visualization,"Sander Willems, Eugenia Voytik, Patricia Skowronek, Maximilian T.

Your comments will allow us to clarify the points below and significantly improve the quality of our manuscript! Re Q1: Yes indeed we use standardized genotypes for the purpose of having a simple toy figure. The main point we try to convey is that multiple causal effect size configurations can lead to the same observed marginal effects in GWAS. Thus, given GWAS data only, our approach proposes to sample across these causal configurations to estimate heritabilities. As with all toy figures, there is a balance between oversimplification and leading to misinterpretations; we will clarify this better in the legend/text. Re Q2: First, indeed we make the assumption that the true causal effects \beta are independent across SNPs; this is a standard assumption that is made across most heritability work in human genetics and likely a good approximation in real data. That being said, we can drop this assumption then an extra covariance term exists (see bottom pp17) that could potentially be estimated/investigated; here we focus only on the \beta’R\beta term (our estimand of interest). Second, as you clarify and we are in full agreement,  the posterior samples have a covariance structure that is different from identity; i.e. \beta_i and \beta_j post samples are correlated. In the most simple case of the toy example of Fig 1 with two SNPs in perfect LD and with a sparsity model that only allows 1 causal, only one of the \beta’s will have non-zero effect in any configuration; therefore the two betas in the posterior are negatively correlated (r=-1). Or in the case of full infinitesimal model with independence of beta as prior, one can also straightforwardly derive the variance of the posterior as 1/n (1/(1-h2)R + M/(Nh2) I )^-1 (with apologies for self reference see https://www.biorxiv.org/con... or multiple other previous works with similar derivations). In the more general case when there is also a sparsity prior, an analytical solution for the posterior is hard to derive; this motivated us to sample from the posterior of \beta in this work. Third, as defined in pp 17-18, our estimand of interest is \beta’R\beta where \beta are the unknown causal effects (also denoted as h2gene). We rely on an approximation of the posterior of \beta from SuSiE to sample from posterior effects and then approximate a sampling from posterior of \beta’R\beta  (pp19); our proposed estimator has the simple form of avg (\beta’R\beta), where the average is taken across samples from posterior (samples that will have correlations across SNPs, as noted above). We fully acknowledge that other estimators for \beta’R\beta can be proposed (analytical and/or sampling based) that could be potentially more efficient and/or unbiased. In this work we chose to focus on this simple estimator that works reasonably well in simulations and real data. We will revise to clarify all these points!",2021-08-24T17:44:27,bogdanpasaniuc,Bogdan Pasaniuc,10.1101/2021.08.17.456722,Partitioning gene-level contributions to complex-trait heritability by allele frequency identifies disease-relevant genes,"Kathryn S.

Additive genetic variance at a single bi-allelic locus under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is 2pq\beta^2, not just \beta^2, where p and q are allele frequencies and \beta is allele substitution effect. In general, this is 2pq(1+F)\beta^2, where F measures deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. So, genetic variance and heritability at a locus depend on variance of genotypes and allele effects (classic reference for this is Falconer and MacKay, 1996). Hmm, are you skipping variance of genotypes, Var(x), because you standardise your genotypes (which changes what \beta mean)? When you expand to a region, linkage-disequilibrium between loci within the region also kicks in. Also the region will be correlated to other regions, so variance partitioning is not really that meaningful looking just one region or locus at a time. You account for linkage-disequilibrium with your R matrix. But, when working with regions, correlation between estimates of \beta_i and \beta_j also kick in, even though we assume apriori that \beta_i and \beta_j are independent. Your derivation on page 17 works on the prior side, but does this also hold when you work with posteriors of \beta - they are quite correlated and possibly also correlated with genotypes (x) too?

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.14.456176v1#comment-5500367333,biorxivstage,1,"We have recently reported that the Tn5-based epigenomic profiling methods, especially Stacc-seq and CoBATCH, are prone to open chromatin bias ( https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.09.451758v1). Rather than directly address this bias issue, the authors of Stacc-seq argued in this preprint that FC-I normalization (normalizing by input/IgG control) was better than FC-C (normalizing by background) for Stacc-seq etc. data analysis. Based on this, they claimed that our results had “a major analysis issue”. However, the truth is that we had already used both FC-I and FC-C normalization methods and both showed clear open chromatin bias for Stacc-seq and CoBATCH. The fact that our analyses demonstrating that CUT&Tag (5% FPR) showed much lower FPR than Stacc-seq (30% FPR) or CoBATCH (50% FPR) indicated that the high FPRs were not due to “artificially enhanced the relative enrichment of potential open chromatin bias”, but an intrinsic problem of Stacc-seq and CoBATCH. In our opinion, the preprint has several problems, which are detailed below. 1.	The preprint ignored the fact that we had already used both FC-I and FC-C normalization methods. The authors assumed that we only used FC-C for Stacc-seq etc. (Fig. 1A in Liu et al.). However, in fact we used both FC-C and FC-I in our analyses. In Fig. 1c, d and Fig. S2 of our manuscript (Wang et al.), methods labeled with “with IgG” were results from FC-I normalization, and methods without such label were results from FC-C normalization. Importantly, results from both normalizing methods showed clear open chromatin bias for Stacc-seq and CoBATCH (Fig. 1c,d and Fig. S2 in Wang et al.). 2.	The results of global H3K27me3 enrichment at the Polycomb targets in this preprint (Fig. 1C) was contradictory to their claim that using FC-C would cause “complete loss or dramatic reduction of enrichment at true targets for datasets generated by Tn5-based methods”. Fig. 1C of this preprint showed a clear H3K27me3 enrichment around the TSS of Polycomb targets compared to adjacent regions when using FC-C. The difference between results from FC-I and FC-C is caused by the y-scale. The fold change is a relative measurement, so the y-scale of different normalization methods is not directly comparable. If they set the y-scale of FC-C to 0~2, the enrichment pattern would be highly similar to that using FC-I. 3.	The genome browser snapshots of several loci in a large scale (low resolution) could not demonstrate that the results from FC-I and FC-C normalization are globally different. This preprint provided several example loci (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2 in Liu et al.) to show that using FC-C would cause “complete loss or dramatic reduction of enrichment at true targets for datasets generated by Tn5-based methods”. However, showing browser view of very large regions are misleading as the resolution is too low. For genome browser display, the look of the signal track patterns depends on y-scale, x-scale and windowing and smoothing function. When viewing a very large region, the signals are sampled and aggregated by genome browser and are not the raw signals. Thus, the patterns may not reflect the real situation. Indeed, when zoomed-in to check these regions, we found the peak patterns from FC-I and FC-C normalization are highly similar. In addition, examples from several loci could not reflect the global pattern. The global enrichment shown in Fig. 1C of this preprint did not support their conclusion, as discussed in point 2. In summary, our original analysis has already included the normalization method suggested by the authors of this preprint. Results from both normalization methods supported that Stacc-seq and CoBATCH had high open chromatin bias. In fact, the results from this preprint also support our conclusions. In Fig. 2 of this preprint, regardless whether FC-I, FC-C or RPKM were used, the discrete peaks from Stacc-seq etc. were more similar to ATAC-seq peaks, but were totally different from ChIP-seq peaks.

For example, I think the density plots in Figure 3 of this preprint were helpful to share with the vet, but I think the absolute numbers from Figure 1 were also important to communicate. b) If using the barplot strategy, then I think I would want to see the 5 categories from Figure 1 as a possible way to gauge the Positive Predictive Value in new batches of samples (for each of the 3 scores). I think the basic idea is to gauge the impact of other samples that may change the overall frequency of healthy cats (which could in turn affect the positive predictive value).

These updates are going to be really helpful for clarity. To briefly answer: 1) The days listed in figure 1 refer to individually aligned day of estrous cycle - so they aren't actually all exactly the same p day because the animals don't cycle exactly in sync with one another. 2) My understanding is that this is a matter of stylistic preference; I typically see it in figures (like this one) with a large number of subpanels. I suppose the reviewers will decide if they like these summaries or not, and that will likely determine their inclusion or exclusion :) 3) The colored arrows in figure 2 are merely meant to indicate that the x-axis label ""Day of Life"" applies to the figures both to the left and to the right. The arrows could be made black if this is distracting; I was trying to indicate the figures being referred to by matching the arrows to the color of the group. 4) These were Mann Kendall trend over time tests; this is described in the text but perhaps should be called out in the legend as well.

Lot of GWAS studies have revealed that a few variants like rs1421085 in FTO non-coding region are highly associated with obesity. However, none of these variants has been functionally validated in vivo due to tremendous difficulties and huge costs. In this study, the authors firstly demonstrated that a single rs1421085 variant T>C in the non-coding area was a functional point and the mutation from T to C could boost thermogenesis in global knock-in and BAT specific knock-in mice. Mechanistically, T>C mutation could enhance FTO gene expression, which in some way, boost UCP1 expression.  Furthermore, based on the frequency of this mutation in different population around the world, the authors proposed a very intriguing hypothesis that this mutation with increased thermogenesis capacity help human to adapt to coldness, thus in certain way facilitating human to migrate out Africa and spread all the world. This study gives us some fresh view that the SNPs identified from GWAS are functional and that GWAS is an effective way to identify genetic factors for complex diseases. However, there are some concerns. Since this point localizes in non-coding region, which is usually not conserved across species, how the authors could prove this be true in humans? Except FTO, does this variant affect other known important genes like IRX3 and IRX5, or more thermogenesis related genes?

It would be helpful to avoid misinterpretations of our findings. We did not address the risk of endothelial inflammation after vaccination because it is not likely to happen. The circulation levels of spike protein after an mRNA vaccine are ~10’000 times lower than the concentration used in this study. During the first five days after the first dose of an mRNA vaccine, tiny amounts [~30 pg/mL (171.43 fM)] of spike protein could be detected in circulation (Ogata et al., 2021). Most of the spike remains attached to the cell’s surface and does not disperse much from the injection site. Interestingly, the spike was no longer detected in circulation after the second dose, thanks to the antibodies generated with the first dose that quickly and effectively removed the tiny amounts of spike that manage to reach the circulation. In contrast, in our study, the effective concentration of the spike to cause endothelial inflammation was ~1 .6 nM [~300’000 pg/mL], which is a possible concentration in COVID19, where real endothelial damage occurs. Hence, our insights are limited to the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, almost 2’500 million people have been vaccinated until now, and less than 0.001% of the cases present problems. Moreover, vaccination produces antibodies that help deplete spike from circulation, which could help prevent endothelial damage in COVID19. So, in a few words, vaccination is very safe and can even help prevent spike-induced endothelial damage. So, even though inflammatory properties could be attributed to spike, it is still the best antigen to train our immune system to protect us from COVID19.
