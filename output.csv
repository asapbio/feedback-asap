During the RNA/Chimera annealing step, you applied “The samples were incubated at 95℃ for 1 minute and transferred to ice immediately.” However, the original study of Nm-VAQ and other similar experiments usually use gradient and slow cooling to ensure that the RNA and chimera have sufficient time to specifically bind rather than preferentially form secondary structures on their own, thereby affecting the subsequent cleavage of RNase H. This may be the reason for the ‘background’ described in this study and the much higher level of Nm modification seen in Fig 3C than the results in the original article. 2.	In page 7, “PLXNB2, RPL10, and TOP1 were identified as potential candidates for mRNAs with Nm modifications based on various mapping techniques. G498 for PLXNB2, G150 for RPL10, and U877 for TOP1 were the potential sites of 2’-O-methylation”, which only cited reference 29. However, we found ref 29 only reported PLXNB2 as a potential Nm site. Could the authors please point out the provenance of the other two test loci?

While it provides valuable data, the study has limitations that affect the coherence between its main objective and results. The title and introduction suggest a focus on neurotropic viruses associated with epilepsy linked to Onchocerca volvulus (OAE), but the results primarily describe viral diversity without providing evidence of these viruses. Possible explanations for the absence of neurotropic viruses are not discussed, nor are methodological alternatives proposed to address this issue. To improve the narrative, it is recommended to reframe the title and present the work as an exploratory study on viral diversity in blackflies. Methodologically, the sample size (10 blackflies per pool) and the lack of information about the genus of the collected blackflies compromise the representativeness of the data. Additionally, the criteria for excluding incomplete sequences are inconsistent, as incomplete Riboviria sequences were retained, potentially biasing abundance results. Regarding the figures, Figure 2 lacks a clear description of its columns, hindering interpretation. Figure 3 presents phylogenetic trees with barely distinguishable details, complicating analysis. In Figure 4, the point corresponding to Blackfly flavivirus does not clearly cluster with invertebrate hosts, weakening conclusions about its specificity. Analyses based on PCA and dinucleotide composition are interesting but insufficient to infer viral tropism without experimental validation. The supplementary files, although relevant, lack proper descriptions, and the main text does not specify which supplementary figure to consult, limiting their utility. Although the study does not successfully address its main objective, it provides an important starting point for future research on the viral diversity of blackflies and highlights the need for further investigation into their relationship with human diseases in endemic areas.",2024-11-19T16:24:35,jesusvalencianavarro,Jesus Valencia,10.1101/2024.04.05.588247,Cameroonian blackflies (Diptera: Simuliidae) harbour a plethora of (RNA) viruses,"Lander De Coninck, Amber Hadermann, Ludovica Ingletto, Robert Colebunders, Kongnyu Gamnsi Njamnshi, Alfred Kongnyu Njamnshi, John L Mokili, Joseph Nelson Siewe Fodjo, Jelle Matthijnssens",2024-11-08
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.13.623362v1#comment-6595608551,biorxivstage,0,"Dear authors, I am a biology student with an interest in the evolution of animal communication systems, and out of curiosity, I came across your research titled “Prediction of the Next Elements in Chimpanzee Gesture Sequences.” I would like to congratulate you on your innovative approach and the richness of the information you present. The study is very interesting and makes a significant contribution to the field of animal communication, especially by providing a quantitative approach to chimpanzee behavior. However, I have identified a few aspects that could be improved to make the report clearer and more accessible. First, the text refers to a ""Table 2,"" but this table does not appear in the report, which could cause confusion for readers. This might be an issue of incorrect enumeration or an omission, so I would recommend reviewing and correcting this to ensure consistency in data presentation. Regarding the figures, while the information is clear and understandable, some of them could benefit from adjustments in formatting to improve their visual presentation. For instance, in Figure 4, the axes are generically labeled as “X” and “Y”; it would be helpful if these were more specifically defined to aid in interpretation. Additionally, the axis titles are in lowercase, which could be standardized for consistency. In Figure 6, the title is not centered, and some axis subtitles and the legend do not follow the proper formatting, which may make them harder to read. In Figure 8, the abbreviation “NB” is used without an explanation, which could cause ambiguity for readers unfamiliar with the term. Lastly, I believe it would be useful to include a section for keywords, as they are crucial for indexing and searching for the article, thus improving its accessibility and understanding. The work is of high quality, and with these small adjustments, it could further enhance its presentation and clarity. Once again, congratulations on your effort and contribution to the field.",2024-11-19T16:05:20,,Jose Morales Perez ,10.1101/2024.11.13.623362,Predictability of next elements in chimpanzee gesture sequences,"Alexander Mielke, Gal Badihi, Ed Donnellan, Kirsty E.

We greatly appreciate your constructive comments, which help us improve our research. Regarding your concerns about the purity of circRNA purified using oligo dT, we want to emphasize that our purification protocol has been meticulously optimized to minimize the presence of introns and precursor RNA fragments. We were unable to detect any precursors on electrophoresis. Concerning the in vitro expression results, we understand your surprise that circRNA purified with the RNA kit exhibited higher expression levels compared to HPLC-purified circRNA. We are currently investigating potential factors that might influence these outcomes. To address your concerns more directly and transparently, we would be pleased to send you a sample of our purified circRNA. This will allow you to conduct your own tests and comparisons, which we hope will validate the effectiveness of our purification methods and provide additional confidence in our results.",2024-11-18T07:43:31,estherbroset,Esther Broset,10.1101/2024.10.28.620632,A complete approach for circRNA therapeutics from purification to lyophilized delivery using novel ionizable lipids,"Esther Broset, Verónica Lampaya, Ana Larraga, Víctor Navarro, Alexandre López, Diego de Miguel, Álvaro Peña, Juan Martínez-Oliván, Diego Casabona",2024-10-28

The study supports the concept that sleep is a conserved biological function and evolutionarily distinct new features have developed later. The findings that the genes associated with energy metabolism and cellular repair, which play a primordial role of sleep in cellular maintenance in the Lokiarchaeota, suggest the origin and evolutionary purpose of sleep. The results are in line with the previous assumptions regarding the restorative and protective functions of sleep, including cellular maintenance and gene protection. Moreover, such researches can provide valuable information for drug development as conservation and evolutionary background of genes linked to disease could lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. This work has used both phylogenomics and bioinformatics to solve a biological problem. This research illustrates the scope of such studies in finding solutions to many biological problems. Why sleep is necessary and is maintained by evolution is not fully answered. From an evolutionary standpoint, phylogenetic approaches would help to unravel some of the unresolved mysteries of nature.

They construct two models of the Vt-actin complex that are hypothesized to represent a weak state and a strong state in a force-activated allostery model of the catch bond. They use enhanced sampling techniques to estimate the free-energy landscape of the unbinding process in each state, as well as the unbinding kinetics, in absence and presence of pulling forces of variable intensities and directions along the actin filament axis. Their results demonstrate higher kinetic stability for the strong state with respect to the hypothesized weak one, with unbinding kinetics in range of experimental expectations, confirming the viability of a “3-state” (2 bound states, 4 unbinding pathways) kinetic model of the bidirectional catch bond observed in single-molecule experiments. They additionally observe an increase in bond lifetimes for moderate constant pulling force (10-20 pN) in both directions, indicating an intrinsic catch-bond behavior within each “allosteric” state that may superimpose to the overall allosteric one. They show how an external pulling force affects the positioning of the H1 α-helix believed to act as a regulatory motif of the weak-to-strong transition, providing a compelling structural hypothesis for a force-induced allosteric mechanism. Finally, they provide molecular insight on the difference in stability between both states, highlighting the role of a C-terminal extension (CTE) and the redistribution of Vt-actin contacts under force. Comments * We wonder if the nomenclature “Holo” can be confusing at first glance for the reader, given the historical usage of the holo- and apo- prefixes to designate protein constructs with and without their constitutive prosthetic groups (usually non-proteic cofactors) * We suggest that the authors make clearer the composition of the Holo and Aligned protein sequences given the different numbering in 6UPW and 1QKR (that we guess is due to the presence of Metavinculin instead of Vinculin), that in our understanding are identical except for the absence of the leading H1 helix. * In FES calculations, since the constant force (that is, a linear bias) is applied on the same coordinate Q_‖, we expect that the resulting FES could be entirely predicted from the FES at zero force by simple addition of the linear slope, given sufficient exploration of the Q_‖ direction during the OPES-MetaD sampling. This fact could be used by the authors to assess the consistency between the FES computed at different forces. Alternatively, one may want to first aggregate the OPES-MetaD simulations at all forces using appropriate reweighting, and then estimate minimum free-energy paths and free-energy barriers at arbitrary force using the aggregated FES. This approach might lead to a better statistical use of the vast amount of simulations and a smoother estimate of the FES at all forces within the studied range. Finally, the multiple trajectories (20 replicates x 9 force values) could be used in a single bootstrap to assess the statistical uncertainty of the results (see below). * Given the coarse nature of the set of chosen CVs (Q_‖ and Q_⊥) it is unclear whether the Vt is able to regain its canonical binding site during OPES-MetaD, notably because of free rotation with respect to the actin filament. - The authors acknowledge the difficulty in the methods (sec. 5.5) without explicitly stating whether such rebinding events happen at all in their simulations. We believe this is an important piece of information for proper understanding of the FES presented. We would suggest showing time series to clarify how many binding/unbinding events are observed. - One might expect that the absence of recrossing lead to a poor estimate of the free energy difference between the bound and unbound states as well as the height of the binding free energy barrier. On the bright side, the estimate of the unbinding barrier – which is the one they are the most interested in – can still be expected to be reliable. - The authors suggest to run multiple (20) separate OPES-MetaD simulations to compensate for this limitation. It should be acknowledged that independent runs starting from the bound state will not correct for the systematic bias caused by the absence of rebinding events. A bootstrap on these replicas would anyway estimate their statistical error. - We wonder if the use of the more specific CV Q_contact might allow for such recrossing to happen within OPES-MetaD, without the need of aggregating a high number of independent trajectories. In our understanding the authors only used Q_contact to assess the robustness of the free-energy barrier height to the precise choice of the projection space, but did not try to perform OPES-MetaD directly on this CV space, which could be instructive. * The authors analyze the FES by determining a minimum free-energy path using the “String method” as a post-processing method. - The Methods section might benefit from some information about the use of the method, in particular that it is directly applied on the 2D CV-space projected FES (as opposed to a search of a minimum energy path on the full potential energy surface as originally proposed in [50]), and provide details about initialization (choice of end points for the string, number of nodes, initial interpolation) and robustness to these parameters in the converged paths and corresponding barrier estimates. - Since the FES are aggregated from 20 independent OPES-MetaD runs, it might be relatively straightforward to estimate errors (for example using bootstrapping) and provide error bars on Fig 2c. We believe this would strengthen the significance of the observed barrier difference. * One may be concerned about the significance and reliability of the constructed “Aligned” state, since this state was constructed by aligning Vt to another conformation (in what we could refer to as “docking-by-homology”) with little experimental confirmation that such a state is stable in vitro. We understand that the model constitutes the core hypothesis of the whole computational approach, and that the consistency of the computational outcomes with single-molecule experiments themselves validates its plausibility. Nevertheless, it could be argued that lower binding affinity and lifetime are to be expected from a suboptimal binding partner in a suboptimal binding pose. This raises the question of whether the proposed model corresponds to a specific binding mode in reality, or if the results could be reproduced with a different alignment. Is this ruled out by the stability observed in the 500 ns simulations shown in Fig S1? * In Sec 3.2 §4, the authors say “these results [...] do not quantitatively explain the observed experimental results, since the experimental changes in lifetime shown in Fig. 1D reflect a net 1.4 kcal/mol change in barrier in the negative direction, and 0.6 kcal/mol in the positive direction (if one assumes a constant prefactor the kinetic rate constant)”. It was somewhat unclear to us where these values come from (Are they computed from the fitted 3-state model in SI S1? At a specific value of the pulling force?) and how exactly they are compared to the computed barriers for Holo and Aligned to conclude to a discrepancy (Overestimated?) * In Sec 3.4 §3, the authors convincingly remark that in two out of five simulations of Holo+H1 state pulled towards the barbed end, the conformation of H2–H5 becomes more similar to the Aligned (unbound Vt) structure, suggesting a first step in the strong → weak allosteric transition. We wonder if (i) the specific contacts made with actin and (ii) the specific intra-domain contacts of H1 with the H2–H5 bundle are also indicative of a displacement toward the Aligned state, since this would be an even stronger argument validating the proposed model. * Given the relative simplicity of the supposed allosteric motif and the suggestive results of the Holo+H1 simulations, we cannot help but wonder whether the authors also tried to ""unfold"" the H1 helix in the Aligned model with a N-terminal pulling force since this seems a very natural test to look for equally suggestive indications of a weak → strong allosteric transition under force. * Typos or writing remarks: - Fig 1B: The caption is inconsistent with the figure. In the caption, p₁ denotes the COM of Vt helices H2–H5, p₂ the COM of actin A1/A2 and p₃ the COM of actin A4/A5. On the figure instead (p₁, p₂, p₃) → (p₃, p₁, p₂). - Some repetitions that might be elegantly avoided x “capture the difficult-to-capture” (abstract) x “protein of interest [...] on our molecule of interest” (introduction  §1) x “takes into account a Boltzmann weighted average over all possible configurations [...] a Boltzmann weighted average over all possible configurations” (introduction §4) - Typos x “FimH-manose” → “FimH-mannose” (introduction §8) x “which is the the direction” (3.1 §1) x “These approximate one-dimensional free energy pathways also give us a way to define when the system has crossed into the unfolded state” → Maybe the authors meant “unbound state” (3.1 §1) x “not all of the catch bond need come from” → “need to come from” (3.2 §3) x “we note that these results are suggestive, they do not quantitatively” → We wonder if the authors intended a formulation along the lines of: “we note that despite being suggestive, these results do not quantitatively” (3.2 §4) x “a constant prefactor the kinetic rate constant” → “a constant prefactor for the kinetic rate constant” (3.2 §4) x “grafted to our Holo structure random orientation” → “grafted to our Holo structure with a random orientation” (3.4 §2) x “TIP3 water” → “TIP3P water” (5.1 §2) Acknowledgements This report was written after a journal club given by OLC in the bussilab group meeting.

Comparative genomics, which is an essential tool in biological research, is a very potent method that yields biological insights that are not possible with any other approach. It could also help us understand the human genome study, which has the potential to help us comprehend human sleep and sleep disorders. Phylogenomics gives a more profound comprehension of the discoveries made possible by comparative genomics. The results of this study indicate that the calcium signaling and synaptic transmission involved in sleep regulation are conserved across phyla, and a simple model organisms like Chlamydomonas may be useful in elucidating higher-order, complex behaviors such as sleep.

We fully agree that, ideally, certain wet lab experiments might have strengthened our findings to provide additional insights. However, there was no funding for our ongoing effort. If adequate funding were to be available, we would have pursued a certain set of experiments that we thought would add value to our work. This limitation is transparently discussed in our manuscript, and we consider our current data a valuable ""stepping stone"" for additional work in this exciting area of research. Looking ahead, we are well-positioned to undertake follow-up experiments, contingent upon the availability of appropriate funding and other resources such as access to the strains. However, we do recognize the challenges involved in maintaining and rearing such specialized organisms in the laboratory setting. For example, replicating their native hydrothermal vent conditions and performing wet lab operations under those constraints condition pose additional significant technical and logistical hurdles. These unique challenges underscore the complexity and significance of our research. With support, we would eagerly and carefully advance this aspect of our research in the future. Regarding your comment on sleep and circadian cycles in this organism, the identified sleep orthologs underscore that their functional characteristics diverge from those in human sleep processes. From the circadian clock perspectives, organisms whose circadian clocks have periodicities that correspond with those of their cyclic surroundings have survival advantage than those whose periodicities do not. If the development of circadian clocks was driven by circadian resonance, then animals with ~24h periodicity should be more fit in a 24-hour environment than in any other periodic or aperiodic time scale. Alternatively, the persistence of functional clocks and photoentrainment mechanisms implies that circadian clocks provide some ""intrinsic adaptive advantage"" to organisms in the absence of cyclical environments, where there is no apparent need to synchronize behavioral and metabolic processes with the geophysical cycles ( https://doi.org/10.1186/1740-3391-3-7). The inherent benefit of clock mechanisms, there, is most likely derived from their ability to help coordinate the organisms' numerous internal metabolic functions. In extreme habitats like hydrothermal vents, in the absence of photic cues, organisms likely rely on alternative timing mechanisms, such as temperature or chemical gradients, adapted to their unique environmental niche. In organisms such as Lokiarchaeota, the absence of circadian regulation due to the extreme hydrothermal environment may have driven the evolution of alternative timing mechanisms. Without light cycles, these organisms likely rely on other environmental cues, such as temperature fluctuations or chemical gradients, to regulate physiological processes. This adaptation might provide them with flexible metabolic and behavioural responses suited to their habitat. This suggests that evolutionary forces and selective environmental pressures unique to hydrothermal vents shaped a different evolutionary pathway for metabolic, and chemosynthetic mechanisms for survival than light-regulated, temporal mechanisms seen in surface-dwelling and terrestrial species. It's possible that daily and seasonal variations during evolution further honed the organisms for survival.",2024-11-05T08:41:43,seithikurippurpandiperumal,Seithikurippu R Pandi-Perumal,10.1101/2024.11.01.621620,Unraveling the Mysteries of Sleep: Exploring Phylogenomic Sleep Signals in the Recently Characterized Archaeal Phylum Lokiarchaeota near Loki’s Castle,"Seithikurippu R Pandi-Perumal, Konda Mani Saravanan, Sayan Paul, David Warren Spence, Saravana Babu Chidambaram",2024-11-03

My journal club recently read your paper, and we were very impressed by how thorough your experiments were. We also appreciated how much converging evidence you included for elucidating the role of the ADGRG1 gene in Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Here are some comments I wanted to provide as possible room for improvement. Starting in Figure 1 but present in the whole paper— is there a reason why female mice were not included in your inducible knockout line P2ry12? Without female mice included from this genotype, it seems hard to make conclusions about the data that also extend to females. In Figure 3, I was a bit confused why you used unpaired two-tailed t-tests to analyze this data. The data doesn’t appear to be normally distributed (specifically in figures 3b and 3d), and t-tests assume the data is normally distributed. Additionally, it was unclear whether you accounted for technical replicates in dendrites from the same animal. I would recommend a nested ANOVA be performed to better analyze this data set because it could account for dependency in your dendrite measurements. In Figure 4, it was difficult to interpret the results of the Morris water maze given that ANOVAs do not perfectly analyze percentages. It would be helpful if, in this section, the data was analyzed by a chi-square test or another statistical test that can more accurately depict frequency differences. As another suggestion, it may be more easily understandable if the target quadrant were compared to each of the three non-target quadrants separately as opposed to all at once. It currently seems as though the non-target quadrant results are skewed by the 3:1 ratio of non-target to target quadrant presence. Overall, I really enjoyed reading this paper.

Ali basically said that over-estimation sometimes happens. Indeed, we agree that the map provides the best judgement of resolution; however we did not have a way to report a different numerical estimate of the resolution. In our case, the map, despite its limited resolution, was able to provide us with the biological insights reported in the paper. First, we used the AlphaFold predicted structure of the monomer, which is also highly similar to the structure of that in the bundled NINJ1 filament (Nature 2023), to assist model building. All we needed to do was to bend the helices as guided by the positions of the glycine residues in these two transmembrane (TM) helices. Second, the bend in the TM helices is obvious in the map even at a resolution lower than reported by the program. Third, we performed extensive mutagenesis on NINJ1 to validate its structure. Fourth, the observation that the concave side of NINJ1 oligomers is hydrophobic (suggesting a nanodisc model), rather than hydrophilic (suggesting a hydrophilic pore model), is clear even in the 2D classes, which strongly supports our nanodisc or cookie cutter model for NINJ1 to induce membrane loss as the mechanism of NINJ1-mediated membrane rupture. Fifth, our membrane staining that showed NINJ1 structures released to the culture supernatant as containing membranes inside further supports our conclusion of the nanodisc model. Finally, a couple of currently lab members (not authors in the paper) have tried to reprocess the data: single particle processing did not yield anything interpretable, and helical processing (as performed in the paper) without symmetry gave a lower resolution volume with less artifacts if more cycles of heterogeneous refinement were used to remove more junk particles. Nonetheless the map showed the same general features as the published map with strikingly bend at both TM helices. We have deposited all primary data (EMPIAR-12325), so please feel free to reprocess the data to see if you could obtain a better map – it would be great! I waited to respond to your comment because despite we deposited the primary data months ago, they are still not approved or released.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.29.595696v1#comment-6583077328,biorxivstage,2,"Dear Authors, Thank you for sharing this exciting work on the role of ABA and GI in recruiting CO at FT promoter to activate its transcription (and flowering). I appreciate the detailed analysis and valuable insights you've provided. I have a few questions and observations that may help clarify some aspects of the study: 1.	Higher CO in aba1-6 mutants at ZT12 In figure 2A, a slight increase in CO expression could be observed in aba1-6 mutants compared to WT plants though this expression declines at ZT16. Further, a higher CO expression is detected at ZT12 and ZT16 in SUC2::CO:CIT-aba1-6 compared with SUC2::CO:CIT (in WT background). It remains somewhat unclear as to why the lack of ABA is leading to a slight (yet) increase in CO transcription. It is noted that in 9 days old seedlings at ZT16 (figure 2B), there is a decline in CO expression yet aba1-6 mutants transformed with SUC2:CO:CIT in figure 2A have a higher CO at ZT16 than WT transformed with SUC2:CO:CIT. What could be the reason behind that. Finally, it will be valuable if authors could measure the CO-FT expression at ZT12 in 9 days old seedlings (like they did for 13 days old). 2.	Higher Pol-II occupancy at CORE in WT In figure 4B, a higher enrichment/occupancy of RNA Pol II could be detected at TSS of FT in WT compared with SUC2::HA:CO aba1-6 and SUC2::HA:CO gi100. Yet, these lines flower much earlier than WT (figure 5B). How do authors explain this discrepancy as low Pol II occupancy would lead to a lower FT (and delayed flowering). Moreover, it will be interesting if authors could quantify and compare the FT expression in WT (Col-0), WT (with either SUC2::CO:CIT or SUC2::HA:CO), aba1-6 (with either SUC2::CO:CIT or SUC2::HA:CO), and gi-100 (with either SUC2::CO:CIT or SUC2::HA:CO). For example, do authors expect FT levels to be same in aba1-6, gi-100 (transformed with SUC2::HA:CO) as they flower nearly at the same time (Figure 5B). Moreover, as SUC2::HA:CO aba1-6 gi-100 show a slight delay in flowering compared with either SUC2::HA:CO aba1-6  or SUC2::HA:CO gi-100, it will be interesting to analyse FT transcript accumulation between genotypes. Taken together, addressing these points will increase the readers understanding and make the paper more concise. 3.	 ChIP and RNA Pol II occupancy assayed at ZT12 (not ZT16) In figure 3,4, and 5 the ChIP assays and RNA Pol II occupancy was quantified at ZT12. CO transcript peaks around that time point in long day (LD) conditions but the FT peak is observed at ZT16. Previously, it has been shown that reduced FT peak at ZT16 leads to delay in flowering ( https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.13557). Authors mention CO binding is observed at ZT12 at CORE (line 329-331) but the delayed flowering phenotype is justified by FT levels so it will be interesting to check CO binding together with RNA Pol II enrichment at ZT16 and then compare both these assays (ZT 12 and ZT16). 4.	RNA Pol II Occupancy at TSS in WT vs. SUC2::HA:CO abi1-6 and SUC2::HA:CO gi-100 with Delayed Flowering in WT SUC2::HA:CO: gi-100 and SUC2::HA:CO: abi1-6 lines show a drastic decline in Pol II occupancy at TSS of FT, yet these lines flower significantly earlier than WT.  Would you consider discussing possible mechanisms by which this delay occurs, despite higher Pol II occupancy, to help clarify this interesting finding? Finally, the  SUC2::CO:CIT gi-100 lines flower nearly at same time as SUC2::CO:CIT (figure 5B). Although in supplementary figure 9, an increase in bolting time (flowering in terms of number of days) in SUC2::CO:CIT gi-100 lines could be seen. A few additional details or a discussion of possible mechanisms might help contextualize this observation. Thank you again for sharing this preprint.

My perspective is as follows: The examples of programmed aging you provided, such as the death of octopuses after laying eggs, are indeed programmed, as we also mentioned in this paper. In fact, we do not deny the widespread existence of programmed aging. What we aim to illustrate is the diversity of aging mechanisms. This diversity inevitably leads to the reality that some species experience completely programmed aging, while in others, aging is triggered by a systemic collapse induced by accumulated damage, and in yet others, it may be activated by assessing the extent of damage and environmental conditions. In the latter two cases, non-programmed aging could result from an initial adaptation to deficiencies in damage repair mechanisms. Alternatively, it could arise from the evolutionary loss of programmed mechanisms found in species with programmed aging, as the diversity in aging programs implies the possibility for such mechanisms to both emerge and be lost in the course of evolution. In cases of damage-induced aging, the continuous occurrence of damage, along with species-specific levels of repair and adaptations to repair deficiencies, can also produce aging processes with programmed characteristics. However, viewing this type of aging solely as a fully programmed process would clearly hinder our understanding of aging mechanisms across different species.",2024-10-31T23:21:31,disqus_HDwK8oiOzj,Li Chen,10.1101/2024.10.28.620557,"Cross-Species Analysis Reveals No Universal Programmed Aging Mechanism: Insights from Single-Cell Transcriptomics in Zebrafish, Fruit Fly, and Nematode","Yunhui Niu, Dongzhi Wu, Sen Zhang, Hong Zheng, Xing Wu, Jiansong Chen, Yunze Zhang, Tao Zhang, Wenhui He, Li Chen",2024-10-29

The below review is the result of this exercise and therefor reflects the thoughts and concerns of several people. We hope this helps you with your way forward to publish the paper in a good journal. Review: The manuscript by De Tito et al. reports a hitherto unknown role for ATG9 in recruitment of PI4K2A to damaged lysosomes to control the levels of PI(4)P, lysosomal membrane contact site formation with the ER, and lipid transfer from ER to damaged lysosomes. They report that this mechanism is controlled by ARFIP2, which shuttles between the Golgi where it anchors ATG9 and lysosomes, and by the AP-3 complex, which mediates retrieval of ATG9 from lysosomes. Finally, the authors show a role for their proposed mechanism in lysosome damage induced by Salmonella infection. The manuscript deals with the timely topic of lysosomal damage repair and PI4K2A was recently emerging as a key player in this process. Mechanisms for PI4K2A recruitment to the sites of damaged lysosomes were so far elusive. Although the manuscript is certainly of interest for the field, the presented evidence on which the claims and the proposed model are based on seem not always substantial enough and further work is required. Major concerns •	Novelty and generalization: Although the findings suggest new functions for ATG9A and ARFIP2, they overlap significantly with previous work on autophagic and lysosomal repair pathways. The novelty of these findings, in comparison to earlier research, could be emphasized more clearly. •	The claim that ARFIP2 ""modulates lipid transfer for lysosomal repair"" could benefit from additional direct evidence linking lipid transfer to lysosomal recovery and ARFIP2's specific role in this process. There is only one in vitro experiment directly showing lipid transfer modulation by ARFIP2 (Fig. 5K). The authors should use the ARFIP2 W99A mutant in this experiment to test whether lipid transfer modulation is specific and according to their model. •	A central claim of the manuscript is a role for ARFIP2 in the repair of damaged lysosomes. The gold standard assay in the field is recovery of lysotracker fluorescence after LLOME-induced damage as shown in Fig. 2G. The way the experiment is presented does not instill confidence. The effects are relatively modest, it is unclear how the statistics were done, the representative images in the supplement only remotely resemble lysotracker stainings, how a reliable lysosome number from these images could be extracted is unclear, it is not shown whether and how much the cells express GFP-ARFIP2, the time points of the images do not match the relevant time points in the quantification, and the lysosome number in the different samples before LLOME treatment is not factored in. •	The major lysosome repair assay in the manuscript is Galectin staining. This is a rather indirect assay as compared to the lysotracker recovery assay as it shows the damage rather than the repair. Could there be repaired lysosomes that still are positive for Galectin? Is the total Galectin expression level the same in the cell lines and conditions used?  Furthermore, spot quantification for lysosomal damage markers like LGALS3 (Figure 2f) does not account for cell size or density, potentially leading to misinterpretation of the data. The authors further need to show lysotracker recovery in ATG9 loss of function to substantiate their claims. •	The authors show that ARFIP2 and ATG9 affect PI4K2A localization in cells. The “delivery” of PI4K2A to lysosomes, however, which is a central claim in this manuscript, is insufficiently demonstrated. Same is true for the “retrieval” of ATG9: The authors claim that AP-3 and ARFIP2 are important for the retrieval of ATG9A vesicles. Even though they show effects of these proteins on ATG9A presence at the lysosomes, they never manage to show that retrieval really is impaired. I am not fully sure if it is possible to make videos that convincingly show this. Either they should try that, or they should not hammer so hard on the word retrieval when they never show it specifically. •	The dynamic interactions of the relevant components need to be better demonstrated and characterized. E.g. interactions ATG9-PI4K2A interaction needs to be proven and characterized better (e.g. by co-IP, immunogold or similar techniques). Otherwise the role of ATG9 is much secondary, and should be a ARFIP2-mainly focused paper. The experiments in figure 4H and 4G seem ideally suited for this purpose but the authors fail to show the relevant components in the same blot. •	The increased formation of membrane contact sites is insufficiently demonstrated. The authors need to use electron microscopy, super resolution microscopy, SPLICS or other appropriate techniques to make this claim •	The way of quantifying protein localization to lysosomes (intensity lysosomes/total) seems heavily dependent on the lysosome coverage of the cells. In conditions where to my impression the overall number of lysosomes also changes, I would like to see a negative control that demonstrates that the enhanced lysosome localization is not just by chance, since there are more lysosomes. This applies for instance to Figure 4E+F and 5A+B. •	I am not satisfied with the data analysis they presented. The authors should indicate the statistical test for each piece of data they analysed including an explanation, why did they chose particular test. For instance, in fig. 2g they compare the amount of puncta or lysosomes (it is not clear as well) in the cell in a pairwise manner. It would be more appropriate to implement a statistical test that can compare the curves fitted with the data points or a test which can compare each time point individually, i.e. Kaplan-Meier plot. Minor comments •	The zooms generally miss scalebars •	Which part of the picture the zoom is from is often not indicated •	Many of the images are hard to interpret because of low contrast, I would recommend to put their individual channels in grey •	Fig3f. requires a better representative image and although there is a line indicated there is no line plot •	Fig. 1c: show quantification for pS6K •	Fig. 2b: data points are the same as figure 1b •	Fig. 3: Live-imaging of ATG9A with AP-3D1 is needed",2024-10-30T14:15:51,disqus_USVOnz2Dvr,Anonymous,10.1101/2024.07.23.604321,ATG9A and ARFIP2 cooperate to regulate PI4P levels for lysosomal repair,"Stefano De Tito, Eugenia Almacellas, Daniel Dai Yu, Wenxin Zhang, Emily Millard, Javier H.
