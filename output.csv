Specifically, the team utilizes transmission mode MALDI followed by cold plasma ionization source (SICRIT) with analytes then being analyzed in a timsTOF Pro. The work was able to achieve subcellular MSI which they  showed across a variety of tissues and cells to highlight their application. Furthermore, they fortuitously discovered that pre-staining with cresyl violet enhanced ionization of nucleotides and helped facilitate subcellular imaging. Overall this paper provided excellent figures with exciting data, was highly rigorous in the reporting of the lipid species and nomenclature used, and with the instrumental design and assessment of the staining impact on the resulting images. We also enjoyed that this could provide staining and MSI on the same tissue rather than having to take serial sections; this is a really exciting aspect of this work. Below please find critiques for the authors considerations. 1. The comparison between pre and post CV staining was striking. Perhaps a little more discussion here could be helpful, it seems like in addition to the sample preparation creating the cavitations, do the authors posit that CV itself might be acting as a matrix as well to help facilitate ionization? Would other stains have a similar effect? 2. Our understanding of this instrument is that this is still fundamentally MALDI-2 like, in that the SICRIT is acting as a secondary ionization source, can the authors perhaps confirm this or make it more clear in the writing, that both neutral and ions are created during the transmission mode and further ions are created by the SICRIT. If this is not what is happening, then perhaps the writing could be adjusted. 3. For all MSI figures, it would be helpful to include the SMART ( https://doi.org/10.1002/jms.4904) reporting standards in the figures both main text and SI are encouraged to increase the transparency of the experiments. One thing we discussed was the time these experiments might take for the areas and the spatial resolutions achieved. 4. One thing that was unclear, is the intersection of how the cold plasma vs the more traditional MALDI-2 would drive the specifics for ionization of the nucleotides and lipids. Specifically could the CV be compatible with normal MALDI-2? We appreciate that the same spatial resolutions would not be achieved but it would be interesting to really isolate how the different changes really impact the subsequent detection of analytes to better understand how to optimize the system or pick the system for different biomolecules in the future. 5. Figure 4D doesn’t seem to help aid in the excitement of this methodology, specifically the microscopy doesn’t match the ion images. Or did the authors expect that only one cell line would be different compared to the other three? Could they better comment on some of the biology maybe if this what they expected?Figure 4C. Was the point to demonstrate colocalization of the dyes with the lipids? It could be helpful to highlight why the data might be meaningful and address the outstanding biological challenges. Figure4 B, C, D weren’t in order for increasing spatial resolution. 6. Can the authors comment on why only positive mode was done for the lipid analysis? Can this set up do negative mode? It might be helpful to comment on to better understand the rationale. 7. Why was 6 ppm vs 5 ppm for the lipid annotations? Typically for Organic Chemistry or Natural Products we utilize 5 ppm for HRMS. 8. Figure 3 this is very cool - is this known that Adenosine has a punctate pattern? The significance of the findings was not discussed, if this is a new biological observation that would be helpful to highlight this more so that the importance of subcellular metabolomics is really needed. Highlighting the significance of the findings would help bolster the future applications.",2025-07-01T20:31:41,disqus_nXqTRGyBsq,Laura Sanchez,10.1101/2025.05.13.653655,Subcellular mass spectrometry imaging of lipids and nucleotides using transmission geometry ambient laser desorption and plasma ionisation,"Reuben S.E.

We commend this work for establishing three key advances: The authors conclusively demonstrate that MIA-induced Treg deficiency and epigenetic dysregulation—drives ASD-like phenotypes. Crucially, adoptive transfer of healthy Tregs postnatally rescues social deficits and repetitive behaviors in offspring. This aligns with our previous findings that MIA offspring exhibit peripheral Th1/Th17 skewing (Zhipeng Xu et al. Nat Neurosci 2021), but extends the paradigm by proving offspring Tregs are autonomous therapeutic targets. The identification of sustained Foxp3 demethylation in offspring Tregs reveals a transgenerational immune imprinting mechanism. This explains the longevity of neurodevelopmental deficits and offers a postnatal intervention window—complementing our prenatal maternal Treg-focused strategy (Chunxiang Shen et al. Cell Rep 2024). While our previous work showed MIA disrupts placental Treg/ macrophage balance (via SR-A-dependent Sjp90α intervention), this preprint demonstrates how placental inflammation permanently programs offspring immunity. The data bridge in utero insults to postnatal neuropathology, forming a neuroimmunological continuum. This work redefines ASD as a neuroimmunological continuum spanning generations. By validating offspring Treg deficiency as a central pathological mechanism, it expands therapeutic opportunities beyond prenatal windows. We advocate integrated maternal-offspring strategies to disrupt this intergenerational cycle.",2025-07-01T15:19:27,disqus_U7b1J5Bi3a,徐志鹏(zhipengxu),10.1101/2025.01.06.631430,Maternal immune activation imprints a regulatory T cell deficiency in offspring that drives an autism-like phenotype,"Pierre Ellul, Gwladys Fourcade, Vanessa Mhanna, Nicolas Coatnoan, Susana Bodula, Danielle Seilhean, Laura Mouton, Gwendolyn Marguerit, Richard Delorme, Tian Mi, Ben Youngblood, Michelle Rosenzwajg, Nicolas Tchitchek, David Klatzmann",2025-01-08

Personally I'd have interpreted these results differently at times, but I understand the need to produce compelling narratives... For example, if you put the reaction time difference (20 ms) in context, you could have a different interpretation of relevance. One such context is the limits of human perception, which is about 5 ms for very sort stimuli, and scales with stimuli over about 250 ms. Another point up for discussion is effect sizes (rather than 'significance'). Normally if I do an analysis with >1000 samples/participants, and I get a p value of 0.048, that means the effect size is so small that even if it's not random, it's an extremely small effect size (I'm not quite as experienced with GLMMs, so I lack a bit of intuition here). Personally I would scramble the participant results across stimuli and see what the p-value turns out to be, just to be sure that it's not just overfitting (as far I can see, there's quite a few parameters in the model). I've definitely seen cases where this level of 'significance' can be generated by better than 1 in 20 odds, and I assume that this is related to overfitting and hidden non-randomness in any randomly-generated data. Whether it's still significant or not, I'd prefer to see effect sizes discussed in some sort of meaningful way. Like, how many times would I have the same preferences as another animal when selecting stimuli? Perhaps that's the horizontal bar with whiskers in Fig. 1A? It'd be nice to know the number (e.g. 55%?). I'd also be interested to see a graph where the same (or equivalent) measure of agreement was plotted for human-human agreement, animal-animal agreement, and human-animal agreement. And I don't think this statement is properly qualified, ""Our global survey discovered that humans share acoustic preferences with other animals, spanning insects, frogs, birds, and non-human mammals."" Technically you showed a group-level effect, which says nothing about the individual species. So one might wrongly take away from your statement that humans share acoustic preferences with each of these animals. When in actuality, it could be that a few species have a strong enough effect to bring up the average, and other species may share no acoustic preferences. Still, cool paper. But I would be open to the possibility that the results are actually random, and perhaps not try to make such a strong claim with effects that are borderline random.",2025-06-30T15:27:28,disqus_kHaiH8cKyG,John McBride,10.1101/2025.06.26.661759,Humans share acoustic preferences with other animals,"Logan S James, Sarah C Woolley, Jon T Sakata, Courtney B Hilton, Michael J Ryan, Samuel A Mehr",2025-06-27
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.30.657050v2#comment-6729593645,biorxivstage,1,"The search for an optimal stimulation control input that ensures the transition of a given neural system from an initial state to a target state—where the modeling is performed using a generative modeling method—is of utmost importance [1]. Recently, the Koopman formalism has been used to convert the nonlinear generative model into an equivalent linear system with the aid of an infinite-dimensional operator [2], facilitating the design of optimal control inputs [3]. However, the author believes that any control input (including an optimal one) can only be designed if the nonlinear generative model is controllable. If the nonlinear generative model is controllable, then its equivalent linear system representation is also controllable. We now state some expressions of accessibility for nonlinear discrete-time systems, as proposed in [4,5,6]. \textbf{Theorem 1:} Consider a nonlinear discrete-time system of the form \begin{align} z(t+1)=f(z(t),u(t)),\,\,\forall\,\, z(t)\in\mathbb{Z}, u(t)\in\mathbb{U} \label{eq1} \end{align} The state--set $\mathbb{Z}$ is a connected manifold of dimension $n$ and $\mathbb{U}\subset \text{clos}\,\,\text{int}\,\,\mathbb{U}$ which is also connected in nature. If the system given by Eq. (\ref{eq1}) is analytic then the following properties hold true \begin{itemize} \item The system is \textit{forward} accessible if and only if \begin{equation} \text{dim}\,\,\mathcal{L}^{+}(z)=n \end{equation} \item The system is \textit{backward} accessible if and only if \begin{equation} \text{dim}\,\,\mathcal{L}^{-}(z)=n \end{equation} \item The system is \textit{transitive} if and only if \begin{equation} \text{dim}\,\,\mathcal{L}(z)=n \end{equation} \end{itemize} For further details on how to calculate the Lie derivatives, please see [4]. \textbf{Remarks:} The paper cited in [3] for designing optimal control input through the lens of Koopman operator theory is [7], which assumes that the original nonlinear system is controllable. If the assumption is true, then it is always possible to reach from any initial state to any final state under the influence of a finite control input within a finite amount of time. If some states are unreachable, due to physical constraints on the control input as claimed in [3], then the original assumption that the nonlinear system is controllable is not true, and the design procedure proposed is not valid. \vspace{5mm} Now, if the nonlinear system is not controllable, then we need to look in the direction of reachability. Reachability analysis aims to determine all possible future states that a system can attain, starting from uncertain initial conditions and incorporating any system uncertainties. The reachability analysis of linear systems and nonlinear continuous systems for which dynamics is known has received a great deal of attention in the literature [8]. Recently, the concept of matrix measures has been extended to systems on time scales (which includes systems on continuous, discrete or hybrid systems) [9]. Thus, the reachability analysis of discrete--time systems can be proved using its corresponding matrix measures. As an alternative approach, one can look in the direction of constrained zonotypes which has been proposed to perform reachability analysis of nonlinear discrete--time systems [10].

In this work, the authors used an ancestral reconstruction of the LGF transcription factor family to identify the possible identities of the major branching transcription factors to study how enthalpic and entropic ligand binding modes may have evolved over time. They show using both DSF and ITC how the thermal stability of ancestral reconstructed TF’s is lost while the thermodynamic binding components gradually switch for different carbon substrates from an entropic to enthalpic binding mode. The authors follow up their thermodynamic experiments with structural studies of the crystallized ancestral TF’s with their respective substrates bound to provide a structural basis for their thermodynamic observations. Their structural analysis suggests two major sources for the thermodynamic binding modes: first, the substrate binding site evolved away from predominantly bulky hydrophobic residues in the most distant ancestor to smaller polar residues which resulted in a change in ligand binding towards forming specific hydrogen bonds both with the TF directly but also through an extensive water network (enthalpic component). Second, the authors compared the most distantly related TF’s to illustrate the evolution of greater protein stability as illustrated by the greater order exhibited by Anc4, particularly in a loop region that is distal to the binding site. Further, they also show that ligand binding to Anc1 does not induce a greater degree of order compared to the apo protein which they propose represents a redistribution of entropy away from the ligand binding site. Major points Point 1. The authors propose that Anc1 has a spatial redistribution of entropy away from the ligand binding site to the distal loops to compensate for the loss of conformational entropy upon binding. Can they test this hypothesis by truncating or stabilizing (by point mutation) the loops? Despite a cooler earth at present, there are still organisms that live at hot temperatures. Do the extent orthologues in these organisms show entropically driven binding? Do the ancestors reported in this function as transcription factors at higher temperatures? Can the authors propose an experiment to test this? It’s interesting that Anc1 is the most thermally stable of the TF’s (based on the hypothesized relationship between earth temperature and protein thermal stability) yet the structure suggests it’s the most disordered compared to Anc4. Can the authors comment on how this fits within their proposed model? Point 2. The possibility that ancestral reconstruction artificially stabilizes proteins has been acknowledged in the literature (e.g. PMID 27413048). Are the authors concerned that the changes in stability observed in their work might be due to the stabilizing effect of consensus mutations? Point 3. The authors focus on the LBD of the LGF family for structural studies and point out that Anc1 (the most distant ancestor) exhibits a greater level of disorder compared to the most recent ancestor Anc4. Is this level of disorder also expected to occur in the DNA binding domain or is it disorder unique to the LBD? In other words, does evolution only act on one domain of this family or are there correlated changes to the DBD as well (allosteric mechanism)? Point 4. It’s interesting that D-fucose binding was largely lost by Anc2 (or not tested?), can the authors provide a structural reason for that similar to their analysis with Anc4? Further, with respect to Figure 4 can authors show (perhaps just an AlphaFold prediction) what the composition of the substrate binding site looks like between each ancestor? Was there a sudden change between Anc1 and Anc2 in composition or was it more gradual (also given the D-fucose binding is almost lost between Anc1 and Anc2 - again was that actually tested)? Point 5. “It should be noted that he apo and ᴅ-fucose-bound ΔAnc1 structures were obtain from crystals from same crystal screening drop i.e., the observed differences are not due to differences in crystallization conditions”. Was this a co-crystallization experiment where two crystals were looped from a single drop - one crystal led to a structure with fucose bound and the other was apo? Crystals with different symmetry (and different crystal packing) can grow in the same drop from identical conditions. The listed space groups in Supplementary Table 2 indicated that the space group was different for the apo and fucose-bound Anc1. Is there concern that the conformational change observed between holo and apo-protein is influenced by the differences in crystal packing? The cell dimensions are similar, can the authors check that the data indexing is consistent? Point 6. The authors point out that LacI is a functional homodimer in Figure 1 but do not distinguish whether they are investigating the homodimer or monomeric form in subsequent experiments. It would be helpful to clarify which oligomeric state they are investigating in their experiments (DSF, ITC, etc.). See minor point 3. Point 7. D-fucose is smaller and more hydrophobic than BMDG/lactose. It follows that a protein’s binding pocket that is smaller and more hydrophobic (e.g. better packed) will favor D-fucose binding. Given that core packing is a well-established mechanism of protein stabilization (e.g. PMID 27425410), how do the authors think about whether this reflects well established principles in molecular recognition and protein stability vs novel mechanistic insight specific to sugar recognition evolution? Minor points Point 1. Check the Figure 4 legend matches the subpanel letters. E.g. panel “a” shows BMDG not D-fucose. Point 2. IPTG is a synthetic analogue of allolactose and is unlikely to be encountered by evolution in the context of this work. Was this included because it was in the initial carbon source panel? Point 3. Supplementary Figure 6. Only Anc3 and Anc4 appear to have a well defined transition in the CD melt curves. Are the fits to a sigmoidal curve meaningful for the other curves? How were the uncertainties calculated for these fits? Perhaps quote confidence intervals instead of SEM? Point 4. “ᴅ-fucose retains degrees of freedom in the Anc1 binding pocket, contrary to the idea that ligands lose their conformational entropy on binding” How was “degrees of freedom” assessed in this case? Were multiple conformations observed in the electron density maps? Point 5. Ensemble refinement (PMID 23251785) was used to assess protein disorder, however, it is not mentioned in the results text. The Rfree values for the input models to Supplementary Table 5 to help comparison. The Rfree values were up to 5% worse for the ensembles compared to refinement of a single structure (e.g. 21.21 vs 26.21 for the Anc1 glycerol structure). This suggests that the ensemble is worse than a single model. The authors should justify the inclusion of these results. Point 6. The lac operon regulates genes associated with the metabolism of lactose. What did the fuc operon regulate? (Perhaps the genes are hinted at in gray text in Figure 1b?) Point 7. “These findings are suggestive of an evolutionary transition from binding of lactose/BMDG to ᴅ-fucose.” The reverse, right? D-fucose in ancestor, Lactose in extant? Point 8. Figure 2d could be improved by adding the results from all sugars tested with each ancestor. Reviewed by CJ San Felipe, Galen J. Correy & James S.

It's too bad the animals were sacrificed so early because you missed the most important mechanism of harm which is the T-cell attacks. All adverse reactions are immune-mediated on concentrated foci on the endothelium. Once SP production is started, SP peptides are presented on the MHCs for self-monitoring. It typically takes 2-3 days for T-cell specialization after the first injection in a naive individual. I am not sure how fast the boluses were injected. Were they infused slowly over a few minutes? or were they instantaneous bolus? Was that consistent across all pigs? PEG impedes transfection of endothelial cells at first.  As soon as PEG is eroded, typically after the passage in the lungs or sometimes earlier, LNPs are activated.  This gives a little time for dilution to take place. Boluses deliver concentrated transfection across the lungs, the heart chambers, the aorta, the large arteries, and onto the organs' capillaries, with increasing activation, and decreasing concentration. Once T-cells are maturated, they would trigger massive T-cell attacks and literally strip the endothelial layer.  Given your methodology, within a few days, all the pigs injected in IV would have died. Some of the anaphylaxis, necrosis must have been triggered either by LNP clogging once the PEG eroded some capillaries, and creating ischemia, or by by endothelial stress-induced apoptosis, triggered coagulation cascades (hence the thrombocytopenia). It's pretty clear from the IM injections that they all go systemic.  The reason they go systemic is because the needle cuts through vessels, and the Law of pressure gradient stipulates that the dose will inevitably migrate to the point of least pressure i.e. the severed vessels, which won't be able to coagulate until the excess pressure in the muscle evens out.",2025-06-22T14:20:43,marcgirardot,Marc Girardot,10.1101/2025.06.07.658379,Acute anaphylactic and multiorgan inflammatory effects of Comirnaty in pigs: evidence of spike protein mRNA transfection and paralleling inflammatory cytokine upregulation,"László Dézsi, Gábor Kökény, Gábor Szénási, Csaba Révész, Tamás Mészáros, Bálint A.

I have a comment on the methodology that, in my opinion, might affect your results. In previous studies, it has been shown that finger interdependence tends to increase during isometric steady-state force production tasks (e.g., Hirose et al., 2020; Abolins et al., 2020, 2023). In your analysis, the time window used to calculate forces appears to vary from trial to trial. This variability may affect the assessment of interdependence and related force measures. Have you examined whether finger interdependence changes over time in your data? I believe this would be an important point to consider when interpreting your findings.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.638932v1#comment-6721569675,biorxivstage,1,"Dear authors, as part of a group activity in our lab we discussed your very interesting manuscript with the goal of reviewing it as well as improving our reviewing skills. The below review is the result of this exercise and reflects thoughts and comments of several people. We hope this helps you with your way forward to publish the paper in a good journal. Summary, strengths and limitations of the paper The manuscript by Lee et al. investigates the mechanisms behind lysosomal damage in CLN4, a form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis caused by dominant mutations in the DNAJC5 gene. The authors demonstrate that CLN4-associated DNAJC5 mutants aggregate on lysosomal membranes, leading to membrane disruption and severe lysosomal damage in neurons derived from human iPSCs and in a Drosophila disease model. In non-neuronal cells, a protective ubiquitin-dependent microautophagy pathway is activated, helping degrade these toxic aggregates and preventing lysotoxicity. Through CRISPR screens, the ubiquitin ligase CHIP (STUB1) was identified as a critical regulator of this pathway. CHIP facilitates the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of CLN4 aggregates, thus preserving lysosomal membrane integrity and preventing the lysosomal-driven cell toxicity. Importantly, overexpression of CHIP in CLN4 mutant neurons and flies restores lysosomal function, reduces lipofuscin accumulation, and rescues neurodegeneration, highlighting CHIP as a potential therapeutic target for CLN4 and, potentially, other lysosome-related neurodegenerative diseases. A strength of this study is its comprehensive mechanistic investigation into CLN4 disease, identifying lysosomal membrane damage as a key pathological feature and clarifying the still open question about how DNAJC5 aggregates cause neurodegeneration. In addition, the identification of the ubiquitin ligase CHIP as a key regulator of a protective microautophagy pathway represents a key discovery. CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of DNAJC5 aggregates enables their lysosomal degradation, effectively preserving lysosomal integrity. These findings are of important translational relevance, since CHIP overexpression restored lysosomal function and reduced neurodegeneration in both human neurons and flies, highlighting a promising therapeutic application. However, the study also displays some limitations. While the neuron-specific vulnerability to CLN4 aggregates is a central focus, the mechanistic basis for this selective sensitivity remains only partially explained. Additionally, the therapeutic relevance of CHIP modulation is based on genetic overexpression, which, while illustrative, does not yet translate to practical interventions such as small molecules or gene therapy strategies. The broad role of CHIP in cellular protein quality control also raises questions about potential off-target effects of systemic modulation. Despite these challenges, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field by establishing a mechanistic link between lysosomal membrane damage and CLN4 pathology and identifying CHIP-mediated microautophagy as a potential neuroprotective pathway. Major Comments 1.	In Figure 1A, why do monomeric DNAJC5 levels change in the mutants? L116ΔHT seems to have comparable levels to WT, which is not the case for the other heterozygous mutant nor for the homozygous of the same mutation. Are the overall DNAJC5 levels changed in the different lines? Maybe testing by qPCR or checking the fully solubilized protein by WB can be options. 2.	In Figure 1D, can the authors prove that the loss of lysotracker signal in day16 neurons is not simply because these cells are dying? Can they stain cells with calcein-AM as well? 3.	In Figure 1L, why do they not find CHIP in the proteome? Based on figure 5A, they should find a difference in its levels between WT and L116Δ HM. Do they check the proteome at a timepoint that is too early, or are CHIP levels overall too low to pick up changes? Minor comment: in the text, they define a log fold change cut-off of 1.5. Please illustrate this in figure 1L. 4.	In Extended Data Figure 2E, where does the HMW form of DNAJC5 fractionate? And does the organelles fraction change in mutants? It would be of help to see the fractionation of the mutant too, showing also the HMW DNAJC5. This will also help to understand why the authors see the downregulation of DNAJC5 in mutants in mass spec (Figure 1L). 5.	The authors show that the lysotracker phenotype in mutants is likely not linked to V-ATPase dysfunction. However, it is not fully clear what is happening to V-ATPase. In Extended Data Figure 3A, the WB shows a decrease in the interaction between mutants FLAG-DNAJC5 and membrane-bound ATP6V1G2. What is the authors’ hypothesis of this phenotype? 6.	In Figure 3, the authors conclude that ubiquitin, HGS and DNAJC5 colocalize on lysosomes. Can they add a lysosomal staining (e.g. LAMP1) to really prove this point and show the lysosomal localisation of mutants? And, more in general, the authors should include a colocalization analysis (e.g. Pearson’s everytime they claim it - Fig. 1H, 3A, 3C, 4F, 4H and 6C). 7.	In Figure 3E,F, it seems that also the monomeric version of DNAJC5 accumulates inside lysosomes and this is impaired when microautophagy is blocked. Can the authors comment and expand in the result section about the WT phenotype? 8.	In Figure 3H,I, the treatment with TAK-243 induces the reduction of lysotracker signal also in cells overexpressing the WT isoform. Why? The authors can include the quantification of untreated cells too. 9.	In Figure 4 (A and B) and Extended data Fig.5, the authors employed CRISPR screens and identified CHIP as a candidate regulator and then they further supported this finding through KO and rescue experiments. The claims they made here can be sufficiently supported by the data they showed. However, one concern  is the noticeable difference between the screening results of the WT and ΔJ conditions, as there are relatively few overlapping hits. What could explain this divergence? How feasible is it to use Keima-DNAJC5 with L116Δ for CRISPR screen instead of using DNAJC5 WT and  ΔJ? Does the Keima-DNAJC5ΔJ mutant have the same aggregation and/or lyso-toxicity phenotype as observed with the L116Δ mutation? Considering that both DNAJC5 WT and the ΔJ mutant are involved in misfolding-associated protein secretion (MAPS) and microautophagy (PMID: 35506243), but the ΔJ mutant lacks MAPS activity, is it appropriate to use the ΔJ mutant as a substitute for the L116Δ mutation? How is this choice justified in the context of the study? 10.	In Figure 4D, is the observed leftward shift, particularly in case of sh-CHIP, substantial enough to confidently conclude that there is a decrease in the association of Keima-DNAJC5 WT with lysosomes? It would strengthen the claim if this was quantitatively assessed and supported by statistical analysis. 11.	In Figure 4E, we would expect similar immunoprecipitation efficiency for all FLAG-tagged proteins using FLAG beads. The recruitment of the various FLAG-DNAJC5 constructs to the beads should be comparable—consistent with what is shown for FLAG-DNAJC5 WT, L115R, and L116Δ—in order to confidently conclude that the co-immunoprecipitation demonstrates CHIP can bind both WT DNAJC5 and the CLN4 mutants independently of the J domain. Alternatively, if transfection efficiency or expression levels of FLAG-DNAJC5 ΔJ present an issue, the protein level of FLAG-DNAJC5 ΔJ in the input should be provided to clarify this point. 12.	In Figure 4F, from the representative confocal images, Ci-L116∆ mutant in CHIP-KO appears to be localized also on cell periphery or boundary along with punctate localization. Also, it would be better to show the status of ubiquitin and HGS staining in CHIP’KO cells without any over-expression of CLN4 mutants to appreciate the role of CHIP in microautophagy of CLN4 mutants. 13.	In Figure 4G, I and K, the figure legends for the graphs do not clarify how the normalization of the Ub and HGS areas was done with respect to their untransfected (UT) cells. Did the authors use neighbouring untransfected cells from the same coverslip or did they use a common untransfected control for all the samples? Also, it would be more informative to add the untransfected column in the graphs shown in Fig. 4G and Fig.4I, similar to Fig.4K, to have a better comparison in the data. 14.	In Figure 5, the overall rescue effect of CHIP in this system is weak. Maybe the fact that their promoter only activates from d8 onwards is part of the problem? Would it be possible to start expressing CHIP earlier? 15.	In Figure 5A, the authors overinterpret their results and claim from only the fact that CHIP is in the NP40-insoluble fraction that it must be inactive. Could they check whether it really ends up in the HMW L116Δ aggregates, and maybe even perform an in vitro assay to determine its activity in either version? 16.	In Figure 5G, the authors show increased cell death in immature neurons which lack the lysosomal damage phenotype. What is the authors’ explanation for this phenotype? Is it linked to CHIP aggregates accumulation? 17.	In Figure 6, how do the different levels of lysosomal translocation make sense with their model? Shouldn’t the brain have the lowest level of translocation, since this is the only tissue where a phenotype occurs? 18.	We would recommend moving Figure 7 to the extended data, and spend more time in the text to explain the relevance of Tsg101. Currently the figure comes a bit unexpected and does not allow the authors a strong finish to the paper, since the phenotypes are less convincing than the ones in Figure 6. In addition, is there any quantitative analysis of the rough eye phenotype that can give a more objective assessment for the phenotype? Minor comments ●	In Figure 2F, the authors should also show the WT DNAJC5-treated cells. It will make the data more complete and solid, confirming that the WT isoform is not interfering with lysosomal homeostasis. ●	In Figure 2H, in the L116Δmono panel a control cell (intact) is missing. ●	There are no supporting images for Figure 5H (also not in extended figure). ●	In Extended Figure 6B and C, why does the WT go down too? Showing the graph like this is a little confusing, and also the normalisation.. and they should add also earlier time point to see if at d12 something is happening ●	Try to avoid using red-green as a combination in figures, to make the paper accessible to colorblind people. ●	Authors can homogenize how they show statistics in their graphs, either deciding to not show the p-value when it is not significant or to include it every time. Also, why do they often use n=2 and do statistics on individual data points? Why not add n=3 and do statistics on experiments? ●	The authors claim a microautophagy-based system that cleans up the DNAJC5 aggregates, which end up inside lysosomes. However, if the aggregates can damage the lysosome membrane from outside, why would they not do the same from the inside?",2025-06-13T13:20:50,,Anonymous,10.1101/2025.02.18.638932,CHIP protects lysosomes from CLN4 mutant-induced membrane damages,"Juhyung Lee, Jizhong Zou, Wan Nur Atiqah Binti Mazli, Natalie Chin, Michal Jarnik, Layla Saidi, Yue Xu, John Replogle, Michael Ward, Juan Bonifacino, Wei Zheng, Ling Hao, Yihong Ye",2025-02-19

Your findings and conclusions align very closely with our observations on iORFs in the model plant Medicago truncatula. It would be interesting to consider one more scenario. What if an amino acid sequence encoded by an iORF becomes part of a long alternative splicing form of a canonical protein instead of or in parallel with acting as a microprotein? Suppose such a form provides a biological advantage regardless of its origin. In that case, the iORF region may be conserved strongly at the amino acid level in the alternative frame but much less in the reference frame. In other words, alternative splicing may probably explore and utilize the coding potential of alternative frames even without the production of a microprotein. In both scenarios, mutations neutral for one splicing form may be affecting the amino acid sequence of a different splicing form. This would be one more reason to consider such mutations in many contexts, primarily in studies aimed at the identification of the molecular basis of genetic diseases and acquired cancer types. Unfortunately, such mutations are still being ignored in most studies. Your work will undoubtedly contribute to changing this state of things in the future.

I’m glad to see the work being discussed! ## Question 1: applicability to other brain regions. Great question. Applying the same confidence bands to the VTA LR model predictions on the NAc excludes 3.53% and 9.24% for the narrow and wide bands, respectively. Accuracy for remaining classifications then improves from 91.8% at baseline to 93.3% with the narrow band and 95.8% for the wide band. This result is similar to the results for the VTA data and would suggest that they are useful when making predictions in another brain region. However, it would be prudent to note that the distribution of incorrect predictions was slightly right-shifted in the NAc data compared to the VTA data. As long as the distribution of predictions is largely dichotomous, I would feel comfortable applying the same decision thresholding strategy in another brain region. However, if the distribution of predictions is different enough, it may be worth considering a different approach. ## Question 2: code Thanks for checking out the GitHub repository! I've updated the repository to 1) ensure the code matches version 2 of the pre-print, and 2) to include the pre-trained models. The LR model is a standard glm object; the other models are caret objects. You can find the methods for applying the models to new data within the HTML, Qmd, and stand-alone evaluation scripts in the `code/` directory. The most finicky part is formatting the new data to match the predictor variables used to train the model, as sometimes R likes to convert characters in gene column names. In applying these to our latest data, we’ve also found that the set of detected genes can differ slightly from the training data. If you have any issues with this, please feel free to reach out, and we can help troubleshoot. I would love to wrap these functions into a package, but I haven't had the time yet. I have made some toy packages with biocthis before (it's fantastic, thank you!), but nothing that has made its way to Bioconductor yet. If we can get these functions into a better form for a package, I will certainly reach out for any tips you have on the process. It would be a great resource for the community, and I would love to see it in Bioconductor. Thanks again for your interest! If you have any more questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.

Below is a collection of the comments made by the various group members: --- 1 --- It's unclear why asymmetry in the latent embeddings is required. No mention of the model predicting trivial results during training due to the symmetric KL? Ablation might reveal that the loss weights require very careful tuning to avoid predictions or that the reference distribution is extremely important. There are a number of implicit assumptions being made with the model architecture, primarily that there is sufficient information to align two datasets. It becomes an issue when combining datasets from very different modalities (e.g. scRNA-seq and sc proteomics). Adding multiple modalities is definitely possible, but the overlapping information becomes smaller and lose additional information. It would be good to see where the model stops working. Small datasets will similarly carry little information: is there a minimum number of samples for the model to function as expected (exact number not required, but getting a sense with a few datasets of different modalities would be informative). As-is, we wouldn't expect the model to apply to most single-cell datasets. Aligning modalities that are of extremely-different dimensionality implies either redundant information in one modality or information loss. This should be discussed. Specifics of training, hyperparam optimization, etc. would be better in a supplemental (assuming the targeted venue allows it). The main contribution appears to be the combination of the various losses. The article could be shortened by focusing on that when describing the method. Re: training procedure. No mention of balancing the different modalities. ""Difficult"" modalities would be more difficult to learn. early stopping could be preventing complex modalities from being sufficiently mapped because the simpler modalities are overfit faster than the complex ones are learned. Evaluation metrics: NMI is very similar to the symmetric KL that is used to train the model. I'm not sure if it's a reliable metric for this. Fig. 2a: the figure amounts to ""the model removed information,"" which is the point of batch correction but doesn't quantify what other information was lost. Fig. 6 suggests that there is quite a bit of biological information is lost. Fig. 3: scRNA reconstruction is producing high values for some genes when it shouldn't (purple cluster, top). If one were to use this, we would conclude that those genes are highly differentially expressed when they are not in the original data. This is a fatal problem. --- 2 --- 1. Lack of Evaluation in Downstream Biological Applications While UniVI shows strong performance in latent space alignment and cross-modality prediction, its utility in downstream biological tasks (e.g., identifying novel cell subtypes, inferring regulatory programs, or reconstructing differentiation trajectories) remains under explored. Demonstrating improvements in real biological discovery would substantially enhance the manuscript's impact. 2.	Insufficient Validation of Generalizability Across Conditions The datasets used in evaluation are mostly standard and clean (e.g., PBMCs from 10x Genomics). It is unclear whether UniVI generalizes well to more diverse or challenging settings (e.g., different sequencing technologies, species, or tissues). 3.	No Ablation Studies to Justify Model Design The architecture includes several important design choices (e.g., β-VAE, shared and private latent spaces, MoE layers), but the manuscript lacks ablation experiments to validate the contribution of each component. 4.	Lack of Interpretability for Latent Space Representations The latent space is central to UniVI’s function, but its biological interpretability is not addressed. It is unclear which features (genes, peaks, proteins) drive the alignment, or how latent dimensions relate to known biology. 5.	Failure Cases and Limitations Are Not Discussed The manuscript does not address situations where UniVI might fail or yield poor alignments. Understanding when and why the method breaks down would be critical for end users. --- 3 --- 1) They mention that scATAC-seq is not reliable for determining cell type specificity, then why did they necessarily include ATAC-seq? 2) The dataset they use are reliable but I think it would be good for them to mention why exactly they preferred these dataset and databases, there is not much information about this --- 4 --- Figure 4: recommend labeling panels rather than referring to top left, etc. In the boxplots at the top left, uniVI and totalVI seem really similar in NMI, ARI, ACC but no formal statistical comparison done usability may be limited if you have to manually fit the model with your own data is overfitting a problem with very small datasets? is computational time a problem with very large datasets (eg early stopping used)? --- 5 --- -Use of the model to generate new data is stated and referenced throughout, but I felt the true utility of this is underexplored. Why would someone want to do this? The authors mentioned data augmentation, but the authors could be more explicit on any other uses. -Did the authors consider using alternative methods to grid search for their training procedure (e.g., neural architecture search)? Also what were the ranges of values searched and with what step sizes? -For adding >2 modalities, are there any considerations with computational complexity and training time at a certain point? How would this scale to K>2? -In general, the paper is well organized and detailed, but almost to a fault. I suggest moving details less relevant to the average reader into a supplemental section. For example, knowing the function calls and variables probably isn't relevant to most readers. Those that want to know that could look in the code or point the reader to a supplement. These somewhat irrelevant details to the figures were also mixed with critical details such that I felt a little lost on trying to pick out the most important parts of the methods. -On the same note, simple details are often over-explained or restated multiple times in the text (e.g., the explanation for subsetting the data to obtain non-overlapping labels is repeated several times), while more complex concepts such as the Beta term, mixture of experts model, etc. are often underexplained in my opinion. -For Figure 1, I am still confused on what exactly UniVI provides a benefit over in some panels versus just looking at individual UMAPs and annotating by the labels, since these are already known? More specific explanation on why a shared latent space is usual to find new biology would help. -Exploring more on the fringe cases in which data does not align is interesting. For example, the authors mention cell 59 aligning closer to a Dendritic cell than B cell. They mention this could be biological variation or technical error, but exploring more about this 'misalignment' in this and other datasets could be be a key way of identifying unique insights from this model, though would require biological validation. Perhaps the authors could suggest some such experiments as future work to tie in dry and wet lab approaches/experimental designs that would complement this model in the lab. --- 6 --- In the paper authors mention that approximately 1% of the dataset shows inconsistent alignment. Could you elaborate on how this might be interpreted as reflecting dynamic cellular states in continuous development? A deeper discussion of this would be very helpful. --- 7 --- Figure 7: how to prove that the reconstruction retains the biology signal or better illustrate: It’s weird that the error did not increase significantly with the higher dropout rate. As well as for the Correlation When no dropout is applied, the correlation between the raw and reconstructed data is only 0.52. Does this suggest that the pathways have changed significantly? It may be necessary to check which pathways have changed and which have not. --- 8 --- Lack of QC metrics and if there were any filtering involved for the data. Transparency is missing in the QCs. --- 9 --- A limitation is that this must be only used for measurements made from the exact same cells - we cannot apply this framework to cells measured in parallel with different methods Figure 2 not sure that they compared to CCA or OT as those were introduced alternatives in the beginning. Figure 2 : I like that they show the measurement pairs for each cell - can they quantify this globally somehow? The distinction between “imputation” and alternative mode reconstruction is unclear from their description; they mention fitting a gaussian mixture model with their data and then using that for input - does that mean they use the true values from one measurement modality and then use all zeros for the other? Why not simply run a forward pass from the one modality encoder and then use the opposite decoder? They comment on higher expression levels having higher reconstruction MSE - this is a common feature of autoencoders that compress the range of predictions so as to minimize error from any large magnitude predictions. The methods claim to have used pp.scale() which should have removed this effect of the measurements original magnitude? It would be interesting to know what are the limits in terms of minimum (or maximum) features per modality and minimum measurements for training. Based on figure 4, the claim that uniVI “outperforms existing state of the art integration methods does not appear to be statistically supported. It appears to be indistinguishable from TotalVI and perhaps even Seurat. The authors should compute p values using random samples of the data with replacement (I think these experiments used identical samples, which would violate the assumption of independence for t-testing). TotalVI appears to have been published over 4 years ago in Nature Methods. However they claim that TotalVI requires “modality specific priors”. This “prior” appears to be a specific model term that is learned from the data to account for background, so I agree that uniVI is more generalized but not by as much as I thought before seeing this prior work. The authors should be careful about statements of distance based on UMAP “The model preserved meaningful cellular distinctions, with closely related populations remaining spatially proximate in the latent space, underscoring UniVI’s ability to harmonize intra-modality variation while retaining biologically relevant structure.” Figure 6C is a neat application of this data. Does this scale beyond this data and how can it be less slushy in the representations? Can this be fit on very deep single cell omic data and then applied to predict missing depth from more shallow studies? It would be interesting to repeat the dropout experiment with multiple random dropouts to get a sense of variance in the genes that are dropped out. I’m confused why the pre and post reconstruction heatmaps in figure 7 bear no resemblance even with 0% dropout. Are these hierarchically clustered differently or should we be able to compare the shapes between them. Is there overlapping information between true SCP and SCT (beyond cite-seq where the proteomic measurement part is substantially limited based on the number of antibodies)? Does this work well beyond measurements from blood cells (what seems like an easy case)? --- 10 --- I was hoping to see more of the unified cell state concept play out in its experiments. I feel like they got sidetracked (or rather, realized they didn’t have enough to really fulfill that ambition), but it would be nice to have that addressed more clearly. I was wondering if weights trained for a single modality as paired to a second modality could be transferred to a third modality comparison. Doubtful, but it would be interesting to explore. Not sure if this is something that you actually want to include in the review. It was more what I was focusing on and was somewhat dissatisfied by. The text in the figures is too small to read, generally speaking. I found issues with all figures with the possible exception of the first. Figure 1b, Cell-Cell Alignment is not intuitive. It goes from a UMAP to decode as a graph figure, and is not consistent with the batch correction element of the same subfigure. It’s an odd inconsistency.",2025-06-02T17:22:57,karlmilcik,Karl Milcik,10.1101/2025.02.28.640429,Unifying Multimodal Single-Cell Data Using a Mixture of Experts β-Variational Autoencoder-Based Framework,"Andrew J.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.23.644840v2#comment-6714181012,biorxivstage,1,"Hi! Very cool and interesting work, I really appreciate the amount of work you put into it. I have a question about your ITC data. From the methods section, it seems you only obtained thermodynamic binding data at 25C. Have you considered determining the relationship of dH with temperature -- the heat capacity of binding? If the dCp is negative then the reaction becomes more enthalpically-favorable as temperature increases (and, by compensation, the entropic contribution becomes more unfavorable). Since environmental temperatures at ancient times were higher (which matches with the observation of increased Tm in Anc1 and Anc2), it's possible that the binding reaction to BMDG/fucose is also driven by enthalpy at higher temperatures (which would be the normal temperatures experienced by the TFs at the time). Of course, this would be highly dependent on the magnitude of dCp. Making this characterization would be a very useful because it could strengthen your main argument about enthalpy-entropy trade-offs or it could even suggest that an enthalpy-driven mechanism was conserved over time, which it's also very cool and interesting. I recommend reading Cooper, A. (2005). Heat capacity effects in protein folding and ligand binding. Biophys Chem 115(2-3): 89-97 and related literature to evaluate if my comment makes sense.

Still i don't like dogmatic statements like that you ""overturn decades of animal and human research"", particularly as part of these studies revealed 'real' neural activity and receptive fields with neurophysiology rather than fMRI. What you probably show is that the mapping between SI and higher cortical areas remains stable resulting in a stable top-down induced SI map. (I would not expect that these top-down structural or functional connections change.) This might be as correct as findings by others that the bottom-up sensory driven map changes drastically. The mismatch between both is a reason for phantom sensations and pain and, as previously shown, could be overcome by the use of myoelectric prostheses or sensory re-training. What I am missing is the all-or-nothing maps for the pre-amputation sessions for comparison. Another question: what exactly is the tapping task:  do they 'tap' against an object or their palm (resulting in a 'sensory' phantom stimulation) or is it a pure motor task? The final question to all of us should not be: ""Which findings and conclusions are correct?"" but ""How can we integrate your and previous findings in a joint and coherent model of functional cortical organization and plasticity?""",2025-05-28T09:37:08,neurolabjacobs,NeuroLab@CU,10.1101/2023.12.13.571314,Stable Cortical Body Maps Before and After Arm Amputation,"Hunter R.

But succinate does not have the capacity to succinylate, succinyl-CoA does. Succinate and succinyl-CoA are in equilibrium through succinyl-CoA ligase, and as I saw in their slides that they are able to knock-down (or knock out) both isoforms (ATP- and GTP-  isoforms of succinyl-CoA ligase) by knocking down or out SUCLG1, the common subunit. A lot of succinate, means a lot of succinyl-CoA through reverse operation of succinyl-CoA ligase.
