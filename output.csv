The current study investigates the mechanisms by which plasmids can be transiently maintained, in the presence of targeting by a CRISPR-Cas system. The paper supports the idea that the plasmid and intact CRISPR-Cas system are not compatible within a single bacterium, and identifies loss of CRISPR spacers and mutations in cas9 as mechanisms that facilitate plasmid retention. The experiments in this paper are straightforward and the conclusions drawn are well supported by the data. Some more description of the WT1 population would be helpful. Also, we found the format of Figure 2 to be confusing, and we suggest a simpler representation that focuses on the specific spacers that are lost rather than the order of spacers in the CRISPR array. Lastly, the discussion does not compare the mechanisms described here with those observed in previous studies looking at bacteria with self-targeting spacers. Major comments 1. It is unclear which genetic changes in the WT1 population lead to plasmid retention. The authors should discuss this in more detail. 2. The layout of Figure 2 is difficult to understand, for three reasons. First, the way the data are represented is not clearly explained in the Figure. If the authors choose to keep Figure 2 as a main figure, we recommend adding Figure S3 as a panel in Figure 2. Second, as the authors discuss, there are weaknesses associated with using p-values rather than simple abundance (i.e., Figure S4). The abundance numbers appear to tell the full story. Third, the authors do not explain why the order of spacers in the array is important, as opposed to the presence/absence of specific spacers. We suggest showing only the frequency of detection for individual spacers, rather than spacer pairs. 3. The authors do not compare the mechanisms discovered here to those described in previous studies that look at self-targeting spacers. We suggest including PMID 23637624 in that discussion as well as the authors’ own work. Minor comments 1. In Figure 1a, we suggest showing individual lines for each of the populations, rather than averaging five of them. 2.

In this study, they investigate the significance of type 2 immunity as a means of protecting the host against pathogenic helminths. On the other hand, pathologic type 2 immune responses are responsible for the development and maintenance of allergic diseases. In order to facilitate the creation of efficient methods for avoiding or treating these very widespread illnesses, it is vital to decipher the mechanisms that guide type 2 immunity. In mucosal tissues, type 2 responses are responsible for regulating allergic reactions and immunity to helminths. However, the processes that govern these cells are not well known, despite the fact that tuft cells are critical immune system regulators for type 2 immunity. This study investigates the mechanism by which intestinal tuft cells are diminished by commensal bacteria that produce butyrate. Butyrate's ability to inhibit tuft cells required the presence of the epigenetic enzyme known as histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). This finding suggests that HDAC3 may play a role in the promotion of tuft cell-dependent immunity. Epithelial-intrinsic HDAC3 actively controlled the growth of tuft cells in vivo and was required for the induction of type 2 immune responses after helminth infection. Curiously, butyrate blocked stem cell differentiation into tuft cells epigenetically, and inhibition of HDAC3 was sufficient to suppress tuft cell proliferation in adult mice and human intestinal organoids. Both of these findings are intriguing. These findings show a novel level of control that commensal bacteria use to calibrate intestinal immunity and disclose an epigenetic route in stem cells that governs tuft cell development. In addition, these findings shed information on how stem cells regulate tuft cell differentiation. It has been shown that the composition of microbiota is linked to the onset of a variety of chronic inflammatory illnesses, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, and allergic rhinitis. According to the data provided in the research, commensal bacterial-derived metabolites play an important role in epigenetically regulating type 2 intestinal immune responses through active regulation of tuft cell growth. The studies that are being addressed here have shed light on the significance of this function for metabolites that are generated from commensal bacteria. These cells are to blame for the increased sensitivity in the airways, and they can be discovered elsewhere in the body. It is noteworthy to note that HDAC3 is expressed everywhere, and that the levels of butyrate in extraintestinal areas mirror the bacterial colonization of those regions. Both of these facts are related to the fact that HDAC3 is expressed everywhere. As a consequence of this, it is not inconceivable that butyrate manipulation of HDAC3 may potentially alter immunological responses that are dependent on tuft cells in distant tissue areas. As a consequence of this, it is possible that treating pathologic inflammation throughout mucosal tissues using treatments that include modulating this system using pharmacological agents, methods based on nutrition, or ways based on microbiota might be useful. Using a variety of research approaches and points of view, such as mouse models, human biopsies, organoids, and the interactions of microbiota, this work investigates the linkages between tuft cells and expands our understanding of the influence that microbiota have, which is currently understudied, on type 2 immunology. Positive feedback. I truly appreciate how in-depth the research was, as well as how well-written the paper itself was. In addition to doing research on tuft cells in mouse models, the researchers investigated the formation of human tuft cells in connection to butyrate. They also investigated the microbiome for polymicrobial interactions and biochemistry. The outcomes of the investigation were supported by a wealth of information and high-quality microscopy in the aforementioned study. Employing this helminth was a brilliant choice, in my opinion, given that Nippostrongylus brasiliensis normally colonized rodents as a host organism. I had never heard of using organoids in tuft cell studies before, so I thought it was a really novel approach. It was quite intriguing to see how the findings from mice applied to human organoid samples. Things to Possibly Consider The use of butyrate for therapy is not clearly explained. Is it concentration-dependent? The immune response is not well understood. ILC2 (frequency) is the only measurement available, although it is not a reliable indicator of immunological response. What about the IgE reaction after worm infection? the Th2 cytokines? actual (as opposed to merely their frequency) It would be interesting to look at the immune response's effectiveness under various settings in the mouse model. It's wonderful to see how HDAC3 affects the animals with a deficiency. I do, however, wonder whether there is an additional method, such as using drugs. Perhaps this additional experiment could offer more  that additional evidence that HDAC3 is crucial to the mentioned events. There are inadequate controls in F. prausnitzii recolonization trials. For instance, a control using bacteria that do not produce butyrate as well as bacteria that have been destroyed would be valuable. A better data display is required. Please consider displaying data from individual mice on barcharts. Bar charts are no longer advised for use in scientific articles. Analysis of imaging data and how many tuft cells are detected per 1) unit area, or per 2) nucleated cell, must be done in addition to flow cytometry data. The number of cells in the entire tissue might then be extrapolated using this information. There are no examples of gating strategies for identifying cells (like ILC2s) in the whole study. Without them, it is impossible to determine if the percentages depicted in the numbers are accurate. Additionally, displayed flow cytometry plots (like Fig. 1B) should reflect the percentage of cells in each individual gate. There is insufficient evidence to prove that the Cre mice are true knockouts rather than knockdowns with a phenotypic. What takes place after eggs have been expelled for a period of more than ten days (Fig. 3E)? Is there a relationship between having poor control and having a low IgE response? Low numbers of eosinophils being recruited? It is likely that butyrate has more than one use. What evidence do we have that the key factor impacting HDAC3 expression actually does exist? What additional possibilities are there to consider? What consequences does the absence of HDAC3 in the gut have for macrophages, DCs, and neutrophils that have been recruited in response to an infection? This has to be broken down much more. During the course of a normal illness, does the amount of butyrate in the body change? It would be helpful to illustrate the variation in the datasets using barcharts that contain data points for each individual mouse. There is a possibility that organizing with many figures will be beneficial. For example, Figure 1 depicts three independent tests that are now being conducted. There is some ambiguity about the keys in Figure 2. It's possible that matching color to solid/empty will result in a more accurate translation of the information. Never brought up the L stage, which is important for when the worms were put subcutaneously if you can help it. Could include a life cycle to highlight the movement of the worm as well as the stage at when mice were initially exposed to it. If mice don't cough, how are the worms supposed to get out of the lungs and into the stomach? What was the purpose of the K9 exercise in figure 6? Please explain the reasoning behind your decision. Describe the steps that you take. Why was the promoter looked into only? 16S sequencing is not shown by the numbers, despite the fact that it is specified. Why stop at sequencing the 16S region when we could do the full genome? You should be able to demonstrate that levels of butyrate fluctuate or shift during an infection with helminths. Did not investigate how common HDAC3 was in the population. What kind of an effect did the Cre knockout have on the mouse?

All from one site or geographically spread out?  Seems to me that without broad sampling across each basin and larger sample sizes that it is difficult to exclude the possibilities that rare alleles present in translocated fish have not been picked up in their source populations (thus they appear to be endemic to other rivers).  For instance, if translocated fish into a new river were sourced from Tinana Creek, and you ran this analysis without having sampled Tinana Creek you would conclude the population in that new river had lots of endemic alleles and represents an original population, not a translocated one simply because you hadn't sampled the source or close to the source population.  It would seem very simple for ""endemic"" alleles to be from the Mary River and simply either been lost today due to species decline, or just not sampled in the current study.  What are the frequency of these ""endemic"" alleles in the Brisbane and Pine rivers?  While the Pine River results are potentially harder to explain, to call the Brisbane results as being evidence for an original population seems rather weak.  Why would lungfish be so rare in the Brisbane originally compared to today when there are 10s of thousands of them present after only a few generations?  Also, your suggestion of not mixing these populations because you assume they are locally adapted is not what many conservation biologists advocate today, where mixing across populations is usually recommended and has shown success, at least in Macquarie Perch.  There is no direct evidence for local adaptation and all of the rivers are from a similar climatic region.  Fish from the Mary River have done fantastically well in the Brisbane River, so clearly any local adaptation to their old habitat has not stopped them from doing really well in their new different habitat.",2023-04-11T08:41:06,peterunmack,Peter Unmack,10.1101/2023.03.24.533984,Unravelling the mystery of endemic versus translocated populations of the endangered Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri),"Roberto Biello, Silvia Ghirotto, Daniel J.

However, I'd like to see you address a couple of technical issues and perhaps one theoretical issue in the final manuscript: - the output you posted shows some unusual results, which are potentially false positives that appear to be concentrated among the shotgun and noUDG samples. I'm guessing that this is due to the same types of ancient DNA damage creating IBD-like patterns in these samples. If so, isn't there a risk that many or even most of the individuals in your analysis are affected by this problem to some degree, which might be skewing your estimates of genealogical relatedness between them? - many individuals from groups that have experienced founder effects, such as Ashkenazi Jews, appear to be close genetic cousins, even though they're not genealogical cousins. Basically, the reason for this is a reduction in haplotype diversity in such populations. Have you considered the possibility that at least some of the close relationships that you're seeing between individuals and populations might be exaggerated by founder effects? - thanks to ancient DNA we've learned that the Yamnaya phenomenon isn't just an archeological horizon but also a closely related and genetically very similar group of people. Indeed, in my mind, ancient DNA has helped to redefine the Yamnaya concept, with Y-chromosome haplogroup R1b-Z2103 now being one of the key traits of the Yamnaya identity. So considering that the Corded Ware people are not rich in R1b-Z2103, and even the earliest Corded Ware individuals are somewhat different from the Yamnaya people in terms of genome-wide genetic structure, it doesn't seem right to keep claiming that the Corded Ware population is derived from Yamnaya. Indeed, I can't see anything in your IBD data that would preclude the idea that the Corded Ware and Yamnaya peoples were different populations derived from the same as yet unsampled pre-Yamnaya/post-Sredny steppe group.",2023-04-08T12:17:32,disqus_Og9I1KoklL,Davidski,10.1101/2023.03.08.531671,ancIBD - Screening for identity by descent segments in human ancient DNA,"Harald Ringbauer, Yilei Huang, Ali Akbari, Swapan Mallick, Nick Patterson, David Reich",2023-03-09

First, LMetalSite is a binding site detection method, which is not designed for binding protein identification. Most methods in this field are only trained on binding proteins. If the authors want to use LMetalSite to distinguish binding vs. non-binding proteins, they should re-design the output scores, just like [PepNN Commun Biol 2022]. However, they did not mention any details about how to convert the residue-level predictions by LMetalSite into protein-level predictions. Second, the datasets of LMetalSite removed redundant sequences sharing identity >25% over 30% alignment coverage, which is a strict and common threshold used in this community. The new datasets in M-Ionic collected sequences with no more than 20% identity, which is similar to LMetalSite. However, M-Ionic used a loose threshold for the alignment coverage (90%). Besides, the negative set collected by the authors only removed redundant sequences sharing 100% identity, which might be another potential problem.",2023-04-08T05:50:30,disqus_nGLtVfQB7S,Qianmu Yuan,10.1101/2023.04.06.535847,M-Ionic: Prediction of metal ion binding sites from sequence using residue embeddings,"Aditi Shenoy, Yogesh Kalakoti, Durai Sundar, Arne Elofsson",2023-04-06

Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) is a widely used animal model for understanding the pathogenesis of its’ human counterpart, Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). To initiate a productive infection the virus must first gain access to a host cell. MCMV has various glycoproteins on its surface that interact with specific host cellular receptors depending on cell type. It was recently shown that Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) is important for MCMV entry into a variety of cell types. Depending on the cell type MCMV utilizes different viral glycoproteins to attach and enter host cells. In fibroblasts, viral entry favors the utilization of viral glycoproteins gB in conjunction with gH/gL/gO known as the trimer. In endothelial, epithelial or myeloid cells, viral entry occurs through the use of gB, the trimer and another complex made up of gH/gL/gO/Mck2 which is known as the pentamer. Mck2 or mouse chemokine 2, has dual functionality in both viral entry and chemokine function. Currently it has not been elucidated the host cellular receptor that Mck2 utilizes for entry into host cells. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 screen, this study identifies the MHC-I molecule is implicated in MCK2 dependent entry into macrophages. Positive feedback. I felt that the way the paper is organized was logical and easy to follow. The color coding of the different viruses helped to follow along in the graphs. In the in vivo experiments, utilizing both plaque assays and fluorescence levels to confirm results made them more convincing. The restoration of the phenotype by complementation of B2m and CD81 made the results more convincing. Utilizing the two different viruses that either have or lack MCK2 definitely strengthens their argument.  In examining the B2m relationship with Mck2, performing the experiments both in primary cells and immortalized cells strengthens the argument. Using different virus strains that have different genetic manipulations of MCK2, is beneficial for showing that the phenotype is due to a defective protein and not just that specific mutation of the protein in that virus strain. Major Concerns Given that most of the initial experiments are done in cell culture, I would have expected there to be more replicates. Also why there are different numbers of replicates used between the different virus groups? Characterizing stromal cells as anything not Cd11c positive is a reach. The lack of substantial infectivity of these viruses, regardless of the presence of MCK2, in most of these cell lines makes the data hard to believe I wonder if the current in vivo data can truly tell if lack of H-2 molecules impacts dissemination. Alternatively, it could impact the rate of virus growth in the SG or in other tissues. To truly understand whether dissemination is impacted one must use barcoded viruses. Minor concerns While infectivity using these reporter viruses has been assessed by flow cytometry previously, I think that performing a plaque assay would further validate results. List the actual p values instead of using the star annotation Minor spelling errors (pg. 25 the strain C57BL/6 is spelled incorrectly) For Figure 4 C-E, it would be helpful to make the scales on each of the graphs the same to be able to compare between all three graphs. For Figure 5D, it would be beneficial to show the isotype control in the same panel as the MHC-1 to confirm increase/decrease of expression For those not in the field, I felt that there was not enough emphasis on what type of cellular entry MCK2 functions in, which would help the reader get a more complete understanding of the results. For figure 7, it would be more convincing that the viruses lacking MCK2 are in stromal cells if there was a specific marker used for stromal cells For figure 3C, it is a little unclear what the middle column is demonstrating if it is either a locus or reference sequence. This could be easily clarified in the figure legend or materials/methods section. In page 5 of the results, when talking about the defective MCK2 and how it was repaired, it would be helpful to make it more clear to the reader for how it was defective and how it was repaired. Why was the viral load in SG measured at day 7? What if a later time point (e.g., day 14) viral load is the same for two types of the viruses? This needs to be checked. Which specific H-2 molecules (L,D,K) are important for infection? This could be an interesting point of discussion. b2M-deficient mice may have weird NK cell response that could play a role in control of MCMV. Can the authors confirm that NK cells were not involved in viral control in these mice? In experiments even with MOI=1 infection rate is very low, <20%. Why? Would waiting for longer time to detect infected cells allow detecting all cells as infected?",2023-04-05T15:39:35,,UTK Micro Immunology JC,10.1101/2022.10.05.510922,MHC class Ia molecules facilitate MCK2-dependent MCMV infection of macrophages and virus dissemination to the salivary gland,"Berislav Bošnjak, Elisa Henze, Yvonne Lueder, Kim Thi Hoang Do, Alaleh Rezalofti, Christiane Ritter, Anja Schimrock, Stefanie Willenzon, Hristo Georgiev, Lea Fritz, Melanie Galla, Karen Wagner, Martin Messerle, Reinhold Förster",2022-10-07

Though much focus is centered on thin-film freezing and nanotechnology, why has metabolism of niclosamide by cytochrome P450  CYP1A2 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A1 drawn so little attention? Is it possible after the gut metabolizes niclosamide, what little remains fortuitously interacts with the tape worm but is rendered barely absorbable systemically?  Consider what might be gained if this drug’s p.o. administration was preceded by - or combined - with known CYP/UGT inhibitors such as fluvoxamine, cimetidine, melatonin, ciprofloxacin, acetacin and kaempferol.  Could a more therapeutic blood level be attained? Approaching this dilemma from a different direction, might niclosamide be delivered via suppository, with an increase in its bioavailability?  Many drugs with similar insolubility and molecular weight are already administered rectally with resulting serum levels as effective as pills or capsules.

We know that central tolerance – removal of T cells specific to self antigens – is not 100% efficient and some self-reactive T cells do accumulate in the periphery. This leaky process is likely responsible for some autoimmune reaction observed in humans. However, how such self-reactive T cells are activated remains poorly defined. The authors developed an interesting system where they have T cells recognizing a specific antigen that was engineered to be expressed in lung epithelial cells (OVA + 2W + gp66). By using the antigen with several epitopes this allows to investigate how T cell response to one of these epitopes impacts endogenous immune response to other epitopes. Interestingly, authors found that transfer of T cells specific to gp66 epitope into mice does not result in inflammatory response to 2W epitope by endogenous, 2W-specific CD4 T cells. Instead, the authors observed expansion of 2W-specific Tregs. Response was different in the lymph vs. lung. Interestingly, after primary response, immunization with 2W peptide with an adjuvant did not result in expansion of conventional, 2W-specific T cells indicating induction of tolerance. Expansion of 2W-specific Tregs was also observed by intranasal inoculation of LPS into mice. Overall, this study provides an interesting view on how ongoing immune response may influence response of self-specific CD4 T cells. Positive feedback. There are a lot of interesting things about this paper. First, the system to have lung-restricted antigen that has several well defined epitopes is highly innovative. The methodology to accurately count the number of naive T cells in the whole mouse (we talk about 10-100 cells per mouse!) is impressive. Looking at endogenous response, without transfer of monoclonal TCR-Tg T cells is really fundamental. The way how authors look at two tissues - lymphoid (lymph nodes) and lung - is important. The use of LPS injection as a model for lung injury is interesting as it also allows to look at actual pathology (mouse weight) as a medically relevant read-out. The text is short (perhaps in some places too short, see below for comments) and figures are relatively clear (see comments). Having an experimental layout for how the mice were treated, along with what was harvested for each experiment was very useful. Finally, having many different lines of mice is very impressive! Major Concerns I do not understand how transfer of naive T cells results in pathology in the lung (Fig 1 results). Per basics of immunology, 3 signals are needed to activate T cells - i.e., there is a need of inflammation to induce immune response and trafficking to the lung. Perhaps activated T cells were transferred but that was not clear from experimental design in Fig 1. Authors must provide better rationale of how transfer of naive T cells causes IgM in BAL to increase. Tracking immune response of transferred cells (e.g., activation markers, division history by CFSE, cell numbers in LNs/spleen over time) would be needed. Also, it would be very important to perform titration experiments to show how the number of transferred T cells impacts pathology. Similarly, why day 7 was chosen as the point to measure the endogenous response was not clear. While measurements of T cells in lymph nodes and spleen are typically efficient (most cells are recovered), isolation of activated T cells from nonlymphoid tissues, especially the lung is highly inefficient and may be biased (some subsets could be better isolated than others, PMID: 25957682). Confirming the results of Treg bias in lung samples must be done with using microscopy. Furthermore, when T cells are isolated from tissues due to contamination with the blood, cells in the circulation may be detected as in the parenchyma (24385150). Experiments must be repeated to include intravascular staining to separate cells in the blood vs. parenchyma to indicate that Tregs in the lung are in fact in the lung. I found it weird that the authors claim that 2W-specific Tregs are responsible for suppression of endogenous responses to 2W upon antigen+adjuvant injection and yet, depletion of Tregs did not result in a new response. A simpler interpretation is induction of anergy in endogenous T cells upon exposure to Ag in the absence of strong inflammation. Text must be carefully curated to avoid bias towards one favorite explanation. Focus on SLOs and lung is clear but I wonder if using another control peripheral tissue that did not express the antigen could be useful. For example, measuring T cell accumulation in the liver may be a useful control. It was not clear if  expression of OVA is actually restricted to the lung. Perhaps some more thorough analysis of other tissues would be helpful to verify the absence of leakiness of the gene expression. Minor concerns Having numbers for lines in the paper could allow for better referencing to specific statements made in the paper. While for most immunologists Tregs are FoxP3, some younger researchers may not know this. Mentioning that this is how you define Tregs would be useful. Also, assessing the function of these T cells would be useful. Please do not use “ns” or “**” to denote statistical significance. Use actual p values, e.g., p=0.34 or p=0.012. Additionally, indicating fold difference between groups (effect size) could be also useful. In introduction: Whether autoimmune responses are driven by naive T cells or by cross-reactive memory T cells is unclear. Cross-reactivity may be a simpler explanation given that memory T cells may require lower thresholds for activation. Authors should describe better different epitopes used in the construct, e.g., gp66 is from LCMV. Why did authors use gp66-specific CD4 T cells and not OVA-specific OTII cells? Are the results the same is using T cells of a different specificity? Are the detected Tregs derived from the thymus or are these “converted” naive T cells to the Treg phenotype? I don’t think that the current data allow to discriminate between these alternatives. When indicating difference in expansion in the Results section, please indicate how much (how many fold) is that expansion. How is the lung injury by LPS dependent on the LPS dose? Perhaps this needs to be discussed. I wonder that measuring kinetics of response, e.g., before day 7 and after, may be useful. We know that exposure to self antigens typically results in deletion of naive CD8 T cells (10843383) Which specific LNs were isolated? This probably should be listed in materials and methods section. I wonder if plotting some data as paired (e.g., Fig 1 - 2W vs. SMARTA) could reveal some additional information. How were Tr1 cells gated? Some flow cytometry graphs may be useful here (Suppl Fig S2) Suppl Fig 3 would benefit from experimental design panel.",2023-04-01T23:15:29,vitalyvganusov,Vitaly V.

I am a bit confused by the approach for neighborhood definition: if I understand correctly you search for the w vector with the maximum absolute correlation with ∆g, and then you sort the cells along w. But why not instead just sort the cells according to ∆g? 2. If I understand correctly, the neighborhood is strongly driven by the two cells that define the v to which the selected w corresponds. Have you tested the robustness of the results to this choice? How would you go about testing that? For example, what happens if you remove all cells that belong to  the neighborhood defined for g and then run the process again? Are there no DEGs? Or maybe you can find a different neighborhood that represent cells that are affected by the contrasting variable in a different way as compared to the cells in the original neighborhood. 3. According to your understanding/experience what happens in cases where for a specific gene g and a specific contrast, there are two cell populations for which there is differential expression population A includes cells for which the expression increases by a lot and population B includes cells for which the expression increases by a little? What about if the signs are opposite (i.e. expression increases for population A and decreases for population B)? To clarify, when I say population, I am thinking of some cell type/state. 4. I think it would be helpful to explicitly define what does ∆gQg represents. I assume it is the submatrix of ∆ that includes the row corresponding to g and columns representing cells in Q, but (assuming I got it right) in my opinion it would help to be explicit. 5. I think it would be interesting to see the cumulative Z-score curves for a collection of genes (representing neighborhood of a variety of sizes). What is the expectation in terms of the shape of these curves? Are there outlier cases? Is this something that could be used to identify cases in which the defined neighborhood may be suboptimal? 6. More generally I think the paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of approaches to examine the results and identify cases in which the embedding in general and/or specific neighborhoods may be suboptimal.

We have some recommendations to make the manuscript clearer and some questions, which we’d be grateful if you could answer. The results include a wide range of tissues from mice, rats, and humans. At times, it is difficult to follow how many samples (independent people/animals) were used and which data corresponds to which specific sample, this is an issue given that some data are from tissues known to have higher/lower HCD contents e.g., old vs young participants, TI vs TII dominant muscle fibres, and healthy vs diseased populations. As the focus is on characterising HCD content, the exact source used to determine that content is important. For example, human heart values are from patients undergoing heart surgery, it is not clear what pathology these participants had and how that could affect HCD content, or whether contents would differ in compartments other than the right atrial appendage; human adipose tissue are combined values from lean, and obese people undergoing surgery; liver samples are from people with obesity undergoing gastric bypass surgery, it is possible that they also have other pathologies (e.g., NAFLD) here; and kidney samples are from cancer patients undergoing nephropathy, while you mention that tissue was sampled away from the tumor (in cases of cancer), it is possible that the metabolic changes (pH and glycolytic flux) influenced the tissue HCD contents, and it should be clear this values may not represent healthy human kidney values. All participants should be described in full, especially for factors that are known to influence HCD content (sex, age, BMI, disease state/pathology etc.). As well as this, the beta-alanine supplementation dose needs to be made clear, as this will influence tissue and circulating contents. This additional information could either be fully described in the figure legend, or perhaps with a summary table that contains the various populations, characteristics, and the figure that the data corresponds to. Interpretation and conclusions should also reflect the participant characteristics e.g., HCD concentrations reflect tissue from X, Y, Z pathology or population, rather than assuming these are representative of healthy human values. There is a really interesting finding that using a CARNS1 KO tissue matrix leads to much lower HCD estimations than using water. This has implications for all prior HCD content research, and potentially means we need to correct prior estimations for measurement error. An example of this are the data in Fig 1F, where skeletal muscle concentrations are approx. 2 mM w/w, which is substantially lower than prior research, including the current authors own HMRS data. It would be great for the authors to expand on this, explain the method in detail and the importance of using a CARNS1 KO tissue matrix, and how this should influence future work. The line numbers below correspond to the original version of the paper (which has since been updated with a newer version). Some descriptors in the text appear to overstate the corresponding data e.g., lines 89-90 ‘HCD levels were overestimated by 2-3-fold’ – this is true for the rat CNS data, but the human muscle data difference is an approx. 90% increase. Line 124 also states ‘2-fold higher CARNS1 mRNA’ – but the actual difference here is approx. 60-65%. Line 168 ‘no CARNS1 could be detected’ (in non-excitable tissues). The corresponding data in Figure 4, appears to show a CARNS1 protein band in the adipose/kidney tissue lane – of a similar magnitude to the heart tissue lane. Was this below the limit of detection? Further, it appears that there was very little (perhaps insufficient) protein loaded in the heart and adipose tissue lanes. Did you explore whether this was a measurement issue? There are some inconsistencies in the data presented in Figure 7. The percentages reported in panel A do not match the corresponding data e.g., BAL/NAC increases as +97/199%. Panels A and B have 11 carnosine datapoints, whereas panel C has ~42 datapoints. It is unclear why these numbers should differ, as they appear to be from the same samples. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify this disparity. The paper uses the term ‘systematic approach’ and estimates that 99.1% of total HCDs are contained in skeletal muscle. We are unsure the language should be that strident, given the range of tissues measured, the overall small N per population, and that various tissues are from pathological tissues. From the analysis, it would be possible to say that ‘of the tissues measured’… 99.1% of the HCD content was found in skeletal muscle samples. The methods state that the human CNS tissue was from ‘non-demented controls, indicating the absence of neurological and psychiatric disease’ – was absence of disease confirmed from the participant characteristics? If not, then the term ‘non-demented’ may not be indicate of people free from neurological and psychiatric disease. Figure 7. From the methods used (i.e., NAC not labelled), is it possible to determine that this was specifically NAC release/reuptake, or could it be reflective of a general appearance? The discussion mentions ‘there appears to be a relationship between CARNS1 expression and HCD content on a whole-body level… However, the correlation between CARNS1 expression and HCD content was not perfect, suggesting that there might be inter-organ exchange…’ – the statement appears to relate to data from Figure 4, but it is not clear where the statistical analyses of these correlations/relationships are. Did the authors perform these analyses?",2023-03-30T16:05:24,disqus_0MYVPRM3Xm,Joe Matthews,10.1101/2023.02.16.528841,"Extensive profiling of histidine-containing dipeptides reveals species-specific distribution and metabolism in mice, rats and humans","Thibaux Van der Stede, Jan Spaas, Sarah de Jager, Jana De Brandt, Camilla Hansen, Bjarne Vercammen, Siegrid De Baere, Siska Croubels, Ruud Van Thienen, Kenneth Verboven, Dominique Hansen, Thierry Bové, Bruno Lapauw, Charles Van Praet, Karel Decaestecker, Bart Vanaudenaerde, Bert O Eijnde, Lasse Gliemann, Ylva Hellsten, Wim Derave",2023-02-19

The probability of false-positive or false-negative results may be decreased and statistical power may be increased by increasing the sample size. b)	Incorporate extra controls: The study utilized wild-type and knockout mice as controls. Including other control groups, however, such as mice with a heterozygous deletion of the PCYT2 gene or mice with a knockout of a different gene, may be advantageous. This would assist in eliminating any possible confusing effects. c)	The study used mice as a model organism, and it is uncertain whether the results can be generalized to human populations to validate the findings. By examining gene expression patterns in muscle biopsies or carrying out clinical trials with PCYT2 modulators, additional studies could examine the function of PCYT2 in muscle health and aging in human populations. d)	Employ more sophisticated methods for data analysis: The study examined levels of gene and protein expression using Western blotting and qPCR. Yet, further approaches like RNA sequencing, proteomics, or metabolomics may offer a more thorough comprehension of the molecular pathways governing muscle health and aging. e)	Perform functional studies: The study did not look into the underlying mechanisms, despite demonstrating the importance of PCYT2 in muscle health and aging.

The following are suggestions from a group of students from The Sainsbury Laboratory who read and discussed your pre-print with great interest: It would be helpful to provide an explanation for the large variation in quantities of hits for each selected LRR-RLK in Figure 1 and define which species are represented for each LRR-RLK hit from your pipeline for added transparency. Additionally, could the small number of hits found for some LRR-RLKs indicate higher divergence between proteins and thus a difficulty in identifying more members? We were wondering if it makes sense to query the phylogenetically represented database (1K Transcriptomes) with a Hidden Markov Model based on LRR-RLKs from a small subset of species that are not phylogenetically representative. We suggest using ""kinase"" or ""intracellular"" domain instead of ""RLK domain"" in the paper for better clarity. Could you please provide more transparency on how you selected the LRR-RLKs you studied in the paper? Ideally, using members from more than one clade and being clear about clade/subfamily/subclade notation would be beneficial. Additionally, having equal representation from both functional groups (development and defence) would allow presenting a more comprehensive conclusion on the comparison between LRR-RLKs involved in development and defence. Do most genomes have more developmental LRR-RLKs than defence LRR-RLKs? We wanted to know if your hypothesis about the divergent rates between defence and developmental receptors would change if the defence LRR-RLKs bind to ligands that do not quickly evolve since LRR-RLKs including FLS2 and EFR bind to highly conserved epitopes from pathogens, not effectors. The main finding of the paper that there was no significant difference between LRR domain evolution in developmental and defence LRR-RLKs is not well-reflected in the title. Including a discussion of the ligands for each receptor and whether these are present natively in the plant would be useful along with Figure 3. We hope these suggestions are helpful, and we appreciate your effort in advancing the understanding of LRR-RLK evolution.",2023-03-29T17:06:48,tslpreprintgroup,TSL pre-print group,10.1101/2023.03.13.532436,Asymmetric evolution of protein domains in the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) family of plant developmental coordinators,"Jarrett Man, Thomas Harrington, Kyra Lally, Madelaine E.

Except the  attribute given to the causal factors such as feeding, I could not grasp: (a) how and where the authors quantified bioturbation or uprooting effects of foraging cyprinids?; (b) where and how the authors quantified repeated feed application in littoral zone/ bed made them unsuitable for recurrent aquatic macrophyte growth?; (c) what is the redfield ratio of feed input and how it dilutes or upconcentrates the same ratio in littoral bed making them unsuitable?. The authors show nicely temporal trends of littoral machrophyte zone shrinking (OKAY), but do not show direct causal relationship with attributes for which they are blaming the reason (e.g., feeding or no feeding). One can say, the same inference could be drawn for climate change too (perhaps stronger after evaluating a multi-decadal water stress in the territory). If fishpond management is to blame, why chasing feed application alone, when there are bigger causes such as farmers preferring not to keep them as they interfere with netting/ harvesting operations. Why not discuss these? Lastly, an intuitive point to consider, higher the littoral macrophyte vegetation (especially the emergent ones), more intense is the evapotranspiration by the pond body; because there is more surface area which actively evapo-transpires. This is further compounded by water stress (climate change), see the IPCC report published recently. Is not the relationship between shrinkage of littoral vegetation cover and a good littoral vegetative cover, universally juxtaposed forever? As a matter of fact, if recent IPCC report is true, one could question if keeping dense macrophyte beds (littoral) is even reasonable to combat water stress, and not making green belts around the pond instead. Which is efficient and not counter-productive? To conclude, the publication has a strong logic, but it could easily discuss its results on a broader context; instead of localizing its focal point with things that are more socio-politically charged and less of science. I recommend the study to be published; but also request the learned authors (with good legacies of work behind their names) to consider this request.

However, we regret that all previous studies we have published on the same topic (Fournier et al., 2021; Devaux et al., 2021; Colson et al., 2021; Colson et al., 2023) have been ignored here. Practically, France did not implement systematic SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in mink farms during the summer of 2020, despite information circulating at the WHO after information from Holland and Denmark showing that there were SARS-CoV-2 epidemics among farm mink that were transmissible to humans, and then, in a human-to-human manner (Larsen et al., 2021; Oude Munnink et al., 2021). In France, after the first incidence wave, a new rise of incidence was observed during summer 2020 that started in June from Mayenne (in the left upper corner of France), a department where SARS-CoV-2 cases were reported in two slaughterhouses including one in Laval in June 2020 and that is close to the Eure-et-Loir department, where there was the French farm with minks diagnosed SARS-CoV-2-positive mid-November 2020. Interestingly, the re-increase of Covid-19 cases in France was associated with the emergence of a new variant, which we identified in our geographical area and we called ""Marseille 4"" and which was classified in the B.1.160 Pangolin lineage (Fournier et al., 2021). We tried to get access to the SARS-CoV-2 sequences or samples of the mink of the Eure-et-Loir farm, but we could not get them, and the first sequence was published 4 months after the systematic culling of the whole mink reservoir. Our epidemiological hypothesis was that the ""Marseille 4"" epidemic, which predominated and was the most severe between August 2020 and February 2021 in France, had its origin in mink farming, and indeed, the first sequence released showed a perfect similarity with the very many sequences of this variant that we were able to obtain from humans, as we already reported in 3 publications of studies analyzing these sequences (Fournier et al., 2021; Colson et al., 2021). Moreover, a Marseille-4 genome was found in a mink sampled in October 2020 in Italy (Moreno et al., 2022). Our hypothesis is that mink generated a new variant transmissible to humans as in the Netherlands and in Denmark. It is a pity that, in a publication of this nature, all these elements, which have already been published and are on-line, were not integrated into a discussion of the epidemics of SARS-CoV-2 in French mink farms.

Abstract- ….”OGT-KO mice exacerbated DEN-induced HCC developments with increased inflammation, fibrosis, and YAP signaling”  YAP1 is active and localized to nucleus for proliferative activities only in O-GlcNAcylated state, without OGT YAP undergoes phosphorylation and translocation to cytosol for subsequent ubiquitination. 2.	Methods-… “For chronic OGT deletion, two-month-old male OGT-floxed mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with AAV8-TBG-GFP or AAV8-TBG-CRE, and tissues were collected 35 days after AAV8 administration” Here administering AAvs via IP seems out of place, has any reports of its success been documented??? 3.	Results- ….There was no difference in OGT protein levels in healthy, steatosis, and NASH samples, but OGT was completely absent in cirrhosis and HCC samples” the ogt levels seem increased in steatosis and NASH, but glycation is otherwise no conclusive data. •	Western blot analysis was utilized to confirm successful OGT-KO (Fig. 2B).  I can not see significant OGT deletion or global o-glycation. IP ADMINISTRATION OF AAV FAILURE?? •	“Depletion of O-GlcNAcylation promotes diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC”  2 months post OGT deletion is too short duration. •	…..Lastly, we found decrease in phosphorylated LATS and phosphorylated Yap but an increase in total Yap in OGT-KO mice compared to control mice (Fig. 6O). qPCR on YAP target genes (Ctgf and Ankrd1) corroborated the YAP activity data (Fig. 6P). These data indicated that proliferation is governed by YAP signaling…” this statement is contradictory to YAP dynamics it switches between glycated and phosphorylated forms, while phosphorylated form is destined for turning over the glycated one is active and stable. Increase in phosphorylation should relate to opposite of what authors are claiming. 4.	Discussion- •	“The HCC model we implied was only a 7 month after DEN-injections with only 2 month of OGA deletion. This is relatively short to allow HCC to develop.” But the same duration was conclusive enough for authors for after effects of OGT deletion. •	“Two O-GlcNAcylation sites have currently been mapped to YAP, Ser127 and Thr241. Interestingly, one site is thought to inhibit HCC progress (Ser127), while the other enhances disease progression (Thr241). Both modifications act by increasing the translocation and activity of YAP; however, each seems to have a different role. Ser127 leads to increased cell proliferation and survival, whereas Thr241 modification allows YAP to upregulate the transferrin receptor (TFRC), promoting cell death through ferroptosis.” The bold text regarding glycation at Thr241 are contradictory. •	The competition  of YAP/HNF4α for heterodimerization with TEAD4 is also contradictory. While lack of O-GlcNAcylation leads to downregulation of HNF4α, IT DOES SO WITH YAP too. Need satisfactory explanation 5.	Our Conclusion- The study needs thorough revision and validation with satisfactory explanation of the outcomes.",2023-03-22T19:03:10,disqus_7tyB47z6Be,Wasim Khan,10.1101/2023.02.16.528884,The Essential Role of O-GlcNAcylation in Hepatic Differentiation,"Dakota R.

I see that in Cohort #1, you employed largely Mann-Whitney tests implying that your data was nonparametric, however in Cohort #2, you employed parametric tests (Pearson & unpaired t-test) to statistically analyze the data.

Human coronavirus OC43 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus beta-coronavirus within the family Coronaviridae. Research interest in the immunopathology of beta-coronaviruses has increased following the emergence of SARS-Cov-2, the causative agent of the disease COVID-19. OC43 infection generally causes mild respiratory symptoms and is grouped into the broad category of seasonal “common-cold” coronaviruses. However, like SARS-CoV-2, it can also cause more severe symptoms in those that are of older age or immunocompromised. Recent studies have found that T cells directed against seasonal human coronaviruses such as OC43 cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 indicating a potential protective role. Currently, there is still a knowledge gap about the specific immune response elicited by “common-cold” coronaviruses and their potential in offering protective immunity against more pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS. In this study, authors aimed to identify and characterize specific seasonal coronavirus CD4+ T cell epitopes and explore their ability to cross-react with T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2. Utilizing a human embryonic kidney cell line transduced with CIITA, the immunopeptidome presented by MHC classes was identified following OC43 infection. Moreover, the authors identified a total of 83 peptides derived from some of the major structural proteins and enzymes comprising OC43. Expanded T-cell populations in vitro found that CD4+ T cells recognized OC43 viral peptides. Seasonal human coronavirus specific epitopes were also identified along with two SARS-CoV-2 cross reactive CD4 epitopes. Overall, this study provides interesting insight into the immune response to seasonal human coronaviruses and highlights the possible protective role of identified T cell epitopes as a whole. Positive feedback. The use of the ELIspot assay over an ELISA assay served as good experimental advancement since the ELIspot assay can detect protein levels of cytokines with greater sensitivity and provides a quantitative assessment of cell number. The use of MassSpec provided a way of identifying new epitopes since it was an untargeted method. The amount of samples analyzed through this manuscript was quite impressive. The color scheme used for different MHC classes was consistent and helped with clarity of figures. The spacing and flow of panels within each figure was laid out well. Major Concerns The study did address that the human embryonic kidney cell line(HEK-293) is not the natural target of OC43 and therefore not the most physiologically relevant. MRC-5, a lung fibroblast cell line, would be a good candidate as it is a natural target and has been shown to propagate OC43 well. It was mentioned that among the 6 biological replicates, 11-68% of the HEK293 CIITA cells showed expression of OC43 nucleoprotein. This is a rather large variability. More explanation or analysis of what this might mean would be helpful. In Figure 3 E-F, donor consistency varies between peptides. P1 and P6 have the same donor, but P2 only has one of the same donors. P4 has two completely different donors as compared to the rest.  The lowest peptide dose eliciting a positive response will vary across donors. Since donors serum was not available to test for confirmed exposure to OC43 or other seasonal human coronaviruses, a western blot could be performed on PBMCs with an antibody against OC43 Spike protein to confirm exposure. HEK-293 were transduced with CIITA, which was acknowledged to potentially block effects of viral infection. It would have been good to keep a non-transduced line of HEK-293 as a control to better assess the possibility of CIITA counteracting effects. The healthy individuals that the PBMCs were isolated from were not clearly described. This information is said to be in the supplemental figures (not provided though on biorxiv), but it would be helpful to have the age and current health status of the patients described in the text. It would be useful to know the prevalence of the HLAs for identified peptides in the population to determine how relevant these findings are. In figure 3 G, it would be helpful to normalize to cell numbers so that cell death can be accounted for. In figure 3 G, a known stimulus for IFN-y such as PMA would be useful to have as a positive control. Minor concerns It would have been of interest to explain the use of the TCID50 assay over a plaque assay which is the usual gold standard for quantifying infectious virus particles. The layout of the figures was slightly disorganized and not always laid out sequentially. Arranging them horizontally instead of vertically would help with ease of reading. For example, in Figure 1 B-F. Supplemental figure legends were provided, but not the supplementary figures. It was also not clear on where to access them. It would be good to make these more accessible. It would be helpful to briefly describe the significance of CD107a as it will not be familiar to someone who is not an expert. In Figure 3 G, the panel is difficult to read. In Figure 3 E-F, the overall take home message from this data is not well described. In Figure 1, datasets could be evaluated for possible post-translational modifications which may affect binding to MHC I and II. This would be interesting, as some post-translational modifications promote MHC binding (Engelhard VH, Altrich-Vanlith M, Ostankovitch M, Zarling AL.

Specific APC used is not specified in Figure 3 B-C. Antibodies used to detect the proteins produced by MHC-II were specific (HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP), but the antibodies used to detect MHC-1 proteins, HLA-ABC, were not. More explanation as to why this was the case might be helpful. It might be beneficial to explore other types of immune cells other than T cells, such as B cells, as this might greatly expand the scope of the study. This could be addressed in the discussion just to clarify why T cells were chosen specifically. It might be beneficial to refer to the viral peptides presented by MHC-II as something other than natural as it was acknowledged that the expression of MHC-II proteins was enhanced using CIITA.",2023-03-21T20:47:35,,MICR 603 Journal Club,10.1101/2022.12.01.518643,Immunopeptidome profiling of human coronavirus OC43-infected cells identifies CD4 T cell epitopes specific to seasonal coronaviruses or cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2,"Aniuska Becerra-Artiles, Padma P.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.28.529746v1#comment-6139958577,biorxivstage,1,"PTP1b has been an attractive target for drug development due to its essential role in several cellular pathways and diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Focus has been paid to identifying allosteric sites that regulate catalytic activity via altering the dynamics of the active site WPD loop. However, the structural mechanisms underlying the WPD loop opening and closing (which is relatively slow by NMR) remains unclear. In this paper, the authors sought to identify the structural mechanisms underlying PTP1b loop motion by performing long time scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Starting from existing structures with the WPD loop either open or closed, they are able to derive reasonable estimations of the kinetics of loop opening and closing. They address the question of what structural changes need to occur for the loop to remain open or closed as it fluctuates. Using a random forest approach, they narrow their focus down to the PDFG motifs backbone dihedrals as a set of features sufficient for describing and predicting loop movement between states. The major strength of this paper is reducing the WPD loop conformation (including transient states) down to a set of reaction coordinates in the PDFG motif dihedral angles. Based on this minimum set of features, the committor probabilities provide a strong statistical argument for the transition between open, closed, and transient states along the loop trajectory. The major weakness of this paper is that the visualizations describing the PDFG motif switch model are insufficient and confusing and lack an atomic explanation of how these dihedral changes occur in the context of surrounding residues to complement their statistical explanations. This makes it difficult to interpret what the actual transitions look like. We understand that the atomic explanation of this mechanism can be complicated but refer the authors to this paper as an example even though it is a different target and may not be specifically relevant to their work: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go... (Fig 3) The reaction coordinates alone do not provide a clear direction for envisioning future experiments. Given that this motif is conserved (as the authors explained), other PTP members likely have different structural environments surrounding the motif which likely affects kinetic rates and thermodynamics. Major Points: Previous structural studies of PTP’s have identified atypical open loop conformations in GLEPP1, STEP, and Lyp: https://www.sciencedirect.c... Fig 3A. These loops adopt a novel loop conformation that is more open compared to PTP1B. Further, the presence of catalytic water molecules that are tightly bound in closed states and absent in open states have been suggested to play a role in the closing of the WPD loop. Can the authors provide comments on how the PDFG motif factors into the novel open loop conformation (would the motif dihedrals still predict loop states in these family members)? Were water molecules detected in the binding site and do they play a role during loop closure? Is it possible to include within these simulations mixed solvent MD with a PTP1B substrate to explore their roles in the loop transition? “We note that although the PD[F/H]G BLAST search did return matches in other protein families, there was not the structural information corresponding to those matches that would be needed to draw further conclusions on the conformational significance of PD[F/H]G motifs in those families.” - We feel this is a missed opportunity to at least do some exploration and cataloging using the alphafold structures of these other families. The authors describe the backbone dihedrals of the PDFG motif as being sufficient and necessary for predicting WPD loop conformation but do not mention the side chain conformations. We feel that the explanation and visualization of the side chain conformations in both open and closed states is unclear as there is no analysis of how these transitions and conformations affect the populations and rate movement of the loop. What do the rotamer conformations and transitions look like for the PDFG during open, closed, and transient WPD loop states? How do these rotamer conformations affect loop movements and populations within the simulation? It would be insightful if the authors could provide an explanation of the rotamer transitions during loop opening and closing. Understanding these structural changes during substrate binding and catalysis could yield targets for drug development. Minor Points: Supplementary figures S2, S3, S4, and S5 have little to no information to adequately explain what is being illustrated. The authors should be more clear in describing what these figures represent. A description of axes, experimental set up, and legends would be helpful. The observation that loop fluctuations without long term stability unless the PDFG motif switches is reminiscent of the population shuffling model of conformational changes put forward by Colin Smith - https://onlinelibrary.wiley.... Given the previous NMR data on PTP1B, how does this view alter the interpretation away from a strict two state model? “The free energy estimate from these AWE simulations was ΔGclosed-to-open = −2.6 ± 0.1 kcal mol-1, indicating that the transition from closed to open states is spontaneous (Figure 2b), a finding that is again consistent with experimental data” We are a bit confused by the language here: is this a thermodynamic or kinetic argument? Secondarily, how do the populations compare to those derived from NMR? As previously discussed in a twitter thread with the authors, the backbone ramachandran regions of the 1SUG structure (closed WPD loop conformation) is not in a region previously known for kinases. It would be helpful if the authors could provide validation that the backbone ramachandran regions of the WPD loop are in agreement with what is known about kinases states and whether this would affect their interpretations. https://twitter.com/RolandD...",2023-03-17T20:20:35,,CJ San Felipe,10.1101/2023.02.28.529746,A conserved local structural motif controls the kinetics of PTP1B catalysis,"Christine Y.

The novel approach to defining fibrosis in post-MI models is so interesting, and is a great build upon your previous findings. The mathematical modeling of cold vs. hot fibrosis was an impressive approach. A couple comments regarding the experimental approach: 1 - Considering how different myocardial infarction progresses in male and female humans, and how differently each sex responds post-MI, the lack of differentiation between sexes in the murine and porcine models was concerning. All kinds of factors related to sex can influence post-MI condition, and identifying samples by sex may have explained some of the variability (as seen in Figure 2E). 2 - While the GO analysis refinement of the bulk RNA-seq data is intriguing and provokes question of further study, establishing continuity in using scRNA-seq for both the murine and porcine models would have made for a better comparison of the data. 3 - The UMAP in Supplemental Figure 1A shows a much different gene expression profile in the fibroblasts and myofibroblasts at the end of the healing period in comparison with the early healing period. This would suggest that the ending fibroblasts have much a different identity in comparison to the starting ones, and calls into question whether the two populations can be deemed to be the same. Perhaps further study into differential gene expression of these two populations could be beneficial to the project.",2023-03-16T01:54:59,helenthome,HELEN THOME,10.1101/2023.01.01.522422,Circuit to target approach defines an autocrine myofibroblast loop that drives cardiac fibrosis,"Shoval Miyara, Miri Adler, Elad Bassat, Yalin Divinsky, Kfir B.
