https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.07.459259v1#comment-5691029213,biorxivstage,3,"The manuscript reports the result of a survey of authors of preprints posted to bioRxiv in the period November 2013 to December 2018. The survey asked respondents about their motivations for posting preprints -or not- for the papers they published in scientific journals the previous five years. The main additions compared to earlier surveys on the topic relate to the fact that the survey asked for answers according to whether the respondent was a corresponding author or a co-author on the paper(s), and that for the group of respondents who had posted preprints for some papers but not others, the survey asked about any differences between the papers (e.g. on self-reported novelty or quality of the work), to establish whether a selection bias by authors may take place when making decisions on what papers to post as preprints. The results around motivations for posting preprints correlate with the results of earlier surveys: main motivations are quick dissemination of research and increasing awareness of the research. The respondents also reported an expectation that posting the preprint would bring a benefit in terms of online dissemination of the work e.g. via social media. The survey responses according to whether the author acted as corresponding author or not are interesting as they suggest that preprinting decisions are mostly driven by researcher choice: a higher proportion of respondents posted preprints when they acted as corresponding author, compared to a lower proportion when they were a co-author, as this involved less autonomy in decision making. The preprint landscape in the life sciences has changed hugely in the last two years. The survey was carried out in early 2020 for authors who had published a preprint in the 2013-2018 period, and it is likely that many researchers previously not familiar with preprints are now at least aware of this publication model. It would thus not be surprising if trends have evolved since the survey was done, a follow-up survey (as a follow-up study) would be informative and allow for an interesting exploration of trends around motivations and decision making for preprint use in biological sciences. Specific points -------------- I am not sure I agree with the interpretation that the responses displayed in Figure 8 are at odds with each other. Even if an author considers the papers with and without preprint of similar novelty/quality, I do not think it is surprising for them to have an expectation that the preprint may boost attention/citations, for several reasons: prior research has noted an association between having a preprint and levels of attention/citations, the fact that the preprint disseminates the work earlier and thus may start accruing citations earlier, there is a preprint community on Twitter so the author may expect wider dissemination via those community channels. Survey design - It may be interesting to learn more about how the survey was developed? Were the questions chosen according to the authors’ knowledge or were question options from earlier surveys considered? Was the questionnaire pilot tested prior to deploying the survey, and if so, were any changes made to the wording of specific questions? Analysis of free-text comments - Is there some context/justification for having a single coder for the comments? Was the option of additional coders considered to check for any differences between coders/reduce potential bias? I realize the sample size for certain disciplines may be too small but I wondered about some discipline-level analysis for the responses. Different disciplines are at different stages of use and experimentation with preprints so there may be discipline-level differences on whether authors are making choices based on the perceived quality or novelty of their paper. The qualitative comments note that some authors choose to preprint as protection from scooping while others choose not to preprint due to fear of being scooped, I wondered if views here may be driven by discipline-level variation in use of preprints, i.e. if in my discipline preprinting is common, I may be more likely to preprint as a scooping-protection approach than the opposite. This goes beyond the scope of this paper, but may be a follow-up exploration. There is a thorough discussion of the limitations of the survey, a few additional items for consideration: - This is a survey based on self-reported responses, it may be worth noting that there is no stipulated benchmark for quality or novelty, and thus this may introduce nuance or subjectivity in how the question around novelty or quality is interpreted. - The survey was run in March-April 2020, when there were lockdowns in place in different countries, may lockdown measures have affected response rates by certain groups (certain locations, gender) particularly impacted by lockdowns? - It is noted that the survey is focused on a single preprint server, there are different preprint servers for biological sciences, it may also be relevant in the future to explore comparisons across servers for biology. Even within biological sciences there may be differences between authors who post to preprint servers directly, and those who post preprints via deposition offered by publishers at the stage of journal submission.",2022-01-14T16:09:05,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2021.09.07.459259,"Motivations, concerns and selection biases when posting preprints: a survey of bioRxiv authors","Nicholas Fraser, Philipp Mayr, Isabella Peters",2021-09-07

Indeed the authors are assessing spawning activity in aquatic species based on environmental DNA which is a non-invasive methodological approach of research for monitoring spawning activity on aquatic species. They studied on two medaka species (Oryzias latipes and O. sakaizumii,  in cross experiments and under laboratory conditions. They proposed an environmental DNA approach for monitoring and understanding spawning activity in fish. Their results are suggestive that an eDNA spike occurred in only male species after spawning activity AND THAT the magnitude of the eDNA spike was dependent on the number of spawning activities. They also demonstrated that spikes in the eDNA concentration are mainly caused by the release of sperm during spawning activity, and it can be used as evidence of spawning in field survey. Although the whole experimental design seems clear and straightforward, I would suggest that care should be taken intro account when interpreting laboratory -based finding into filed results. It would be also interesting to extend the discussion part about whether stress related behavioural responses or eDNA concentrations could be related to daily activities and also does personality may matter at all?

The goal of analyzing such a high number of particles has been something I have been calling for ever-since my work cited in the comment by Dr. Jacob Cram (Bizic-Ionescu et al., 2018). It’s exciting to see the efforts you have made in this direction. It’s equally exciting to see that my conclusion from 2018 that the initial colonization of particles is stochastic, is strongly featured in your paper title and well supported by your results. As Dr. Cram has mentioned in his comment, we discussed your study and have come up with several aspects that we feel deserve some attention and most likely to be better addressed in the manuscript. Some of these aspects were raised by Dr. Cram in his comment. However, we felt that our opinions on this manuscript were dissimilar enough to warrant separate comments, with some observations that overlap and some that differ. My general query goes to the applicability of the results to the natural environment, given several biases introduced by the chosen experimental system. I will list here my opinion on the source of these biases. 1) The concentration of seawater is likely to have generated an unrealistic microbial community. This is for three reasons (A) concentration of particle-attached microbes, (B) concentration of large bacteria, and (C) non-concentration of DOM: (A) Filtering the water through a 63 µm mesh should leave all particles smaller than this size in the water The subsequent step of gentle centrifugation most likely further concentrated these microparticles increasing their abundance above natural concentrations. (B) The gentle centrifugation likely selected for larger bacteria, as smaller cells may not be concentrated by a 5 min 4000 g run. (C) Finally, the seawater DOM on which bacteria can feed was not concentrated in this process. Therefore, the resulting inoculum used for the experiment contains a size-selected microbial community and a microparticle enrichment which in the absence of ambient DOM will rapidly drive the experiments towards consumption of the particulate organic matter at rates not representing the natural environment. 2) The incubation time and small volumes: While samples have been collected already after 12 h the experiment ran for 166 h in a closed microwell. It has been shown by many as well as by my colleagues and I  that after 24 h at the latest, the community in the experiment does not represent the environmental one (for example: Baltar et al., 2012; Ionescu et al., 2015; Herlemann et al., 2019). Therefore, seeing such long experiments conducted in fully closed systems, as in this paper, makes me wonder to what degree the rates of events observed in the lab are similar to rates in nature. 3) One possible problem with the incubation system used, is the effect of the microwell surface on microbial activity. Ploug and Jorgensen (1999), for example, came up with the net-jet system for measuring microprofiles on organic matter aggregates. However, aside of the effect of direct contact of particles with surfaces on particle properties and the microbial activity on it, a second issue is the formation of biofilms may form on the surfaces of the incubation system. Heterotrophic activity is known to increase in closed incubation systems (e.g. Fogg and Calvario-Martinez, 1989; Ionescu et al., 2015). Though it was shown that these biasing effects will occur regardless of bottle size (Hammes et al., 2010), these will likely have a stronger effect in very small incubation volumes (Herlemann et al., 2019), consuming oxygen and nutrients. I don’t recall reading whether the O2 concentration was monitored? My guess is that the system became anoxic relatively fast, unlike it would be in a natural environment. How does this affect the nature of associated (and active) bacteria? Having said that, I support the authors’ overall conclusion and applaud the effort that went into the data collection and analyses I am aware from my own work on the difficulties to obtain and maintain such a large number of particles in open systems, such as the one my colleagues and I designed. However, I think that the biases introduced by an experimental system should be openly discussed in the manuscript and if possible, explain how your results remain valid despite them. This is even more important when you often discuss late-stage particles, that are the most to be affected by aspects mentioned above. Sincerely, Mina Bizc References Baltar, F. et al.

The current therapeutic strategy largely focuses on the management of immune response there is an unmet need for better understanding progression and developing novel strategies to slow down disease progression. The authors took a methodical approach and demonstrated that by reviving mitochondrial activity by overexpressing  Pgc-1α in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice model  (EAE) they were able to rescue the EAE mice better than the WT mice. For their EAE mouse model, the authors used C57Bl mice immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35–55 peptide. Even though this model was widely used to understand multiple sclerosis, it is understood that the model is monophasic i.e. there is no clinical progression of disease after onset as presented in humans. It would be interesting to see how other EAE models such as  Biozzi ABH mice respond to Pgc-1α overexpression especially on the relapsing episodes. The cuprizone model is another interesting model where mitochondrial density increase was similar to post mortem MS pathophysiology. The authors did show induction of Pgc-1α increased calcium clearance, but they did not study the effect on ATP production. It will be informative if they can compare ATP levels in Pgc-1α induced and wild-type cells.",2022-01-11T18:03:29,krishnacaluri,Krishna C.

However, we feel that they do not reflect our results entirely correctly. As described in our paper, we ran molecular dynamics analyses for the theoretical description of the interaction. These resulted in a distance between 3.6 and 4.2 angstroms between R403 in Spike and E37 in ACE2 and a strong interaction. Both the distance range and the strength agree with recent studies (Lim et al., Scientific Reports 2020; Williams and Zhan, J. Phys. Chem. B. 2021; Laurini et al., ACS Nano, 2021). The importance of this interaction was confirmed by mutating E37 (Fig. 3). Bix and colleagues propose that the various cell types used in our study may not express integrins. This might be the case. However, it implies that the up to 50-fold enhancing effect of the T403R change on Spike-mediated infection is not dependent on integrins. Altogether, our experimental data clearly support an important role of T403R in ACE2 interaction. Our results do not exclude the possibility that this alteration may also affect the interaction with integrins. Currently, however, this is just speculative. We would be happy to provide the authors with Spike constructs allowing experimental challenging of their hypothesis. Best regards Fabian Zech, Christoph Jung, Konstantin M.J.

For this article, although I was senior author - I was not corresponding author as the work was largely led by Dr Swetha Vijayakrishnan. The article was rejected without review at two journals prior to being sent for review at the journal of record. It underwent two rounds of review before acceptance. Reviewer Comments (Round 1): Reviewer 1 In their manuscript Vijayakrishnan use Tokuyashi sections for electron microscopic imaging in the frozen hydrated state (‘cryo’). Tokuyashi sections are commonly used for immuno EM imaging in cell biology and then combined with dehydration. Direct imaging in the frozen-hydrated state results in higher molecular preservation compared to dehydration and resin embedding. The method is broadly applicable and relatively straightforward compared to cryo-FIB milling but does not allow comparable resolution levels. It was interesting to see that this manuscript again highlights the possible usefulness of cryo imaging of Tokoyashu sections. However, on the experimental side the reviewer does not see the novelty. In particular, Bos et al (ref. 13) seems to cover all novelty claims of the manuscript (application to cell culture, correlation with light microscopy). The remaining possibly novel aspect is the analysis of viruses by subtomogram averaging, which may shed some light on the quality of sample preparation. Nevertheless, the description of methods and analysis is somewhat superficial at this point. The conclusions on the association of pUL36 remain somewhat vague and do not appear statistically significant. Given the low resolution (~6 nm) indeed not too much can be concluded. Overall, the manuscript appears to touch on many things, but there is little novelty and conclusive results. Major points: - Page 5: “To our knowledge however, use of this method has thus far been confined to 3D imaging of tissue specimens 10-13.” This claim appears to be incorrect as Bos et al (ref. 13) applied the approach to cell culture – just as in this manuscript. Thus, it should be specifically stated which new contribution this manuscript makes to the field. - Page 5: “Here we present a modified strategy that combines correlative light microscopy and cryo-ET to locate regions of interest (ROI) in re-vitrified cell sections”. Again: what specifically is the novelty compared to ref. 13? - Page 14: “We successfully implemented this method …”. How do the authors validate their success? There are no quantifications provided. Is the method available? - Page 14: “To our knowledge this is the first attempt to implement this method on sub tomograms.” Previous implementations have already been reported in Schmid et al, PLOS Pathogens, possibly also later. - Probably the major problem in cryo-sectioning is the resulting compression. Thus, the reviewer would have expected an analysis of the effect of compression on subtomogram averages. Such analysis should be relatively straightforward given the available high-resolution structures of capsids. - The resolution of subtomogram averages appears overly low. Have the authors focused alignment and/or resolution measurement on specific parts of the capsids to compensate for compression and/or variable density in the core? - In the discussion the authors only compare cryo imaging of Tokuyashi sections to cryo-FIB milling / cryo-ET. A comparison to high-pressure freezing with freeze substitution and resin embedding should also be included. Reviewer 2 In this manuscript, Vijayakrishnan et al. present an approach that allows the visualization of cells that have previously been fixed (cross-linking) prior to imaging using electron cryo-microsocpy. In this case the sample is subsequently vitrified in a state where the macromolecules have been chemically altered but in a way that allows direct imaging as opposed to imaging a counterstain, such as osmium or uranyl compounds. The fixation of material is normally avoided due to the significant chemical alteration of macromolecules within sample, and makes the analysis of additional densities associated with any such macromolecule a potential minefield to study. The reviewer appreciates the need to make the analysis of cellular material using cryoEM easier, but is unconvinced that performing structural biology in a background of chemical fixation is an appropriate route to go and will inevitably lead to structural information that is wrong. The attempt to visualize viral capsids is an interesting application and is one that is sensible. The capsids in the nucleus look to have retained much of their native architecture. The argument put forward that the C-capsids in the nucleus have extra densities present seen in mature capsids is strong, but is beset by a lack of control experiments, a lack of analysis in terms of other material found in their preparations,  and a lack of appropriate interpretation of secondary analyses. 1. The use of fixation using this approach results in the material not being in a “native” state as is the case with regular cryoEM methods. This is significant as this alteration to the macromolecular structure means that any subsequent structural analysis will be potentially affected by artefacts of this approach. This reviewer believes therefore that one must be very careful when analyzing the results of any potential structural analysis in this manuscript. 2. The authors have not presented the proper controls for some of the interpretation of their results. A control is needed here to structurally analyse the herpesvirus capsid with the CVSC (positive control) after fixation – this should be relatively easy if you fix the mature virions and do sub-volume averaging on these virions to assess whether deformities in the CVSC structure are introduced. It is a gross misrepresentation to compare this structure in a fixed/unnatural/dead state to one from the EMDB determined in a frozen-hydrated state as has been done in Figure 5. These controls also apply to the subsequent analysis to determine the architecture of the capsid pore vertex. The capsids found in the cytosol exhibit significant breakage and are distorted when compared to those in found inside the nucleus (see figure 3) and is not commented in the manuscript. This is a significant concern as it would suggest that there is some damage to the structural integrity of potential targets. It also a shame, as the cytosolic capsids would appear to me to be a great target to compare structurally with the nuclear capsids. This would also be a concern were anyone wanting to use this approach to target processes occurring in the cytosol, as it seems there is a greater effect on macromolecules in this subcellular compartment. 3. The cells are initially grown to confluency as a monolayer and then infected with the virus for 12hr. At this time point the cells are fixed which completely kills the cells. The cells are then scraped and pelleted. One assumes that after fixation of cells  there is significant disruption to the structural integrity of the cells – a picture or demonstration of the state of the cells after this treatment would help to understand what exactly goes into the subsequent steps. Figure S1 shows widespread DAPI staining illustrating the point that there is significant mixing of compartments making knowing exactly what is being imaged difficult. My concern is that an additional step is needed to ascertain where is being imaged as the DAPI is almost everywhere. 4. The attempt to classify the capsid 5-fold vertices makes the analysis of the CVSC confusing and brings up further questions about what is really going on as the analysis done here restores the CVSC to the B-capsids. The techniques outlined aim to address a curious debate in the herpesvirus field – namely whether the capsid vertex specific component (CVSC) is present on C-capsids on the nucleus, and it is important to frame the conclusions of the paper in this context. The protein component has multiple names that reflects the belief among different members in the herpesvirus community as to its true role or when/where/how it functions in relation to the capsid. The CVSC is made up primarily of pUL17 and pUL25 with a significant contribution of two helices from the C-terminal tail of pUL36. pUL36 is a very large protein, and its presence in the nucleus is unlikely in is full-length state. Debate continues in the field as to whether splice isoforms of pUL36 contribute to binding at the CVSC in the nucleus. In the present study, extra density is visible on C-capsids that is not visible on other capsids types (A and B), though in the case of B-capsids this density is visible after classification. These discrepancies need to be cleared up as the resolution limitation on the capsids makes it impossible to say what components are visible on the CVSC at this point – UL17 and UL25? UL17, Ul25 and extra density (UL36?)? 5. Washing the sections a few times in PBS after infiltration would seem to this reviewer not wholly effective at removing73 the sucrose. Fig3 – halo around the multimembrane. 6. The sentence “The pentaskelion density in B-capsids is more prominent than C-capsids; likely owing to far greater numbers of B-capsids (526) used during processing than of C-capsids (125). These data support our suggestion that low occupancy of CATC on B-capsids led to weaker density in icosahedrally averaged density maps. They are clearly visible upon asymmetric reconstruction (Figure 6), but not during symmetric reconstruction (Figure 4).” The significance of this analysis is not clearly explained. 7. Introduction is far too long – I suggest the authors rewrite in order to make it more concise and streamlined i.e. significance of SPA, the play-off between cryoET and classical methods and the need to find more approachable methods. This introduction could be written with the same effect in half the space. 8. It would really help the reader to have a correlative figure in the supplement (for example in S1) that goes from light microscopy Figure 1. The DAPI stain is present in the field of view of both cytosolic and nuclear regions – why is this? It is very hard to discern in this figure how the determination of what is nucleus and what is cytoplasm is made. Figure 2. Why have the authors excluded fluorescence data from this figure? One would assume this would be the most effective use of their correlative approach as it is possible to actually discern cellular features directly through EM here. The segmentation in Figure 2b is something of an eyesore. I would redraw or redesign a mean of highlighting the membranes. It is not easy to see the different types of capsid with this annotation- an A-capsid is not highlighted (left of field of view) for example, and the box is not immediately obvious. Why box and arrow? Why not all box or all arrow? Panel d is completely unannotated. Why is there a halo around the multilamellar vesicle (that is not a CTF effect)? Figure 3. The authors should comment on why the capsids in panels A and B look undamaged, while those in C and D exhibit significant damage/deformation. Figure 4. Why do the densities interface between the capsid coat and the inner regions blur as you move from A to B and C? A myriad of cryoEM structures of viral capsids have been determined and do not exhibit such an artefact. Figure 5. The comparison in this figure is not appropriate at all for a number of reasons: the structures are determined via different means (fixed vs non-fixed), the structures are at completely different resolutions which I consider to be a cynical attempt to improve how the authors’ own data appear - the figure on the right should at least be presented at the same resolution as the authors. The colour scheme is inadequate to show the CVSV, which should be the only thing visible here to help the reader to see what the authors are referring to in its entirety. Figure 6. The data in this figure are in conflict with those shown in Figure 5, and leads to some confusion. Symmetrically-determined 5-fold vertices are classified in an asymmetric manner. Therefore, the number of icosahedrally-related positions for the C-capsids remains the same. The data suggest that if you relax the symmetry then the CVSC density on the C-capsids smears due to low numbers – but this seems completely illogical to me. Why would an ordered density smear? Remember that this structure can be refined to ~3.5Å in cryoEM. If the occupancy in B-capsids is too low to get an effective CVSC in an icohedral reconstruction why would it be better in an asymmetric classification unless the structure of the CVSC is different to that of A-capsids? What happens if you reduce the number of particles from each each virus type to be the same number? Does the B-capsid density also smear? Once again, using the EMDB structure as shown in C is inappropriate. Figure S1. It is almost impossible to know how the authors came to the determination that these are different regions of the cell from this figure. This figure makes it clear that it is hard to determine what parts of the cell belong to where. Reviewer Comments (Round 2): Reviewer 2 It is a shame that the current pandemic has resulted in the shutdown of the Authors’ Institute, and the reviewer would like to express their sympathy for this situation. Hopefully, things will change in the coming months. The lack of experiments validating either of the method or the major results (putative CVSC density on the capsid surface in the nucleus) is still a major concern, and without such experiments it is not possible for the reviewer to recommend publication. 1.    Publishing a single structural result at low resolution and without further validation either from comparison to other subcellular structures (e.g. ribosome or cytosolic capsids) or using biochemical means (e.g. immunolabelling with nanogold of CVSC components) adds to the confusion in the literature as to whether the CVSC is present, in part, whole or not at all, in the nucleus or not and such a publication would not be beneficial. Should analyses on other components also lead to structures that exhibit no difference to results previously published one can be more confident in novel results – though still not 100%. 2.    It is still unclear to this reviewer how exactly capsids are determined to be nuclear from the analysis of Figures 1, 2, and S1. While it is possible to see regions of membranes, the fact that the cells are disrupted using their methodology combined with the presence of DAPI in multiple regions adds to the confusion as to whether the nuclear capsids are indeed nuclear capsids. In Figure 1, it is possible to make out blue dots and red dots separate from one another and together.  Capsids also containing DNA and would likely be stained by DAPI.  This is not followed on in Figure 2, which is annotated manually. Is it assumed all capsids away from membranous regions are nuclear? 3.    In Figure S1, the caption says nuclei are stained with DAPI. Everything seems to be stained with DAPI. 4.    Figure 4 separates A-, B- and C-capsids. C-capsids would be more prevalent in the cytosol as this is a sign of maturity. Through following Figure 1 and Figure 2 it is not clear how the isolation of populations from subcellular components is achieved.  The authors should think about how to make this process clearer. 5.    In terms of the method itself, the Authors propose this as a relatively easy method for routine examination of macromolecules in situ. This should mean that subcellular structures should not be difficult to determine and well know samples should be examined. This reviewer would like to re-assert the point that chemical fixation in a background macromolecular milieu is prone to artifacts. As such, fixation in cellulo vs in vitro is different. This is reflected in a statement that remains in the text of the manuscript: “The use of chemical fixative may cause some structural artefacts, possibly contributing to the low resolution of capsid structures in our study (5-6 nm), in comparison to resolutions obtained from subtomogram averaging of proteins from unfixed cryo-ET of for example purified virions (0.8-2 nm).” In the Authors’ rebuttal, they make the point that gradient fixation methods have been previously employed to determine structures of macromolecular complexes. However, the objective of these methods is to stabilise complexes of recombinantly expressed and isolated macromolecules that are prone to falling apart under buffer conditions. Furthermore, the complexes are known as they are biochemically characterised. The original grafix paper (Kastner et al., 2008) argues that the potential for the technique to improve structure determination is due to homogeneity, and this is borne out by the citations of that article. There is also a contradiction in logic; if chemical fixation is one stated factor potentially limiting the resolution of the capsids in this manuscript, why then are grafix methods elsewhere able to be used to determine high-resolution structures. Is It due to the presence of cross-linked entities or due to lack of particles? Such questions are why I feel the need for more work is required to validate the major finding. Finally, a 40-60Å structure is not equivalent to a 3-4Å structure and should not be presented as such. Reviewer 3 In this manuscript, Vijayakrishnan et al describe the in-situ structures of HSV-1 capsids within the nuclei of host cells determined by subtomogram averaging, coupled with correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) of re-vitrified cell sections. Although at low resolutions, the reconstructions of the three types of capsids show the major components of penton, hexon and triplex. In addition, the C-capsids within the nucleus have extra densities, contributed by the capsid-vertex specific component (CVSC), are readily observed. The structural work is interesting in that the authors demonstrates an economic, easier and high-throughput approach to determine the in-situ structures of viruses using re-vitrified sections. However, a number of overstatements or concerns have to be corrected or be addressed before the publication. 1. In the abstract on page 2: “Our reconstructions reveal that the capsid associated tegument complex is present on capsids prior to nuclear egress.” This is an overstatement. Previous single particle cryo-EM works have demonstrated that the CVSC binds to capsid prior to nuclear egress. (Conway at al., JMB 2010; Homa et al., JMB 2013; Dai et al., Science 2018 and Ref 29) 2. In the introduction on page 6: “Our data reveal the presence of the CVSC pentaskelion on HSV nucleocapsids in the nucleus, suggesting that capsids may bind the tegument protein pUL36 (VP1/2) prior to nuclear egress.” This is again an overstatement. Previous single particle cryo-EM works have already revealed the presence of the CVSC on HSV C capsids purified from the nucleus. 3. On page 10: “There has been uncertainty in the HSV field of how pUL36 and pUL37 are recruited to the capsid, if this happens within the nucleus or after nuclear egress. To shed light on this question, we carried out cryo-ET on the mutant lacking pUL37 (FRΔUL37).” Given the low resolution of the HSV capsid reconstruction determined by the authors, this work has no help to solve the uncertainty of how pUL36 is recruited to the capsid. 4. Page 14: “Moreover, our analysis revealed pronounced star-like CVSC density at the penton vertex in the C-capsids, comparable to previously reported high-resolution structures of capsids within purified HSV-1 virions.” The CVSC density of nucleocapsid from virion are obviously better than the counterpart from the C-capsid. While the nucleocapsid shows strong CVSC densities extending from the penton to the triplex Ta, the C-capsid shows a much weaker and smaller tegument densities that only bind to the penton of C-capsid (Fig. 5). 5. Page 15: “Our method opens the possibility of determining and characterising specific complexes and their interactions at high-resolution within the functional context of the cell or tissue, providing snapshots of important and dynamic events in biology.” Given the poor resolution of the HSV capsid determined in this work, this statement is hard to be justified. 6. Page 20: “The subvolumes were subjected to 3D classification with a T value of 5, to reconstruct a single 5-fold vertex, without refining orientations and origins. A total of 10 classes were calculated with one of them identified to have apparent pentaskelion density over the 5-fold axis, corresponding to CVSC, in both B-capsids and C-capsids. "" It is well established that all the vertices of HSV C-capsid and virion nuelcocapsid are fully occupied by CVSC, why only one of the ten classes has apparent pentaskelion density over the 5-fold axis in the C-capsid? 7.

This article presents the work of a number of students and post-docs that passed through my lab over many years, we attacked the problem from a number of different directions before we achieved an interpretable structure, through the application of Cryo-electron tomography and sub-tomogram averaging. The paper was rejected without review by two journals. We made it out to review at the next journal we submitted to, but unfortunately the article was rejected following one negative review. I found the quality of that review rather disappointing, but the journal refused our appeal (see below). Fortunately we had a far better experience at the journal of record where the paper was handled by a very supportive editor and peer-reviewers were positive about our work. The review process there is transparent, the critique is available on the publisher site. Here is the peer-review report that led to the paper being rejected. Thanks to reviewer 2 for their constructive report. Reviewer 1 - not so much. Reviewer: 1 This is a paper that might have been submitted 10 (or even 20) years ago, but is so far from current standards in cryo-EM that I have no enthusiasm for seeing it published, even in a more specialized journal. The authors talk about how the problems frustrated attempts at a Fourier-Bessel 3D reconstruction, but it has been many years since people used such approaches. Modern software, such as Relion or cryoSPARC, all use iterative realspace methods for helical reconstruction. The analysis of the lattice is based upon one horribly noisy power spectrum from one tube. Many other large diameter tubes have been studied at high resolution, and almost all of these involve variability in diameters. The authors should look at Kalia et al., Nature, 2018 on Drp1 tubes, or Junglas et al., Cell, 2021 on PspA tubes to see how such problems are routinely treated. The paper is filled with statements such as how the features they see are ""morphologically very similar to previously described decameric and undecameric rings produced by recombinant expression of RSV N"" or how ""making accurate measurements of the lattice was challenging"" or ""leading to these densities appearing to be more closely packed in the sub-tomogram average than they actually are"". Given all of this, I found all of the modeling highly questionable. Reviewer: 2 General comments RSV is an important human pathogen and the main cause of bronchiolitis in newborn children. There is no vaccine nor efficient antiviral compounds against this virus and the exact architecture of virions remains to be deciphered. In this work, the authors have used cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) and cryogenic electron tomography (cryoET) to study the architecture of real RSV particles. They also used a particular technique to obtain these impressive data, the growing of RSV particles directly on transmission electron microscopy grids before flash freezing. This important detail was critical to obtain original filamentous viral particles instead of heterogenous and anarchic shaped virions as seen in previous publications. The use of a 300 keV electron microscope allowed images of unprecedented high quality, revealing a couple of quite unexpected results: (1) viral particles are much more organized than expected; (2) the matrix layer is formed by M-dimers geometrically organized as a curved lattice; (3) the presence of ring-shaped assemblies, likely formed of the nucleocapsid protein N and RNA and packaged within RSV particles in addition to the helical, long and filamentous viral genome encapsidated by the N protein; (4) there is a helical ordering of the glycoproteins on the virus surface (5) … that tend to cluster in pairs. The structural data presented in this manuscript are novel, convincing and make a significant contribution to the field. The data show for the first time that RSV particles exhibit helical symmetry at two levels, the matrix protein and the surface glycoproteins. Using the previously resolved atomic structure of M dimers, they modeled the lattice of M dimers that coordinate virions assembly and helical ordering of the glycoproteins at the surface of virions. The viral genomic RNA, 15 kb in length, is encapsidated by the viral nucleocapsid protein (N) to form a left-handed helical ribonucleoprotein complex. However, when N was previously expressed as a recombinant protein, N-RNA rings were obtained in bacteria or using the baculovirus system; but their presence, their role in infected cells and their possible presence in viral particles was totally unknown. The presence of RNA-N rings in viral particles was unexpected and intriguing result, raising new questions, in particular do these N-RNA rings packaged in virions play a role in the viral cycle or are they packaged incidentally? Do they contain some specific RNAs? The images indicate that they are located around the central nucleocapsid containing the viral genome. Specific comments Although the paper is well written, there are a lot of references which are not the right ones, missing or misplaced: Introduction “The viral RNA is encapsidated by multiple copies of the viral encoded nucleocapsid protein (N) to form a left-handed helical ribonucleoprotein complex (or nucleocapsid - NC).» Reference 6 (Bakker et al., 2013) should be placed at the end of this sentence as well as ref 14 (Liljeroos et al., 2013). « This serves as the template for RNA synthesis by the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)6,7”: the demonstration that Nucleocapsid serves as a template for the polymerase was not shown in references 6 & 7. This assumption was for a long time inferred from data obtained with paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses. In Garcia et al., 1993 (doi: 10.1006/viro.1993.1366), transient coexpression of RSV N and P proteins in eukaryotic cells resulted in the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions that resembled the inclusion bodies found in infected cells. In Garcia-Barreno et al., 1996 (doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.2.801-808.1996), the interaction domains between P and N were identified, then further in Slack and Easton, 1998 (doi: 10.1016/s0168-1702(98)00042-2), Khattar et al., 2001 (doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-82-4-775), Castagne et al., 2004 (doi:10.1099/vir.0.79830-0.), Tran et al. 2007 (ref 33), Asenjo et al., 2008 (doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2007.11.013). Sourimant et al. in 2015 (doi: 10.1128/JVI.03619-14) showed that P binds L through its C-terminal region, which was confirmed by Gilman et al. (ref 10). “… thought to occur in virus induced cytoplasmic organelles called inclusion bodies8,9. »: should refer to Rincheval et al., Nat Commun. 2017 too (doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00655-9), which was the first paper showing that viral RNA synthesis occur in inclusion bodies for RSV. “The RdRp comprises two proteins: the catalytic large (L) protein and the phosphoprotein (P) that mediates the interaction with the NC 10. »: again, the reference 10 only describe the structure of the PL complex. “the matrix protein (M), which coordinates virion assembly together with M2-1 ». The role of M2-1 in the architecture of RSV is still debated. Although the location of M2-1 between M and the nucleocapsid was suggested by Kiss et al., 2014 and Liljeroos et al., 2013, Meshram and Oomens in 2019 ( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.v... have shown that P, M and F are sufficient for the formation of viral pseudoparticles, which wasconfirmed by Bajorek et al., 2021 (doi: 10.1128/JVI.02217-20). Furthermore, incorporation of N in VLP did not need M2-1 (Forster et al., 2015 ref 15; Fig.6A). Although in Li et al. 2008 (doi:10.1128/JVI.00343-08) some experiments suggested that M2-1 is needed to recruit M to inclusion bodies, this was denied in Bajorek et al., 2021 who also showed that M directly interacts with P. “M2-1 forms a second layer at the virion interior, under the M-layer, and associates with NCs 13,14. »: again, I think the authors have transformed a hypothesis into an assertion considered as definitively accepted. “High resolution structures for some of the envelope associated proteins of both RSV and HMPV have been determined by X-ray crystallography, including the matrix proteins 15-17 the F glycoprotein 18,19 and M2-1 20,21. »: again, the first structure of RSV M2-1 was published by Tanner et al., 2014 (doi:10.1073/pnas.1317262111). Results Legend of Fig.2: the authors highlighted with colors the presence of glycoproteins, M protein and M2-1 protein on the tomogram (“The lipid bilayer is highlighted in pale blue, the matrix layer in orange and the M2-1 layer in dark blue. »). Although there can be no ambiguity for surface glycoproteins, concerning M and mostly M2-1 the situation is more uncertain. A formal demonstration of the presence of these proteins would require additional experiments such as immunogold labeling (not compatible with cryo-EM) or corelative microscopy. Could it be for example the phosphoprotein? Although highly disordered, this protein could be compacted and folded in the viral particles. The authors should be more prudent and talk of probable or putative localization for these last two proteins like they do in the text where they say “Underlying the lipid bilayer is a contiguous density that we attribute to the matrix protein (M). ». “The virion interior is densely packed with viral nucleocapsids, mainly having the characteristic herringbonemorphology 31 and suggesting that in common with several other mononegavirales, RSV virions are polyploid 32 (fig 3A, movie S1 timepoint 1m 08s). »: on the picture and in the movies we only see one continuous helical nucleocapsid. Were several nucleocapsids in the same axis along the filamentous viral particles? Were several parallel nucleocaspids observed in some portions? In Fig.3A the herringbone structure is placed at the centre of the viral filament; was it always the case? Was the length of nucleocaspids as expected or were there some truncated genomes? The presence of N-RNA rings in the viral particles was unexpected and very surprising; the authors say : “….strongly suggest that many of these objects may indeed be N-RNA rings, perhaps being products of aborted genome replication. ». Can the authors exclude that these objects could contain cellular RNAs? Recombinant expression of RSV N protein has shown that there is no apparent sequence specificity for RNA encapsidation. Cellular short RNAs such as tRNA could also be encapsidated in rings.",2022-01-06T08:28:03,disqus_Ao3NahMvYd,David Bhella,10.1101/2021.08.04.455049,Helical Ordering of Envelope Associated Proteins and Glycoproteins in Respiratory Syncytial Virus Filamentous Virions,"Michaela J.

This article was rejected without review at one other journal prior to acceptance after peer review in the journal of record; Reviewer #1 (Comments for the Author): In this manuscript, the authors describe the structure of virus-like particle (VLP) of vesivius 2117 using high-resolution cryo-EM. By comparing the structure of the major capsid protein of VP1 of 2117 to the VP1 of other known calicivirus structures including other Vesiviruses such as San Miguel Sealion virus (Chen et al., PNAS 2006), and feline calicivirus (Ossiboff et al. JVI, 2010, not cited in this paper; and Conley et al., Nature 2015), they show that 2117 VP1 exhibit significant differences in the P2 subdomain. They further contend that VP1 of 2117 is more similar to the VP1 of rabbit hemorrhagic diseases virus belonging to Lagovirus genus in the Caliciviridae. The manuscript is short and succinctly written. The structure determination by single-particle cryo-EM is technically sound. The results are interesting showing divergence of the structural features, although to be expected, in the P2 (sub)domain that is responsible for receptor interactions and cell entry processes. However, firstly, because the entire focus of the manuscript is to show that 2117 exhibits major structural differences in the P2 subdomain compared to other vesivirus structures, and secondly that the authors state that the density at the distal tips of the P2 domain was noisy and difficult to interpret, the following major comments must be addressed. Major Comments: 1) The authors should include a figure comparing the P2 subdomain sequences of 2117 with that of SMSV and FCV to make a better sense of the observed structural differences, perhaps indicating 1) which regions in the P2 subdomain in 2117 the density is poor, 2) which regions are difficult were difficult to interpret and 3) where the model fitting was poor. 2) Fig S2 with a dark background is difficult to assess the quality of the cryo-EM map and the fitting of the model to density. Consider a white background, it would be helpful to indicate the residue number at some residues. Authors should also consider including representative regions in the density map along with the model in the S and P1 (which I suppose show better definition and fitting). 3) Although the overall model fitting statistics are summarized in the Methods section, authors should provide such statistics for the P2 subdomain region. 4) It is not clear as to what software was used for initial data processing, 2D classification, and 3D reconstruction prior to post-refinement using Relion. Reviewer #2 (Comments for the Author): In this short report, the authors describe the cryo-EM structure of the vesivirus 2117 virus-like particle formed by baculovirus-expression of the VP1 gene in insect cells at 3.6 Angstroms and compare it to the structure of FCV strain F9 virion (PDB 6GSH) that the authors have previously published. The authors note that the S domain and N-terminal arm structures are conserved and similar between both structures, but not differences in the protruding domain. Specifically, they note a 22 amino acid insertion between beta strands 2 and 3 of the P2 beta barrel (residues 409-468 in VP1) of FCV. Previously, the authors have shown that this insertion forms a 'cantilevered' arm that upon binding of the FCV receptor JAM-A lifts towards the receptor exposing a cleft in the side of the P2 domain that can accommodate a helix of the VP2 protein. The authors show that the structures of vesivirus 2117 VLPs differs from that of the FCV-F9 virion. Based on this difference the authors note that the absence of the cantilevered arm in vesivirus 2117 leads to its more rounded capsomere; they further suggest that these differences indicate major functional differences in receptor engagement and VP2 portal assembly between the FCV clade of the vesiviruses and other caliciviridae. The paper is well written and easy to follow. My main critique is that the ideas regarding major differences in receptor engagement and VP2 portal assembly between the FCV clade and the vesivirus 2117 are supported by the structural differences between a virion (FCV-F9) and a VLP (2117 without any confirmatory data. Clarification of wording within the text and more conservative language in conclusions would strengthen the report. Points: 1. Please make clear in the text that the structural comparison is between a VLP and an intact virion; perhaps add a caveat about possible structural difference imposed by the presence of the genome and VP2. 2. Is it possible that major functional difference in receptor engagement do not occur and that the conformational changes upon engagement with the functional receptor of Vesivirus 2117 lead to structural changes similar (albeit not identical) to that of FCV with insertion of VP2 helices into a groove in P2? If so please add a sentence stating this. 3. Is it possible that the cantilevered arm hides a neutralizing epitope that is present in vesivirus 2117 and that the acquisition of the loop insertion allowed the FCV clade to better evade immune detection? If this is possible, please add a sentence to address this possibility. Minor edits 4. Results and Discussion, paragraph 2 states that the VP1 subunits are labelled as A, B, and C in Fig 1D. This labelling is absent from Fig 1D. Please add in labelling to this figure panel and clarify each subunit based on color in figure 1 legend as well. 5. Figure 1 legend wording implies that both panels E and F are shown with rainbow coloring, but only panel F has this feature. Add rainbow coloring to panel E (preferable) or adjust wording in Fig 1 legend. 6. Please incorporate Figs S1 and S2 into the manuscript to meet JVI's policy. The two movies are fine - nice movies!

Adaptive evolution is difficult to study on short time scales, particularly in asexual organisms. This manuscript analyzes the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 since its introduction, and is timely and impressive in its ambitions. Never before has so much data existed on a single virus or organism, particularly in the earliest stages of a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 provides a unique well-powered opportunity to study the genomic loci driving adaptation and its tempo, as multiple lineages have evolved convergently and therefore provide the opportunity for meaningful statistical inferences. As such, this manuscript is of great importance to fundamental biology and applied understanding of the ongoing pandemic. The manuscript convincingly demonstrates that strong adaptive evolution drove genomic changes in SARS-CoV-2, with a large portion of that adaptive evolution concentrated in spike S1. The finding of signatures of adaptation with single nucleotide resolution is of strong clinical relevance and compelling. We have some significant concerns about inference of changing selective pressures and the new method of detecting selection via logistic growth. Major points 1) Changes in dN/dS over time might be expected even under constant selection pressure: Figure 2 makes a visual argument for increasing adaptive pressure on S1 over time. This visual argument is so impactful that it has been largely interpreted on social media and elsewhere as evidence that adaptive selection in S1 is driven primarily by immune evasion. This connection makes sense, as pressure from the human immune system has almost certainly increased as the pandemic has progressed. However, this analysis might be confounded by the fact that dN/dS measured in asexual populations strongly depends upon the age of the variants included in the analysis -- with more recent mutations showing a more elevated N/S ratio (DOI: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.08.037). While the mechanisms driving this often-observed pattern are not completely resolved, the most common explanation is that weakly deleterious mutations are observable on short time scales, but purged from the population on long time scales-- purifying selection takes time to act. Therefore, even if there was constant adaptive pressure to change the amino acid sequence in S1 since the start of the pandemic, it might be possible to observe an increase in N/S over time from the analysis conducted in Figure 2. Some amino acid changes in S1 are likely adaptive, while others are mildly deleterious. Mildly deleterious mutations can be observed/measured at the tips of the tree, but are highly unlikely to be observed on internal nodes leading to long-lived lineages. Unless we are misunderstanding something, the analysis is conducted in a manner such that mutations dated to earlier in the pandemic are more biased towards long-lived lineages. While ‘early’ mutations include some that do not reach high frequency nor persist for long periods of time (because of inclusion of sequences from each timepoint), rare lineages that were only detected later in the pandemic also contribute to ‘early’ mutations -- while rare lineages that died out (perhaps because they possessed some deleterious mutations) are detected less frequently. This leads to a bias towards successful lineages for ‘early’ mutations but not for ‘late’ mutations. Therefore, an increase of dN/dS over time could be observed in this analysis without any change in selective pressures. To determine that a change in the strength of adaptive pressures occured, an analysis could be performed that removes the impact of purifying selection. For example, an analysis that only considers external leaves on the tree, with a separate tree built for each timepoint considered, might remove this confounder. It would be helpful to see Orf8 and other genes with high rates of nonsynonymous mutation in Figure 2 for comparison to S1. 2) As metrics of N/S are dependent upon time since the most recent common ancestor, it is expected that N/S should be lower in influenza than a newly emerged pandemic virus. In addition, since this topic is of interest to a wide audience, care should be taken to ensure that comparisons of N/S ratios are not confused with rates of adaptive change. 3) Other questions about increasing selection pressure: Figure 2 and 3 appear to have a common link-- in that S1 mutations are favored beginning sometime in mid to late 2020. However, all the specific lineage trajectories shown in Figure 3 and the corresponding supplement have an accumulation burst that plateaus before the start of 2021 -- while the dN/dS curve for S1 in Figure 2 continues to increase during this time. Do the authors have an explanation for this? The clustering of S1 mutations over time is an interesting and important finding. If we are understanding correctly, S1 mutations are not just clustered in time, but are also found on the same exact branches of the phylogeny. If this is the case, it is possible that such mutations reflect compensatory or epistatistic mutations -- for example, a potentially adaptive mutation at one site might require another mutation to compensate for a tradeoff in protein folding. If epistasis at adaptive S1 loci is strong, the finding of clustering of mutations in time would not necessarily reflect a time-dependent selective pressure. To address this the authors might repeat the simulations in Figure 3 while counting mutations that occur on the same exact branch as a single mutational event. If S1 mutations are not on the same exact branch of the phylogeny, the authors might directly explore or reject the possibility of compensatory mutation by showing the ordering of mutations in the S1 protein (consistent ordering would suggest epistasis as in DOI:10.1038/ng.1038 and DOI:10.1038/ng.3148). 4) Calculating growth rate is tricky from biased observational data, and technical choices and confounding variables are capable of creating noise and/or bias that might limit the utility of an approach based on logistic growth rates. --Growth rate estimates are based on changes in relative frequencies derived from data that was normalized to have equal global distributions at each timepoint. However, the global incidences of disease were not equal at every timepoint. As such, the frequencies of clades in regions with low incidence will be overestimated in this approach, while also being subject to more stochastic noise from superspreading events. This may lead to spuriously high increases or decreases of clade abundances over time. Some analysis with a normalization based on global incidence (perhaps restricted to a geographic area with stable approaches to measuring incidence) or simulation of how sampling impacts downstream results would be helpful for understanding the strengths and limitations of this new approach. --The values on the y-axis in Figure 1A and Figure 1B -- number of mutations per clade -- are not independent. Different clades within the same lineage (e.g. variants of Delta) will all have both high growth rate and and high # of S mutations because of their shared ancestry. If a lineage happened to contain both a high number of S mutations and an unrelated adaptive mutation, any variants within this lineage would have both properties. As such, it would be important to see these analyses calculated within lineages, or with completely unrelated lineages. --The comparisons between genes made in terms of correlation of logistic growth rate and number of mutations are not supported by statistics on the uncertainty of the correlation coefficient. It is unclear if the differences between genes and between N vs S mutations are impacted by the number of mutations in each group or how many mutations are needed to get significant signals. --It is not clear exactly what is meant by ‘the last 6 weeks’ in regards to the calculation of logistic growth rate presented in Figure 1 and elsewhere. Is this the last 6 weeks in the timecourse studied or the 6 weeks after the lineage emerged? In Figure 4C, it appears that logistic growth rate is calculated at different time intervals. --Logistic growth rates are strongly impacted by competition -- a lineage with an adaptive mutation might decrease because there is another more fit lineage competing with it. Therefore, there is expected to be high variation in growth rate among lineages with the same mutations, and Figure 4A-B suggest this is the case. This might limit the power of this approach. Have the authors considered using the max growth rate instead? --It would be helpful to see more discussion on the limitations of the method proposed here. What conditions are needed for this method to be accurate and informative? What conditions would break the method? Minor: How exactly the number of mutations is calculated in Figure 4A and B should be clarified in the text and methods. Figure 4C makes it seem that convergence is calculated within a particular time interval (as some intervals show convergence while others don’t), but this isn’t indicated anywhere. If convergence is calculated in a given time interval, it would be interesting to understand how these analyses change when convergence is calculated on the whole tree. The legend in Figure 5B “Mean increase in mutations after specified event” is unclear and at first read was interpreted as a rate. A rate or other normalized value would be more informative here than the absolute number of mutations, as the specified events occur at different times. Numbers of mutations might be normalized by time, compared to the total number of mutations genome-wide after the event, or compared to the number of S mutations in each gene after the event. The introduction addresses important challenges in identifying evolution on short time scales. The authors should also note the challenges for organisms that do not recombine frequently. In particular, genome-wide hitchhiking (draft) complicates scans for adaptation based on allele frequencies-- because neutral or even deleterious alleles can reach high frequency if on the background of an adaptive mutation. These drafted mutations increase noise, thereby decreasing the signal/noise ratio. The authors should discuss the minimal correlation found between the number of independent occurrences of a mutation and the mean logistic growth rate for those mutations at more length. We expect convergence to be a strong indicator of positive selection, so the lack of correlation here requires discussion in the context of logistic growth rate method. One possibility is that these mutations are measuring different things. For example, convergent mutations occurring during a particular time window might reflect mutations that are only adaptive on particular genomic backgrounds, or they might reflect mutations that are adaptive for immune evasion with some hosts but incur a pleiotropic cost for spreading efficiency. It would be helpful to standardize how mutations in Orf1 or its subunits are presented between all figure panels and the text.",2022-01-05T23:53:36,tdlieberman,tdlieberman,10.1101/2021.09.11.459844,Rapid and parallel adaptive mutations in spike S1 drive clade success in SARS-CoV-2,"Kathryn E.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.10.472064v1#comment-5675343093,biorxivstage,1,"This manuscript describes a layer-fMRI sequence comparison study to determine which experimental approach is best suited for cognitive working memory tasks with decoding analyses in the primary visual cortex. The research question of the best layer-fMRI sequence and corresponding ‘benchmarking’ of fMRI sequences has been one of the most debated topics in the field. Over the last three decades, there have been several dozen such studies in the context of sub-millimeter fMRI resolutions. Those studies focused on investigations of the biophysical properties (mechanisms) in preclinical models, as well as investigations of their utility in the experimental setup of human cognitive neuroscience experiments. Unfortunately, none of these studies had ever yielded generalisable results about the superiority of a given sequence over other ones, and none of these studies resulted in a general consensus in the field. Despite the abundance of many previous sequence comparison studies, I think the study of this manuscript is valuable to the emerging field of layer-fMRI in multiple aspects: -> The manuscript highlights that the overall main layer-dependent fMRI modulation is consistent across sequences. This is an informative confirmation that the results from previous application studies can be trusted, no matter which specific sequence was used. This confirmation is valuable to the field. -> The manuscript confirms that MVPA analyses might be viable in layer-fMRI for contrasts beyond GE-BOLD. This finding is not established so far and thus, such results represent valuable information in the field. -> The study uses a highly unconventional experimental design of 4 participants scanned across 6 sessions each. I find this way of ‘deep’ data acquisition very valuable. And I think it is a good reminder to the field that layer-fMRI should not be judged with the standards of common fMRI of many participants with very short scans. I have a few concerns about the this manuscript listed below: ### 1.) Concerns about sequence comparison studies, in general: ### ######################################################## Personally, I am an opponent of sequence comparison studies, which aim to find one single ‘winner sequence’ that is superior to other sequences. I find this way of thinking distracting and unhealthy for the field. My thoughts are layed out here: -> 5 min overview video: https://youtu.be/m6TMjm620JI -> Blog post: https://layerfmri.com/the-b... For the reasons mentioned in the links above, I do not agree with the conclusion that any given sequence can be most favorable for “typical cognitive neuroscience”. The crux in sequence comparison studies is that there is no such thing as universal “the VASO” or “the SE-EPI”. Sequences are not like mysterious phenomena of mother nature that can be examined for generalizable conclusions. Instead, sequences are completely man-made engineering products and each sequence implementation can be substantially different from one another. E.g., the most widely used VASO sequence of VE (Terra) is quite different from most VASO sequences on VB (‘old’ 7T). And similarly, a ‘classical’ single-shot SE-EPI sequence will provide a very different sensitivity-specificity compromise compared to a more modern segmented SE-EPI method (Han 2021). In fact, I believe that in this study, the favorable sensitivity of the SE-EPI sequence is mostly driven by T2’-contaminations of the long echo train length and the unwanted T2* weighting in outer k-space lines. And I expect that the conclusions of this study will be quite different if they would be carried out with faster readout-speeds (smaller matrix size, or modern head-gradients). ### 2.) Concern about considering sequences as isolated entities ### ######################################################## I have the impression that the manuscript’s reasoning inherently implies that for common application studies one single sequence would be used. I have the impression that this manuscript views sequences as competitors. This is against the trend in the field. I think it has become a standard in the field of layer-fMRI to not rely on one single contrast. Instead, it has become quite common in cognitive neuroscience studies to perform the main experiments with one specific sequence, while showing similar results (e.g. in the Supplementary) information with another sequence. This is usually done to control for expected vascula biases. E.g., the following list of studies used high-level cognitive neuroscience tasks with multiple sequence contrasts. -> Muckli 2015 (SE based GRASE and GE) -> Moerel 2018 (SE based GRASE and GE) -> Finn 2019 (VASO and GE) -> Zamboni 2020 (SE based GRASE and GE) -> Liu 2020 (SE based bSSFP and GE) The manuscript here seems to imply that those studies are not “typical”. This manuscript does not highlight the possibility that a collection of sequences might be advantageous for neuroscience experiments. As such, the manuscript does not acknowledge that the SS-SI VASO approach provides more than just a single CBV contrast. In fact, it also provides a GE BOLD contrast “for free”. This BOLD signal that is concomitantly acquired with VASO is not shown here. -> Maybe it would be helpful to judge SS-SI VASO not based on CBV alone. Just disregarding all the desired sensitivity in the second contrast appears quite inefficient to me. Maybe the SS-SI VASO sequence should be judged based on a combination of both provided contrasts. -> Maybe it would be helpful to include the BOLD signal of the SS-SI VASO sequence into the manuscript. This might also be helpful to address potential confounds of comparing 2D vs. 3D readouts? -> Maybe it would be appropriate to explicitly mention how the authors define a “typical cognitive neuroscience experiment” and maybe they can discuss how representative this definition is within the entire landscape of functional neuroimaging studies and layer-fMRI? In my humble understanding of ‘typical neuroscience’, I believe it is quite common in cognitive neuroscience to utilize a large umber of stimulation tasks. Most cognitive experiments combine the main task conditions with multiple ‘control’ task conditions. I do not understand why it should not be ‘typical’ to combine one main sequence contrast with additional control sequence. ### 3.) Concern about bias against VASO ### ##################################### In my opinion, the focus of the study and the phrasings are not really balanced. It appears to me that the interpretation and the summaries are tuned against VASO. -> Acquisition choices are different for VASO and BOLD that make VASO look worse than it is. As such, 2D-EPI and 3D-EPI are expected to have different sensitivities to physiological noise in superficial layers. This different physiological noise pattern is phrased as a weakness of VASO, while it might be a weakness of 3D readouts over 2D readouts? -> Analysis choices are different for VASO and BOLD that make VASO look worse than it is. E.g. shorter time periods are included in the analysis (on top of the already longer TRs for VASO). This is done despite the fact that VASO is known to have a slower HRF. When using less time points in VASO, it is not unexpected that is comed along with reduced statistical power. This choice makes VASO perform worse. -> A lack of a known ground truth activation profile is used to interpret any difference between sequences in favor of BOLD. There are few differences of layer-profiles between contrasts. Without established consensus in the field about which layer-profile is expected, the authors imply that VASO provides a wrong answer and the other contrasts provide a right answer. E.g., the different significance levels at superficial layers are interpreted as a false-negative in VASO rather than a false positive in SE-BOLD. -> The overall effects and layer-dependent modulations are very similar across contrasts. In the highlight section, this similarity is phrased as a proof for the usability of GE-BOLD. However, it could analogously be phrased as proof for the usability of VASO. -> Code development credit is given on analysis software and CMRR sequences, but not to the developers of VASO, nor to the developers of 3D-EPI. ### 4.) Concern about missing sequence details ### ########################################## Layer-fMRI is a relatively young field. There is no general consensus of how to optimize either of the tested sequences for a given application. While each acquisition parameter has huge implications on localization specificity and detection efficiency (sensitivity), the respective sequences are treated here rather as a ‘black box’. I think the generalizability claims of the conclusions in this study can be improved by including more details on the implementation and version number of the sequences compared here: -> The GE-EPI and SE-EPI sequences are described as CMRR-sequences with a reference to Moeller et al.,. Maybe it would be appropriate to mention the version number? -> It is not mentioned which MAGNETOM 7T scanner was used. The new “Terra MAGENTOM 7T”, or the “classical MAGNETOM 7T”? -> In order to give the chance to judge the magnitude of the T2’ contaminations, it would be helpful to explicitly state the echo train length. How long does it take for the EPI to get from the outermost k-space line to the k-space center? I believe that this is the single most important parameter that determines the T2’ contaminations and thus the SE-BOLD protocol's sensitivity. -> The VASO sequence is not accompanied by corresponding sequence developer credits, nor is it accompanied with a reference (like the other sequences). This suggests that it is developed by the authors. The code-avaliability statement declares that all the code will be made available and it is explicitly mentioned that the authors have an institutional agreement with SIEMENS. Thus, I would recommend the authors to include how the authors aim to share their sequence code. I am specifically mentioning this because I am (myself) an interested VASO user and would like to compare their sequence to my own. -> I am confused about the stated inversion time of 650ms in VASO. This is well below the blood nulling time. And it can be even below the GM-nulling time. As such short TIs, the VASO contrast can become positive (CBV increase comes along with a signal increase). Maybe the authors are confusing inversion time and inversion delay? Maybe the authors use a central acquisition ordering (not linear)? -> A flip angle of 26 degrees seems unconventionally large without the use of VFAs. It’s almost double the Ernst angle for such protocols. This is expected to significantly lower the sensitivity of VASO. Maybe this needs to be discussed, when judging the sensitivity of the VASO results. Maybe the authors did implement a VFA-approach and are just not mentioning it? -> The MP2RAGE and the VASO data are acquired with a 3D-EPI readout. It is not described which sequence baseline is used here. Given that Nikolas Weiskopf is in the author list, it remains to be assumed that it is a 3D-EPI baseline developed by Lutti et al (2013). I think it would be appropriate to give credit to the developer. Personally, I think it would be similarly appropriate to also acknowledge the first 3D-EPI MP2RAGE study by van der Zwaag (2018). Given the extremely short echo time and bandwidth in the 3D-EPI MP2RAGE, I think it would be appropriate to explicitly mention the segmentation factor of the 3D-EPI MP2RAGE. Was the 3D-EPI still distortion-matched? ### 5.) Concern about misalignment between discussion and abstract/conclusion ### #################################################################### In the discussion section, the authors state that their findings might be related to the fact that “the experimental regime {was} particularly suited for SE-BOLD”. Thus, the authors acknowledge the limited generalizability of their results. Yet still in the abstract and conclusion sections, the manuscript has general statements saying that SE-BOLD was favorable for typical cognitive neuroscience. ### 6.) Concern about contradiction with previous literature ### ################################################### There have been quite a few similar studies already that compared VASO, spin-echo based methods, and GE-BOLD within the same participants (Beckett 2020, Haenelt 2020, Huber 2017, Jin 2008). Unlike in this manuscript, none of these previous triple-contrast comparison studies recommends the usage of spin-echo based methods for neuroscience applications. These previous studies are not acknowledged here and the contradicting findings are not discussed. ### 7.) Concern about lacking ground truth layer profiles ### ################################################ One important difference between the manuscript at hand compared to previous studies is the usage of an employed neuroscience task without an established ground truth of an expected spatial activation signature across cortical depth. Here, the authors used a working memory orientation discrimination task to evoke feed-back activity. However, it is not clear if the feedback is expected predominantly in the deeper layers (as suggested by Kok et al) or if feedback is predominantly expected in superficial layers (as suggested by Muckli et al.). Thus, in light of a different layer-profile across contrasts, it is not clear which one is the right one. It is not clear if a different significance level in the superficial layers of VASO and SE-BOLD (a) is due to a false negative result in VASO or (b) if it is due to a false positive result in SE-BOLD. Here VASO does not find significant differences in the superficial layers and the authors interpret this as a false negative result. This interpretation is taken despite the fact that such a layer-profile is expected from Kok et al. Personally, I would consider the possibility that an unwanted T2’-related vein bias in SE-BOLD results in a false positive result in superficial layers. ### 8.) Concern about unclear effects of decoding analyses with novel sequence approaches ### ############################################################################## Decoding analyses are not very common in layer-fMRI. In non-GE BOLD sequences, it has never been used beyond exploratory purposes, I think. I have few concerns about potential mechanisms that might introduce biases with MVPA in layer-fMRI applications. -> In my humble understanding of MVPA, it is quite sensitive to both: (1) magnitude of the spatial signal patterns, and (2) magnitude of the noise. In layer-fMRI, each layer is expected to have a different noise level, and a different relative mixture of thermal noise and physiological noise. Thus, it is hard to interpret whether the different classification accuracy layer-profiles of the different sequences are dominated by actual brain information represented, or if they are rather dominated by the different sensitivity of physiological noise across cortical depth. Since the relationship of tSNR and classification accuracy is highly non-linear between chance-level and 100% accuracy, a straightforward subtraction analysis between task conditions is not viable. Maybe it would be appropriate to confirm that the tSNR profiles are the same across contrasts? -> In SS-SI VASO, the CBV time course is estimated by means of temporal interpolation of multiple surrounding control images. This means that information content is expected to be leaked across 2-3 neighboring time points (dependent on the temporal interpolation function). This might offset the baseline and significantly bias the results. Thus, MPVA might not be straightforwardly applicable on standard SS-SI VASO processing pipelines. Those standard pipelines have been solely optimized for univariate analyses. Alternative processing pipelines of TR-shifting across trials might be better suited (see Chaimow et al. https://layerfmri.com/baddi/). A further more suited MVPA-optimized VASO approach without temporal interpolation would be a non-SS-SI approach with multi-echo acquisition and in-plane segmentation. ### Conflict of interest statement ### ############################## My career is perceived to be connected to the VASO sequence. While I invest about 90% of my work hours on non-VASO related layer-fMRI topics, my reputation in the field is tightly coupled to the VASO contrast. Thus, it might hurt the perception of my reputation in the field if the VASO contrast is described to be inferior. I also want to disclose that I have changed my mindset about sequence comparison studies, along the course of the last decade. Nowadays, I am an opponent of sequence comparison studies. Though, in earlier stages of my career, I have regretfully wasted way too much time on it myself. ### References ### ################ Beckett AJS, Dadakova T, Townsend J, Huber L, Park S, Feinberg DA.

Thank you. I am a bit concerned by some of the logic employed throughout the paper though. Just because there is inconclusive data for the effect of spinal blockades on the perception of effort does not mean that an opposing model (corollary discharge model) is 'true'. A good example can be found in the conclusion:""Our results indicate that the group III-IV muscle afferents does not contribute as a signal processed by the brain to generate the perception of effort. Therefore, during voluntary movements, the perception of effort appears to be generated by the brain processing of the corollary discharge associated with the motor command"".

Understanding the dynamics by which microorganisms attach to and grow on particles is an important and contemporary field in microbial ecology, and in the understanding of the factors that influence the role of particle flux in the global carbon cycle. Szabo et al focus on the randomness of this process. By taking ~1000 identical chiton beads and incubating them in the sea-water from the same sample, and looking at the community structure 100 beads at a time, over the course of seven days, the authors aim to quantify how much variability there is in the microbial take-over of these particles. The authors applied shotgun metagenomics to each and every particle, focusing on assembling genomes into metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Several key findings stand out to me: 1) There is substantial variability over time in the microbial community structure, and on the number of microorganisms present per particle. 1a) The authors suggest that random variation in which bacteria attach to the particles and when they attach drives much of this variability. 2) There do not appear to be statistical associations between which microorganisms are on a given particle. That is if a given species “A” is common on particle A and not particle B, that has no bearing whatsoever on the abundance of any other microbe on either particle. 2a) Such a finding suggests that there are essentially no meaningful interactions between the microbes on the particles. Cross feeding, predation, symbiosis, chemical warfare, all believed to be important for microbial communities (Fuhrman and Steele 2008; Steele et al. 2011) would each be expected to lead to some sort of statistical association between organisms, but in this scenario at least such patterns are essentially absent. 3) The authors looked for contigs (partial phage genomes) and identified which appeared to “bin into the MAGs of their bacterial hosts”, suggesting that they were lysogenic with and therefore part of the genome of at least some members of that host. The more copies of this contig were present, the more active this phage was said to be. They found associations between the activity of these phages and the apparent growth of their hosts and negative associations between bacterial abundance and the presence of these phages. 3a) The authors suggest that stochastic absence of particular phages can lead to the situations where their hosts can rapidly take over a particle. I found this to be a very thought provoking manuscript and it raises a number of interesting and testable questions for future research. The sequencing and assembly of so many metagenomes, especially on very low biomass samples is an impressive technological feat (and clearly required diligent work on the part of the authors) which will be of value to the community at large. While some of my comments below are critical, I want to be clear that I was quite impressed with this paper and share these comments because I think the research is important and merits reflection. I have comments about each of the three main points listed above that I would like to share. I have not, as of yet, been asked to review this manuscript for any journal, but would be happy for any editor to use my comments. After preparing this review, I discussed it with Dr. Mina Bizic and she indicated that she shares my opinions. Dr. Bizic had several additional comments which she plans to make separately. Comment 1: On Stochasticity The authors make the case that there is randomness in the attachment and growth dynamics of microbial communities on particles. The authors suggest that because the variability between the communities on the particles is much higher than that of the surrounding water samples. However, I suspect that random variability in which rare taxa end up in each incubation could drive many of the patterns that they see. As context, in this experiment, chitinous beads (~80 micron diameter) are enclosed, one per well, in 96 well plates and incubated in, 175 ul of sea water. The microbes and particles have been concentrated in this small volume up to ten times by centrifugation. That is, volumes of whole sea-water were filtered, and then centrifuged and the bottom 1/10, presumably containing intact cells and small particles from the environment was retained. This means that each bead is incubated with essentially 1.75 ml of sea-water worth of microbes and microaggregates. I suspect that microbes that are adapted to degrading chitinous beads are scarce in the water, perhaps near or slightly below a concentration of 1 per 1.75ml. In this case, there could be random variability in whether chitin degrading microbes end up in any given well. Furthermore, a big driver in the randomness between which bacteria are in a well could be the presence of chitinous particles (smaller than the 60 micron filtration cutoff) in the background water. Ambient chitinous particles likely contain communities that would be adapted to break down chitinous beads. If one well happens to have one of these particles that particle is likely to come in contact with the bead near the beginning of the experiment in which case the microbes on the microaggregate can take over the bead. If such particles are absent, then perhaps the takeover of the bead doesn’t happen, or happens more slowly. Thus the stochastic process that drives the variability that the authors see may be in the starting community of the water in which the particle is incubated. If these organisms are rare, they would be likely to be missed by the sequencing, which can only sample the most abundant organisms. As they sequenced the seawater samples to a depth of ~500,000 reads per sample, and maintained about 25% of the samples (Table S5), this means that they essentially considered ~125,000  sequences per sample. Assuming the water had on the order of 1 million bacteria per ml, we might expect that any organism present at lower than ~10 copies per ml would likely be missed by their process. As there is an amplification step in their sequencing (supplementary methods) their method may even be less sensitive to rare organisms. Indeed, it is clear that the sequencing of the seawater didn’t catch every organism that could colonize the particles because per Table S7, some of the jackpot taxa (taxa that take over some particles) are either never seen or rarely seen in the seawater samples. Since they must have come from the seawater, it is clear that some species are missed by sequencing. Thus I contend that some of the particle to particle variability is likely from well to well variability in which microbes were stochastically placed in wells with each particle. On the other hand, it is possible that this stochasticity is environmentally relevant. For instance, an 80 micron bead that sinks through 100 m of the water column only clears a total volume of ~500 μl {π(80 μm / 2) ^2 * 100 m = 503 μl} and so it is possible that microbes beyond this abundance in water would actually be unlikely to encounter a particle as it sinks out of the photic zone, for instance. Comment 2: On interactions I’m surprised that there don’t seem to be interactions between organisms, but their graphical lasso based statistics seem reasonable to me. I’m furthermore surprised the authors did not seem to consider Bižić-Ionescu et al. (2018)’s paper, which has a very complementary design to this paper, but seemed to find the opposite pattern with respect to microbial interactions. Bižić-Ionescu et al. (2018) presented a very similar project, in which the authors also had replicate particles, though fewer than in the paper by Szabo et al. Key differences were that the authors used a flow-through rolling tank which exposed the particles to more water, and that those authors used (larger) aggregates of algae rather than chitinous beads as their particles. Bižić-Ionescu et al. did not quantify the variability in microbial abundance and so would not have seen the abundance dynamics that Szabo et al. saw, if they had occurred. Like Szabo et al. (this manuscript), they suggested that differences in the timing of microbial colonization of particles drive a lot of the particle-to-particle variability. Bižić-Ionescu et al. also saw statistical patterns that suggested interactions, as well as expression of genes for microbial interactions, including antagonistic processes.  I hope the authors will consider the possible differences between the two systems and why those might lead to different dynamics, and what that says about the robustness and environmental realism of the patterns seen in both experiments. Comment 3: On viral contigs and non-assembled microbes The authors consider viruses that bin into MAGs which I presume means that they are often or always part of the microbial genome of a particular organism. I am not an expert on this process, but it seems to me a reasonable way of assigning viruses to hosts. I note that other validated tools for metagenomic host assignment are also available (Zielezinski et al. 2021). I presume there are many viral contigs that did not bin to a specific MAG. Why did the authors choose to ignore these? Similarly the authors focus only on those species that assemble into MAGs, I presume there is a bunch of microbial diversity that doesn’t assemble (since my impression is that in most communities not all sequenced contigs end up as part of a MAG). Could the authors expand on why they chose to ignore this diversity, and what impacts on their analysis only looking at assembled bacteria and not the rest of the microbial diversity might have on the analysis. I thank the authors for sharing this pre-print in a public forum and encourage them to consider these comments. Sincerely, Jacob Cram References Bižić-Ionescu M, Ionescu D, Grossart H-P.

Review of Paunov et al. https://www.biorxiv.org/con... The authors identify that the study of language and theory of mind (ToM) processing has been conducted, for the most part, independently in laboratory settings, leaving questions for dependencies between these systems in more naturalistic settings. They ask: do language and ToM neural networks dissociate even in response to naturalistic stimuli, which have varying levels of ToM and language content? General evaluation: Key strengths of this paper are: 1) the use of naturalistic stimuli that are rich with theory of mind and language content to study the functional dissociation between ToM-Language networks, and 2) the methodology – a combination of individual-specific functional localization and inter-subject correlation (ISC) – that minimizes reverse and non-specific inference based on anatomical locations only. Inclusion of resting state ISC to ensure that the task-based ISC are not the result of data acquisition, preprocessing, or modeling procedures add to their interpretation of results. That said, 1) nuanced discussions of conflicting key data in the context of their paradigms, and 2) additional whole-brain level ISC analyses given the limitations of using ISC in inferring dissociability of ToM and language networks could substantially increase the value of this paper to the field. Major comments: 1.	Please further qualify the interpretations of “functional dissociability” between language and ToM networks in the context of the posed question and used paradigm. A major conclusion from the experiment is that there was indeed dissociability between language and ToM neural networks, albeit incomplete, even under naturalistic stimuli rich with social contexts. However, as the authors reviewed thoroughly in the introduction and Figure 1, cognitive demands on ToM processing may come from heterogenous contexts, i.e. mental state inference and mental state content comprehension. Since their objective was to evaluate differential recruitment of language-ToM networks in processing the latter, and the ToM localizer task they used specified regions involved in comprehension of mental state content that are linguistically presented (Figure 2), their main ToM neural results supporting network dissociation need to be interpreted from that methodology. For example, can you use the ToM activity in condition “-Language +ToM” (where regions were selected by language-based ToM localizer task) as evidence for mental state content comprehension, when the stimuli themselves were presented non-linguistically? It could have instead represented the process of mental state inference, which is not what the authors aimed to measure. How do you interpret left TPJ, which exhibits weak but significantly above-baseline tracking of the expository text (“+Language -ToM”); could it be that the participants were inferring what these expository words mean using higher order processes, and that ISC is measuring this common internal process, even though there is no ToM content to track (the original purpose of this task)? Even though the authors discuss generally that naturalistic stimuli such as those used in this paradigm may require fundamentally increased combination of ToM and language network interaction as well as heterogenous ToM context processing (inference/comprehension), qualifying interpretations of currently conflicting neural data by returning to their originally stated research goal will add concrete insights into the nature of “functional dissociability” under real-life conditions. 2.	Please provide results in the control regions that are not supposed to be involved in language or ToM across the modalities of stimuli presentation. Ideally, authors can also provide whole-brain maps of ISC during the tasks, as these would provide a more comprehensive picture of inter-network differences and similarities underlying critical ISC results, which are currently grounds for supporting ToM-language dissociation. As the authors acknowledge in Line 851-855 and 947-948, ISC can be driven by anything that is consistent across participants at the time of doing the tasks, not necessarily reflecting language or ToM-related processing (Nastase et al., SCAN 2019). For example, the ToM network overlaps with the default mode network, which becomes more active when participants are reflecting and directing attention internally. The stimuli may have had varying levels of engagingness and subjectively meaningful processing. In other words, with the current datasets we don’t really know if the domains that the authors were interested in drove ISC. By contrast, some regions that are more idiosyncratic (e.g. less stimulus driven) could have been crucially involved in processing ToM content, perhaps suggesting that lower ISC (e.g. RH PCC/precuneus in dialog condition) in fact was a false negative in that ROI. 3.	Signal-to-noise-ratio may be stronger in certain ROIs than others, leading to differences in ISC. Please provide some correction or normalization of this to qualify the validity of the results comparing ROIs. Minor comments: 4.	If they have this information, in 2.3 Participants, another exclusionary criterion should be impairment of ToM or language network either from neurological or psychiatric conditions. 5.	Authors found in reality check #1 experiment that these individuals’ auditory and visual cortex activity were also not completely dissociated and crossed over to track visual and auditory stimuli, respectively during active task performance. I would like to hear the interpretations of these results with regard to the main results. 6.	Authors conducted multiple demand network analysis as part of the replication analysis – please (if it does) explain how this adds to their conclusion/results of this paper. 7.	In Line 1043, be more specific how methodology enhanced with temporal resolutions (MEG, intracranial recording) could be better for investigating mechanism of ToM-language network interaction?",2021-12-23T21:29:42,,Anonymous Peer Reviewer,10.1101/2021.04.28.441724,Differential tracking of linguistic vs. mental state content in naturalistic stimuli by language and Theory of Mind (ToM) brain networks,"Alexander M.

I do have some concerns about the sensitivity/specificity values stated in the paper, though - and their implications for the evidential weight provided by the models you test. The true-positive, false-negative etc numbers making up the 2x2 contingency tables are pretty small, making normality assumptions unreliable. Best practice in such cases is to use Wilson's method (see eg Altman et al 2000 ""Statistics with confidence"" Ch 10). This  leads to point estimates and upper/lower 95% intervals for the sensitivity somewhat different than those in Table 5a/b. My principal concern, though, is about the specificity, which is stated to be 100%. Given that your study is based on a (small) sample, one really should reflect the uncertainty surrounding the values. Applying Wilson's method leads to typical point estimates for the specificity of around 72%. The upper bound is 100%, but the lower bound is typically around 44%. Combined with the sensitivity data, this suggest the positive Likelihood Ratio for the various models to be around 2 or so - somewhat less than the infinite value implied by taking the specificity to be 100%, as stated in the table!

General Remarks Overall, all of us enjoyed reading the manuscript. The writing was excellent and it inspired some interesting discussions among us. We definitely want to see this paper published in some form! At times we had the idea that this could also be a technical note focusing on the methodological challenges. Additional: •	Comprehensive Introduction (however, it reads more like a review, some found it too lengthy) •	Very nice figures •	Great points in the discussion (e.g., object permanence in real world vs. lab experiments) Major Issues Our main issue was with the tablet condition. First, you argue to employ a scalable experimental design. But why only choose the two extremes ends of the spectrum and not use some middle ground? Maybe a more controlled tablet condition where participants also scroll and search for books? Second, the tablet condition was in general not a good control for us. Why did you not use a more comparable visual search task in the tablet condition? •	Are you really sure that some of the problems are not simply due to technical issues? Some more information/evidence on how you conducted e.g. timing tests could be relevant •	Section 3.5.2 on ERP latency does not make sense to us, this latency is manufactured and hence arbitrary. •	We do not understand 4C properly. What do we see here? A more detailed explanation is necessary. •	Why manual labeling of fixations (should be better explained)? Could this be automatized? •	Removing more than 40% of the ICA component seem excessive. It was unclear to us whether those are only eye and heart rate related components ? •	We expect that people titled their head left and right to read the titles on the back of the book. Did this have an effect on the EEG quality, to you have information about head movements? •	As far as we understand you have eye tracking information for both task. To us it seems logical to apply the same analysis pipeline you used for the library task for the tablet condition as well (i.e. define gaze fixations and epoch according to these, also you can apply the template matching approach to the tablet condition to see how this changes the data.) •	We believe that a visual search task would be the better control condition. In general the entire visual search literature seems to be very relevant here but is not extensively discussed. Minor Issues •	In the pre-processing, you state that you use 300ms to 500ms to quantify the P3. However, anywhere else in the MS you highlight the window from 250ms to 500ms. •	What is the height of the people? - “eye-level” - some participants are taller than others - was that controlled for somehow? (not sure whether this is relevant but it might be.) •	How was the library prepared? Was it closed off the other people? Did you make sure the target books were always there? •	Re-referencing: Did you re-reference the data or simply remove the mastoids? It was unclear to us the way it is written. •	Scanlon et al. (2017) is a paper about comparing an oddball task between sitting and pedalling on a stationary bike inside. It seems like you meant to cite: •	Scanlon, J. E., Townsend, K. A., Cormier, D.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.12.443801v1#comment-5653922412,biorxivstage,3,"The manuscript by Nies et al. demonstrates how changing pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) parameters can affect non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and photosystem II yield (ՓPSII). Using in silico simulations of PAM experiments, the authors illustrate how NPQ and ՓPSII are affected by varying: i) the delay between measurement of maximal fluorescence Fm and the onset of the actinic light (or between turning off AL and measurement of Fm’’ in the dark), ii) the intensity of the actinic light, iii) the frequency of the saturating pulses, iv) and their duration. Nies et al. finish by validating their in silico model, and suggesting that scientists using PAM must provide the details of all of the parameters listed above in the methods section of any publications to allow their experiments to be accurately reproduced and modeled. We enjoyed this manuscript, however, we have some comments and suggestions for improvement, listed below. Major comments - We suggest moving part of the model validation section of the results, shown in Figures 8 (and 9), to the start of the manuscript. This rearrangement would show the reader that the mathematical model used in the in silico simulations can accurately reproduce experimental data, before the parameter-dependent changes to NPQ and ՓPSII are simulated. In the current arrangement, the reader needs to have prior knowledge that the changes in NPQ and ՓPSII shown in the simulations are accurate, before the herein updated model has been validated. - Fig8. Regarding the validation of the mathematical model by comparing to experimental PAM measurements with different SP durations, or different delays of AL onset from Fm measurement, with the simulated data: what is the rationale for choosing these, how about testing the other parameters such as AL intensity and frequency of SP? Please comment on the impact of the different parameters on e.g. the NPQ measurement and rank them by stronger to lower effect based on your simulations and experiments. Also a historical perspective/physiological relevance of delaying the SP from actinic onset would be welcome! How about giving recommendation to researchers in the field to have Fm determination/SP right at onset of illumination, with no delay, to prevent further confusion (and similarly have the final SP in AL on, followed by AL off with no delay). - Line 326. Regarding the use of another model of photosynthesis, we found this very interesting and suggest that a comparison of the simulations generated by the two mathematical models using the same set of parameters be included as a main or supplemental figure, and its description be included in the results section. The GitLab link (line 330) doesn’t specify which exact file to look at. - Line 127. “We have used 500 µmol s−1 m−2 as the default light intensity of AL.” For simulations, an intensity of 500 µmol m−2 s−1 was used, but for experiments (line 152) “The intensity of red AL was set at approx. 457 µmol m−2 s−1”. We understand that matching the actinic light during the experiment to 500 µmol m−2s−1 cannot be possible, alternatively we suggest that the simulations be carried out at 457 µmol m−2 s−1 for sake of consistency. Importantly, is 457 µmol m−2 s−1 the value given by the manufacturer for the chosen setting, and did you measure it to confirm its value? (depending on instrument calibration, usage and age, the light output can be different than set) - Line 204, 205. “The calculated steady-state NPQ values are higher for SP intensities below 3000 µmol s−1 m−2”, according to Fig.5, it seems that the threshold is rather 2000, than 3000 (or 4000). - Fig7. To test the “actinic effect” of SP duration, we would suggest to perform a simulation with AL=100 µmol m−2 s−1 AL and/or AL=0 to check whether SP themselves can induce NPQ. According to Fig8A (experimental), it seems that at 0.8s, NPQ is indeed slightly higher than with shorter SP duration. - Line 370, a necessary addition would be to list here, or write a template of, what you suggest for minimum information is needed as standard for the community. It could be similar to Table 2, and needs to include duration of AL on, off and AL quality. Minor comments - Line 46. “Allow”, should be “allows” - Line 75. “Groups but also” should be “groups experimentally, but also” - Line 115. Replace higher by vascular. - Line 140. 26C is higher than standard temperature for Arabidopsis growth (22C), what’s the rationale for choosing this temperature? - Line 150. Define Fv and explain if the 5s of far red light is turned on at the very beginning of the experiment i.e. before time 0. - Line 153. “default settings (10)”, specify “set at value of” 10. We suggest writing a small table with these parameters (see major comment). - Line 161. Which leaf did you choose, younger or older? This information is important to state, see differences with leaf age for example in Bielczynski et al. Plant Phys (2017) doi: 10.1104/pp.17.00904. - Line 173-174. We suggest that the SP time points are moved to the methods section. - Line 185-186. “In the upper panel….derived NPQ and ՓPSII”, this whole sentence can be removed as it should be clear from the figure legend. - Line 211. “Far more” how many did you look at? - Fig. 6. “6A and 6A”. Should be “6A and 6B” - Line 234. “Switching on AL with the first SP in light-triggered after 1 s” suggest rewording as it was unclear what light-triggered means. - Line 241. The observed effect is likely due to the total conversion of zeaxanthin to violaxanthin for long periods of dark-adaptation. - Line 243. Suggest changing “whereas” should be “however” as it is clearer. - Line 256. Define PMST. - Line 264-268. We suggest moving this block of text to the discussion section. - Line 264. “AL is another important information” should be “AL is another important piece of information” - Fig. 8B and 8D. As the simulated curves seem to all overlap, and often in this study we look for fine nuances between data, we think it would be beneficial to read the simulated curve superimposed on top of the experimental data allowing a fair comparison and analysis between the two types of data. Displaying the same graphs at a larger scale would help to read them. To help in this, we propose Figure 8 to be divided in two figures, since Fig. 8A-D is related to “SP experiment” while Fig. 8E-H is related to the “delay experiment”. This would allow the size of the panels to be increased to help the reader interpret the data. - Fig. 8F and 8H. Plot titles “Delay NPQ/ՓPSII Sim lation”, should be “Delay NPQ/ՓPSII Simulation” - Fig. 9 seems to be redundant as the reader should be able to observe the difference between the two independent experiments by comparing Figure 8A and 8E. We therefore suggest that Fig. 9 be removed. - Line 286. “Measurements are” should be “measurements have been” - Line 289-303. We suggest moving this block of text to the introduction section - Line 324. Replace “many” by “all”! - Line 351. “Agreements” should be “agreement” - Line 361-372. We feel that the points made in this block of text have already been made earlier in the manuscript and repeated several times. Therefore this block of text can probably be omitted as it is redundant. - General comments concerning the figures: we suggest adding dark/light bars to the top of most plots in Figures 3B-C, 4B-C, 6A-D, 7A-B, 8A-H; as it would improve the readability/interpretation of the plotted data. Fig. 2-8, figure identifier letters are presented in a different font style than the rest of the text, throughout the document.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.20.461005v1#comment-5653195920,biorxivstage,2,"The manuscript by Swaffer et al. is a very interesting paper that demonstrates for the first time that the RNA pol II complex is the limiting factor for transcription rate of protein-coding genes. This is an important new finding that, although suspected by previous researchers, was not studied in any organism (to our knowledge). Another important result is the finding that about 50% of the RNA pol II molecules are bound to chromatin. This confirms previous studies made by different laboratories that found a significant part of the RNA pol II not to be actively transcribing (Struhl 2007; Borggrefe et al. 2001; discussed in Pelechano et al., 2010). The fact that not all (or most) RNA pol II molecules are not bound to chromatin, however, does not affect the models that assume that the strong affinity constant of this RNA pol for their targets is what causes an increase in the number of elongating RNA pol II. This increase will be reflected in nascent transcription rate (nTR, see Pérez-Ortín et al 2013 for a detailed discussion) with cell volume increase (Lin and Amir, 2018; Marguerat and Bahler, 2012; Padovan-Merhar et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2020; Zhurinsky et al., 2010; Mena et al., 2017). This is because if the binding depends on the general mass action equilibrium, as Swaffer et al. propose, the increase in nTR will still occur even with 50% of the RNA pol II molecules unbound to chromatin. The key reason is that the number of RNA pol II molecules per cell does not increase in proportion to cell volume, but less than that. This is another important result described in Swaffer et al.: RNA pol II concentration decreases with cell volume. This result, however, was already demonstrated four years ago by our group (Mena et al. 2017) although is not cited by Swaffer et al. The difference between our results and those of Swaffer et al. is that we found no increase at all in RNA pol II molecules per cell within the range of cell volumes studied, whereas Swaffer et al. found that there is an increase but less than required for scaling. That difference is striking because we demonstrated that nTR does not scales at all with cell size (Mena et al., 2017) in 5 different circumstances: two meta-analysis of published data from P. Cramer group; after α-factor release in synchronized cultures; by western blot of Ser2-phosphorylated Rpb1; and using a set of cell size mutants that include whi5 and cln3 similarly to those used by Swaffer et al. For our analyses we utilized data obtained with different techniques (cDTA, GRO, western blot) and different physiological situations of cell size change. The data from Swaffer et al. also come from various different experimental setups. We have no explanation for this discrepancy. However, the results from Swaffer et al. lack explanation for two important questions: the reason for the decrease in RNA pol II concentration and the ultimate reason for this apparently abnormal behavior of S. cerevisiae cells. In our publication (Mena et al. 2017) we answered those two questions. The decrease in RNA pol II concentration is due to a particular behavior of the mRNAs that encode for their main subunits (Rpb1,2,3). On the contrary to the rest of the transcriptome (see below) these mRNAs that maintain their nTR (as most of the others) do not suffer a compensatory stabilization: they are outside of the feedback mechanism argued by Swaffer et al. The global mRNA stabilization feedback mechanism was also demonstrated by us in our 2017 paper (Mena et al., 2017). This is again a satisfactory coincidence with Swaffer et al. results but was, again, not cited in their manuscript. Finally, but very importantly, the reason for the abnormal behavior of S. cerevisiae that seems to behave differently from other eukaryotes studied (Marguerat and Bahler, 2012; Padovan-Merhar et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2020; Zhurinsky et al., 2010) is that it is a budding yeast. That is, it divides asymmetrically. As we shown in our study (Mena et al, 2017) the models based in an increase in nTR with cell volume to keep the production of mRNAs (synthesis rate) constant  predict a never ending increasing mRNA synthesis rate in smaller daughter cells along the successive generations. This is a key conceptual problem. We developed a model (scenario #3 in Mena et al., 2017) that seems to be partially similar to the dynamic equilibrium model of Swaffer et al. in the sense that both assume that RNA pol II concentration decreases with cell volume. However, there is a very important difference between the two models. If the decrease in RNA pol II concentration were not strictly inverse to the cell size increase (i.e. constant nTR for RNA pol II-encoding genes) the conceptual problem would not be solved. Only a perfect maintenance of nascent transcription rates for RNA pol II-encoding genes would solve the asymmetric cell division problem. A corollary of this discussion is that perhaps the results of Swaffer et al. presented as a general model for eukaryote RNA polymerase II dynamics with cell size are only valid for budding yeasts given that the previous publications on the limiting factor model referred to symmetrically dividing cells.

We hope that they will find the following comments relevant. The impact on pain-like responses of the contextual paradigm described herein, whereby acetic acid is injected intraperitoneally and hind paw withdrawal responses are measured, is attributed to either ‘classical referred pain mechanisms (i.e., sensitization of spinal cord projection neurons receiving information from both the foot and the viscera), or to the recently described ‘anti-diffuse noxious inhibitory control (anti-DNIC)’ phenomenon in which pain in one region of the body increases pain in another anatomically distinct region’. We firstly note that these two explanations are incongruous; visceral inputs converge onto the same lumbosacral pathways as hindpaw cutaneous inputs and it is likely that the impact on pain-like responses observed is influenced by secondary hyperalgesia (itself is likely subjected to descending modulation, although this has not been investigated here). We secondly note that DNIC, since it’s description by Le Bars et al., is defined as a neurophysiological measure where two distant noxious stimuli recruit a distinct descending inhibitory pathway and supresses spinal neuronal excitability (i.e., it cannot be explained by intrasegmental mechanisms but is heterotopically/heterosegmentally recruited). Thus, not all descending modulation is DNIC. Indeed, the descending pain modulatory system (DPMS) encompasses multiple parallel yet distinct circuits (anatomically and pharmacologically speaking) including placebo analgesia, offset analgesia/onset hyperalgesia, attentional analgesia, stress-induced analgesia/hyperalgesia, DNIC and others. Therefore, we feel strongly that the contextual hypoalgesia or hyperalgesia that you observe upon application of your paradigm in wakeful animals is not the equivalent of DNIC or ‘anti-DNIC’ but rather is likely dependent on activity within a separate discrete descending circuit. We passionately believe that nomenclature matters when ascribing a mechanism to an observation as this clarity is a necessity in moving the field forward - descending control of nociception was recently introduced as a term to help draw a distinction from reflexive endpoints in awake animals and the neurophysiological correlates in anaesthetised preparations. These separate terminologies importantly help highlight differences between non-comparable endpoints but also the partially overlapping underlying mechanisms being studied. We hope that our comments are taken in the spirit that they are intended. We believe that commonality in terminology is a first vital step towards understanding the mechanisms that underlie the complex pain-like behaviours that we measure in wakeful animals upon application of varied paradigms.

We thank them for the constructive discussion on their highly impactful result. It is correct that the crystal structure of NTSR1-H4 has a 0.07-Å higher resolution than that of NTSR1-H4bm (2.64 vs. 2.71 Å). However, the structure of NTSR1-H4bm is more native, less affected by crystallization effects (TM1, ECL2, intracellular position of TM7), and its electron density is of higher quality in several key regions (e.g., ligand, ECL3, ligand-binding site including for instance F344 and Y347). Since one of the aims of the current manuscript is to compare the crystallographic and cryo-EM approaches, we believe that the structure of NTSR1-H4bm should be considered at least equally important as that of NTSR1-H4 for a fair comparison with the cryo-EM complex in the revised manuscript. As the coordinates of the cryo-EM complex are not publicly available yet, we cannot comment with absolute precision on the differences between the cryo-EM complex and the crystal structure of NTSR1-H4bm. However, the differences are certainly fewer and smaller compared to NTSR1-H4 (including for residues R6.54 and R6.55, which are directly affected by stabilizing mutations in NTSR1-H4 but not in NTSR1-H4bm). Of course, the cryo-EM complex undoubtedly represents a remarkable advancement and overcomes several limitations of the crystal structures. Regarding the electron density for the ligand, we agree that  2Fo−Fc maps can be evaluated at different contour levels, including sigma=1.25. However, we believe that the current panel in Fig. 2b suggests that insufficient electron density was observed to unambiguously model the ligand, as part of the chloroquinoline ring of SR48692 is not resolved in the map at that particular contour level. This ligand moiety is, however, better resolved at a typical sigma=1.0. Notably, the 2Fo−Fc map of NTSR1-H4bm is of higher quality, and it features the entire chloroquinoline ring of SR48692 even at higher sigma levels, including sigma=1.25, while no merging of density between ligand and protein is observed until very low contour levels. (As a side note, to prevent model bias, in both structures the ligand was actually fitted into the Fo−Fc map (not 2Fo−Fc), which was computed when only the protein and solvent had been modeled. To prevent “human” bias, the rhofit software from Global Phasing was used).",2021-12-20T11:21:56,mattiadeluigi,Mattia Deluigi,10.1101/2021.11.02.466983,Structure Determination of Inactive-State GPCRs with a Universal Nanobody,"Michael J.

The key findings are that the amount of actin recruited to pits does not seem to correspond to the maturity of the pits, that the actin network likely grows both laterally and inward from the base of pits, and that actin seems to counteract membrane tension. The imaging is interesting and the super-resolution view of clathrin coated pits are nice. The manuscript also presents evidence that Arp2/3 activity assists pit completion, as CK666 causes longer clathrin lifetimes. The later data about clathrin coat height and actin height are less convincing, because it is unclear whether these results are from multiple rounds of treatment or from one experiment. The authors could strengthen their manuscript by bolstering those later results (in Figs 3-4). The authors claim that Arp2/3 inhibition has the opposite effect when under membrane tension than it does under isotonic conditions. This is very intriguing, but a reader cannot tell if the results are replicated sufficiently to support the claim. How many biological replicates are reported in Fig 3H? In other words, how many times was a sample exposed to the treatment (e.g. CK666)?

The works published in this sense discuss the presence of only one virus already known to infect triatomines of the genus Triatoma infestans, called Triatoma virus. Therefore, this research aimed to investigate the composition of the Rhodnius prolixus viroma, which is totally unknown, in order to elucidate the insect-virus relationship and understand possible impacts of viral infections on the life cycle of these triatomines. Furthermore, the authors discussed the antiviral system of these insects and proposed the use of RNA interference (RNAi) as a tool in vector control strategies. As a result, the authors identified 7 new (+)ssRNA viruses in R. prolixus, labeled Rhodnius prolixus Virus 1-7 (RpV1-7), and observed that these RpVs are vertically transmitted from females to offspring. Furthermore, a system, active during the oogenesis of R. prolixus, that uses RNAi to protect the germline and embryos of this insect from viral infections has been reported. In this way, RpVs are able to maintain persistent and systemic infections without causing damage to the host, due to a reduction in the viral load. Overall, the work has an interesting study proposal, as it can contribute to a better understanding of the microbiota present in triatomines, how its transmission occurs, and raises questions about its importance and possible vector control strategies for Chagas disease. However, I would like to highlight some items that can be seen as limitations and propose suggestions for the authors to analyze. Major comments: 1) At the end of the Results, it was not clear to me whether the RNAi machinery of the adult females was transferred to the eggs or if they, through this machinery, produced dsRNA against the viral sequences and deposited them in the mature eggs (page 16). 2) In the discussion, the possibility of influences on the insect's vectorial capacity and possible implications for its reproduction in the presence of these viruses could be addressed. Are these viruses essential for oogenesis to occur correctly? How does the absence or presence of these viruses impact the biology and physiology of the insect? These questions were raised in order to understand the real importance of the presence of these viruses in R. prolixus. 3) When analyzing other works on virus detection in triatomines, I noticed that all of them conducted their experiments based on the purification of viral particles from insect samples (stool and intestinal contents, for example) ( https://doi.org/10.1590/S00..., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.j..., http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.... Furthermore, in some of them, detection of the viral particle was performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ( https://doi.org/10.1099/002.... As in this work the analyzes were performed based only on RNA transcriptomes, I believe it would be interesting to confirm the presence of these viruses in insects by identifying their viral particles, and not just their RNA sequences. Minor comments: 1) I would suggest the authors to reorganize the ideas in the introduction to ensure continuity of the subject to be covered. As it's written, the ideas seem to be out of order. I suggest the following construction: introduce the triatomines and medical relevance, R. prolixus and its oogenesis, host/virus interaction, antiviral defense by RNAi, objectives and previous results. 2) Orthography should be corrected in the first paragraph of Materials and Methods, page 20: “Previtello e genic stages and...” 3) I consider that Figure 1A is unrelated to Figures 1B-E and its title “Phylogenetic analysis of the R. prolixus viruses”. I suggest that this figure be placed separately from the others, keeping as title its explanatory sentence “Schematic of an ovariole in R. prolixus ”.",2021-12-15T14:53:46,disqus_fVITe2Cuqd,Albaniza L R do Nascimento,10.1101/2020.10.18.344325,Transovarial transmission fuels persistent infections of a core virome in the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius prolixus,"Tarcísio Fontenele de Brito, Vitor Lima Coelho, Maira Arruda Cardoso, Ingrid Alexandre de Abreu Brito, Fides Lea Zenk, Nicola Iovino, Attilio Pane",2020-10-18

I am aware of several SECONDARY sources indicating the configuration as in this paper and there is confusion even in SciFinder!

As the authors can understand, the point of this manuscript is not to extensively characterize the pharmacology of the neurotensin receptor, which was covered excellently in the manuscript published by themselves; indeed, NTSR is only one of the three structures described in the preprinted form of the manuscript. We chose to compare the NSTR1 cryoEM structure with the reported higher resolution crystal structure in an effort to both highlight the strength of crystallography as well as the advance of our cryoEM method. We will provide additional description of the other structure with less mutagenesis in a revised version of the manuscript. However we disagree with the suggestion that our work is misleading or downplays the crystallographic work: First, the majority of the differences noted in the manuscript do not involve thermostabilizing mutations but rather either the DARPin (NPXXY motif), rat vs human (ECL3), and/or some combination of crystal packing and flexibility (TM1, ECL1). These effects are largely consistent with both structures, as we have considered both. Further, as the commenters have noted, some of these effects can be attributed to flexibility, alternative states, or other factors and thus are not necessarily ‘wrong’ in the crystal structure, which is why we have carefully avoided such language and instead chose to highlight these as differences. In cases where this may have been ambiguous, we have clarified the language. Second, the readjustment of R6.54 and R6.55 compared to the cryoEM structure, which we suggest likely involves 7.42 in this particular structure, does change somewhat in the back-mutated structure. However, while rearranged, there are still appreciable differences in the positions of R6.54 and R6.55 between the back-mutated and cryoEM structure that would seem to still preclude or at least modulate the binding of the water molecule consistent with the feature in the cryoEM map, and likely results from other changes in the receptor, for example a change in conformation of W321. We will add an additional panel and discussion of these differences in the revised version of the manuscript, but the point that this feature is indeed different in the cryoEM structure applies to both crystal structures and thus we feel is not misleading. To the second point, we don’t believe that we suggested that the pose of the ligand is in any way ambiguous in the crystal structures as it is not. We will certainly make sure to highlight this in the revised version. However, we would disagree with the assertion that the 2Fo-Fc map can only be considered at a sigma of 1.0; as sigma is a measure of standard deviations in the signal in the map. We felt like 1.25 sigma was the most flattering contour at which to visualize the ligand in the map attached to the 2.6 A structure, as at 1.0 sigma there was some merging of density between the ligand and TM6. We will however add additional panels into the manuscript highlighting the ligand at alternative contours with both crystallographic structures.

The results suggest that supplementation with quercetin, via gavage, exerts beneficial effects on lipid and glucose metabolism, modulating antioxidant enzymes, insulin signaling and secretion in hypertensive animals. Furthermore, the use of quercetin positively interfered with systemic blood pressure, reducing it and reversing the renal hypertrophic effect caused by the induced stenosis of the left renal artery in 2K1C rats. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and enzymatic modulating roles played by quercetin have already been described in experimental models of obesity and diabetes, and the investigation of insulin signaling in a model of renovascular hypertension is the gap that the article aims to fill. Although the results are promising and based on the scientific literature, the experiments carried out were not able to delimit which pathway quercetin interferes with the homeostasis of pancreatic islets. I believe the cause-and-consequence relationships were not well designed and therefore the results do not tell a linear story. Therefore, some methodological and literature-related limitations will be pointed out. 1) The relationship between insulin secretion, action and signaling in a model of renovascular hypertension was not adequately correlated at the beginning of the introduction (page 3). Perhaps bringing data from experiments with humans, located at the beginning of the discussion (page 9), and, if applicable, showing the modulated signaling pathway(s), would better corroborate the correlation proposed by the authors. Furthermore, in the introduction, angiotensin II is frequently mentioned and generates expectations that it will be investigated during the study, which is not the case. As hypertension, in the renovascular case, the focus of the work, is a secondary disease resulting from a primary metabolic disorder, the association with insulin metabolism and signaling should have been better developed, citing, for example, the role of the kidneys in homeostasis of glucose; 2) The chemical structure of flavonoids determines their antioxidant action, therefore, the choice of quercetin specifically, and not any other flavonoid, as the object of study was not argued. Physicochemical parameters intrinsic to the molecule should be evaluated, such as the formation and identification of metabolites and solubilization. Furthermore, as this is an in vivo animal model, pharmacodynamic parameters – absorption, distribution, metabolization and excretion – must be considered in order to determine the causal effect of the administration of the molecule in question; 3) The absence of the Sham group (false operated) exposed to quercetin impairs the analysis of the results of the other groups and the effect of quercetin in the proposed model. Furthermore, as this is a metabolic investigation in animals, the type of food provided (type, brand, etc.) must be detailed; 4) Regarding the administration of quercetin, it is necessary to present the acceptable daily consumption rate of this flavonoid, so that the meaningfulness of the results takes into account the level (low, intermediate, acceptable or supraphysiological) of intake presented and the reason for choosing such dosage (50 mg/kg/day). Thus, it would be fundamental to present a concentration-response curve (using lower and higher concentrations than the one tested, at least in Figure 1, items “b”, “d” and “g”); 5) Regarding the preprint formatting, the fact that the figures and the text clash makes the reading less dynamic; 6) It would be interesting to illustrate, with photographs, the kidneys (left and right) of each animal group, in order to verify their appearance and not just the mass (figure 1, item “d”); 7) Considering that the effect on energy metabolism is the focus of the work, the investigation of lipolytic (PPARα, AGTL) and lipogenic (LXR, SREBP1c) pathways could have been considered to better conclude the work. Likewise, the activity of isolated enzymes could have been evaluated in vitro in order to better consolidate the enzymatic modulation of quercetin in the experimental model in question; 8) Many of the Western Blottings (figures 4 and 5) present smear and low quality, thus clashing with the graphic results due to the variability, mainly in figure 4, items “a”, “f” and “h”, which hinders the final conclusion of the article. The inclusion of the uncropped gels in a supplementary material would help with this problem. 9) Part of figure 5 seems to be loose in the article, for example, in the text there is scarce contextualization and scientific validation for the investigation of muscarinic receptors M1 and M3; 10)The relationship between the antioxidant effect promoted by quercetin in adipose tissue cannot be directly related to the expression of SOD-2 and catalase enzymes; 11)It would be interesting to evaluate the modulation of quercetin in apoptosis and inflammation pathways, for example, to relate the possible protective effect to pancreatic islets;",2021-12-13T14:31:41,hellenmarianne,Hellen Marianne,10.1101/2021.09.10.459841,Quercetin prevents insulin dysfunction in hypertensive animals,"Cristiane Alves Serra, Alexandre Freire dos Reis, Bruno Calsa, Cintia Sena Bueno, Júlia Venturini Helaehil, Suelen Aparecida Ribeiro de Souza, Camila Andrea de Oliveira, Emerielle Cristine Vanzella, Maria Esméria Corezola do Amaral",2021-09-11

After the analysis of post-mortem brain tissues of COVID-19 patients and controls, they observed a correlation between neurological symptoms and increased ACE2 expression. They also correlated viral infection with injury to the blood-brain barrier and inflammation. Finally, they evaluated the levels of soluble PDGFRβ in the cerebrospinal fluid of COVID-19 patients. The data to support their conclusions were: through multiplexed immunostaining, the expression of ACE2 receptor was shown to be restricted to a subset of neurovascular pericytes. The authors hypothesized that viral infection to brain pericytes could lead to the disruption of blood-brain barrier, and indeed leakage of vascular fibrinogen into the central nervous system was observed associated with infected samples. They indicated the possible disruption of brain pericytes homeostasis because they observed significantly low levels of soluble PDGFRβ in the cerebrospinal fluid of infected patients. Overall, this is an interesting study that brings insights into the topic COVID-19 in an elaborate way. In order to improve the manuscript, I´ve made some comments/suggestions bellow as following: 1)	In the introduction page 4, it would be interesting to bring a more detailed approach to brain pericytes: what they are, their location in the neurovascular network, their importance in many neurovascular functions such as angiogenesis, formation and protection of the blood-brain barrier, vascular stability and regulation of blood flow. 2)	In the immunohistochemical methodology, it would be interesting to add how the images were quantified and which parameters were used to classify ACE2 immunoreactivity into low, moderate and high levels. 3)	In the first part of the study of ACE2 expression with post-mortem tissues, it would be interesting to define more clearly its study groups: COVID-19 without neurological symptoms, COVID-19 neurological and controls. Indicating which neurological symptoms were taken into account for such classification and what type of control is being used 4)	Still in the study of ACE2 expression, I felt a lack of images from the other COVID-19 group (e.g., without neurological symptoms) that would represent its non-expression. Would it be possible to include these new data as supplementary figures? 5)	In Figure 1(D): Please include in the legend the abbreviations used, indicating the meaning of Non-ICU and ICU. 6)	In Figure 2(A), SARS-CoV-2 detection step in tissues: identify which controls are being shown, as was done for the COVID-19 images. 7)	In the part of the study where they are measuring the pericytes marker PDGFRβ in cerebrospinal fluid samples, evaluating their homeostatic status and taking into account that a homeostatic imbalance of brain pericytes could lead to a series of disturbances (inflammation, disruption of the blood-brain barrier). I would suggest to include analysis of other inflammatory markers such as IL-6, TNF-β, IFN-ɣ, GM-CSF. Extra inflammatory markers, would give greater robustness to the findings 8)	In general, the authors satisfactorily structure the final discussion, bringing other studies to compose their arguments and results obtained.",2021-12-13T12:45:28,thaislopespinheiro,Thais Lopes Pinheiro,10.1101/2021.05.24.445532,Infection of brain pericytes underlying neuropathology of COVID-19 patients,"Matteo Bocci, Clara Oudenaarden, Xavier Sàenz-Sardà, Joel Simrén, Arvid Edén, Jonas Sjölund, Christina Möller, Magnus Gisslén, Henrik Zetterberg, Elisabet Englund, Kristian Pietras",2021-05-25

Here they look at two different medications, Disulfiram, an anti-alcoholism drug, and copper gluconate which is a common food additive or copper supplement. The study looks at how the mixture of these two drugs effects the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity at the cellular level. They compare this to how well the two drugs effect the activity of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity on their own. They found that a 1:1 ratio of these drugs does a very good job, going from around 67% for each drug on their own to over 90%  against -SARS-CoV-2 when joined together. They also found that the EC50 for the 1:1 combination was even lower than that of the two on their own. This research is very applicable to todays day because of the pandemic we are going through, although we are obviously most interested with what happens in vivo. I thought the research was very interesting though, and if it could be replicated in vivo could be very useful in fighting COVID-19. I thought the paper itself could use some work, but the information was there and it is important to get it out there. Areas for improvement: Major: I thought some of the major things that needed some improvement was the lack of an introduction and conclusion. The paper had great information and did a great job explaining the research, but an introduction is necessary to give background knowledge of research done in the past, why the research is important, etc. A conclusion was also missing and that would have helped the paper flow more and wrap up the research in a concise and understanding manner. Minor: There were a few grammar issues, but nothing too terrible. The author also went off on a tangent that was hard to understand, and didn’t really fit in the last paragraph of the results and discussion (starting at line 37).",2021-12-13T03:40:59,kellenwestra,kellen westra,10.1101/2021.09.17.460613,Copper(II) Gluconate Boosts the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Effect of Disulfiram In Vitro,"Luyan Xu, Wei Xu, Simeng Zhao, Suwen Zhao, Lu Lu, Bo-Lin Lin",2021-10-01
