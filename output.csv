It's not Biosyn Corporation ( http://biosyncorp.com), as you wrote, but rather Bio-Synthesis ( http://biosyn.com). Moreover, in the TSO sequence: ""/5Biosg/"" is the acronym used by IDT for a 5' biotin. The ""g"" has nothing to do with deoxyguanosine (G), but you write in the paper ""5BiosG/"" and this can be confusing. The standard 10x TSO sequence is, in fact: 5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACATrGrGrG-3’ so no G at the 5' (like there was never a G at the 5' of the SMART-seq oligo, from which 10x took their sequence). The code for biotin at Biosyn is [Btn] (standard C6 spacer, which I assume is the one you mean here).",2025-03-04T21:05:38,simonepicelli,Simone Picelli,10.1101/2025.02.22.639662,Multi-platform evaluation and optimization of single-cell RNA isoform sequencing,"James T.

Since it is mentioned (paragrapghs 194 to 196) that very few genomes from the Urnfield Culture exist (as a result of the cremation practice) it would be interesting if the well-preserved samples of the Lichtenstein cave could be integrated in your study.,2025-03-03T16:11:50,hansdb,hansdb,10.1101/2025.02.28.640770,Tracing the Spread of Celtic Languages using Ancient Genomics,"Hugh McColl, Guus Kroonen, Thomaz Pinotti, John Koch, Johan Ling, Jean-Paul Demoule, Kristian Kristiansen, Martin Sikora, Eske Willerslev",2025-03-01

I would perhaps perform the experiments with two additional setups: a) MHC-blockage (If MAIT cells are really specific they should appear here) b) MR1-blockage (if MAIT cells are specific and activated via TCR they should not  appear here) 2) Have you tried to perform the analyses separately for HLA-DRB1*15:01 positive and negative individuals separately? It was shown by a study from Adaptive Biotechnology that a limited number of TCR clusters enriched in MS exist and that these clusters are mostly CD4 and very different in DRB1*15:01 positive and negative individuals.,2025-03-03T14:46:23,elisarosati,Elisa Rosati,10.1101/2024.10.23.619834,Linking myelin and Epstein-Barr virus specific immune responses in multiple sclerosis: insights from integrated public T cell receptor repertoires,"Sebastiaan Valkiers, Amber Dams, Maria Kuznetsova, My Ha, Ibo Janssens, Barbara Willekens, Kris Laukens, Benson Ogunjimi, Nathalie Cools, Pieter Meysman",2024-10-25

Time of day: We did include hour of the scan as a predictor when modeling the minutes of functional data retained during a scan. Though the main effect did not reach significance, you make a good point about a potential interaction with age — I can definitely take a look! Use of mock scanner/pre-scan prep: While it’s an important factor to consider, the majority of the sessions in this dataset did not use any pre-scan accommodation. The exception here is the toddlers that were scanned by the Saxe Lab at MIT. Anecdotally, this was quite helpful at these older ages. Accompanying caregiver: For the data collected at Yale, we do have some notes about the caregivers who were present during the scan. I think your suspicions of a sampling bias are likely correct, but we could certainly still investigate.

In my view it would be helpful if you further develop the descriptions of the state of trabeculation. For example, did you make measurements (counting, thicknesses, proportions) of the trabecular and compact layer, what were the values and how do they relate to diagnostic criteria associated with trabeculation? It would also be helpful if you support this part of your Results with clinical imaging (echocardiography and CMR) onto which is shown the measurements (or overt phenotype) that led to the interpretation of 'hypertrabeculation'. I for one would not mind a full text figure dedicated to this part. Part of the reason for giving these suggestions is of course that your title states 'hypertrabeculation' while the associated phenotyping is proportionally very small and accordingly a bit unclear. Best wishes and good luck with the publication.

Summary This paper explores the capabilities of twin prime editing (twinPE) for large DNA sequence modifications, including deletions, replacements, integrations, and inversions. The authors demonstrate the efficiency of twinPE in human cells (HEK293T & Huh7) and its potential for therapeutic applications when combined with the Bxb1 integrase. Key findings include precise and flexible editing with fewer indels, high knock-in efficiency, and the ability to bypass certain DNA repair pathways. However, the study lacks long-term data on genomic stability and scalability for human applications, and some experimental details and comparisons with other gene-editing techniques are insufficiently explored. Introduction The introduction provides a solid foundation for the study but could benefit from more background information on the therapeutic applications explored, as well as the mechanism that resulted in limitations relating to the pegRNA pairs, or the low Bxb1 efficiency. Results Figure 2: The figure demonstrates twinPE’s efficiency in large DNA sequence insertion and replacement. However, the formatting is poor, the figure legend is separate from the figure and labels are a bit confusing. The authors should revise the figure to improve readability. The large error bar in Fig. 2F (deletion size 589) suggests variability in the editing strategy. The authors should address this in the text, discussing potential outliers or variability in the system. Figure 3: This figure effectively shows the mechanism and efficiency of twinPE combined with Bxb1 integrase. However, the authors should clarify why certain pegRNA pairs performed better than others and why some loci (e.g., CCR5, AAVS1) were more successful. The discussion should also address the limitations of single transfection compared to sequential transfection to allow researchers to build off of this work. Figure 4: The figure explores therapeutic applications of twinPE, particularly in correcting inversions at recombination hotspots. The authors should expand on the implications of these findings for gene therapy and discuss potential challenges in scaling up for human applications. Discussion The discussion is well-written but could be strengthened by addressing the following: Limitations of twinPE: The authors should discuss why lower frequencies occurred in single transfection compared to sequential transfection and why some pegRNA pairs performed better than others. Additionally, they should explore the potential limitations of using Bxb1 integrase and whether other integrases could be more effective. Comparison with other gene-editing techniques: The authors briefly mention the advantages of twinPE over CRISPR but do not provide a direct comparison. Including experimental data or a discussion comparing twinPE to CRISPR or other editing methods would strengthen the paper. Long-term implications: The study lacks long-term data on genomic stability after large DNA modifications. The authors should discuss potential risks, such as off-target effects or genomic instability, and suggest future studies to address these concerns. Suggestions Improve Figure Quality: Revise figures to ensure they are clear, readable, and properly formatted. Include detailed legends and consider adding summary panels to highlight key findings. Expand on Limitations: Discuss the limitations of twinPE in more detail, including variability in editing efficiency, challenges in scaling up for human applications, and potential long-term effects on genomic stability. Compare with Other Techniques: Include a direct comparison of twinPE with CRISPR or other gene-editing methods to highlight its advantages and disadvantages. Explore Additional Integrases: Investigate the use of other integrases in combination with twinPE to determine if they offer improved efficiency or precision. Provide Long-Term Data: Conduct follow-up studies to assess the long-term effects of large DNA modifications on genomic stability and cell viability. Enhance the Introduction: Add more background information on the limitations of existing gene-editing technologies and how twinPE addresses these challenges. Address Variability in Results: Discuss potential outliers or variability in the data, particularly in Fig. 2F, and suggest ways to improve consistency in future experiments. Editorial Decision The paper presents significant advancements in gene-editing technology and demonstrates the potential of twinPE for precise and efficient large DNA sequence modifications. However, the study would benefit from addressing the limitations and expanding on the comparisons with other gene-editing techniques. This publication could be strengthened with revisions to improve figure quality, clarify data interpretation, and exploring long-term stability the genetic edits.

Doing it in the way of this paper won't even guarantee your CNV boundaries are matched correctly with the junction breakends! Let alone consistent junction copy numbers or realistic complex SV events. This approach of treating each ""variant"" as an individual event only works for short variants, and CNVs to some extent. To truly forward simulate a cancer genome that is accumulating structural variants/CNVs requires virtual cell cycles and keeping tabs on the junction balance constraints and linear/circular DNA structures, e.g., losing a telomere, di-centric chromsomes. We tried this before, but it is very very hard as the genomes coming out of the simulations are not anything remotely survivable for a cell and nothing like the real cancer genomes.

Sajadi et al. provide valuable insights into the temporal signaling dynamics of diuretic and anti-diuretic hormones, significantly enhancing our understanding of excretory physiology in mosquitoes. The authors employ heterologous expression of receptors to quantify circulating peptide levels, a robust methodological approach that strengthens receptor-ligand interaction validation and hormone quantification. Notably, the study demonstrates a synergistic interaction between DH31 and kinin-like peptides on Malpighian tubules, contributing novel findings to the existing literature on neuropeptide-mediated excretory regulation in mosquitoes. Overall, the study presents an innovative and well-executed investigation with high methodological rigor. The authors have presented their findings in a clear and well-structured manner. We only have a few questions and comments/suggestions that could help improve the clarity of the manuscript: 1.     Can the authors clarify the exact number of female mosquitoes used in each condition (blood-fed vs. non-blood-fed) at each time point, specifically in methodology section 3.2 for the haemolymph collection? 2.     Were there any biological replicates across different mosquito cohorts? Did the authors observe variability between different mosquito batches? Sample sizes have been provided in the figure captions but what does n signify? 3.     The study utilizes specific time points for haemolymph collection post-blood feeding. Can the authors provide justification for selecting these intervals? Were preliminary studies conducted to determine these as the most informative time-points, or were they based on prior literature? 4.     The authors acknowledge the roles of serotonin (5HT) and DH44 in regulating fluid secretion but focus their experimental analysis on DH31, kinin, and CAPA peptides. Could they clarify why 5HT and DH44 were not included in their haemolymph quantification assays? Were there methodological limitations, or were these hormones not expected to show significant post-bloodmeal changes, or is this something they plan to address in the future? 5.     The study quantifies neuropeptide levels over time but does not discuss the mechanisms responsible for their clearance from haemolymph. Can the authors speculate on whether DH31, kinin, and CAPA peptides are degraded enzymatically, removed through receptor-mediated internalization, or cleared by the Malpighian tubules? Can they use in silico approaches to predict the half-life of these peptides based on their sequence composition? Alternatively, can they extract hemolymph when the peptide has peak activity and test this extract after different times to see how much bioactivity they retain over time? Addressing this would enhance our understanding of neuropeptide turnover and regulation. 6.     Including the individual data points in the bar graphs can provide more information on the spread of the data.

However, we believe the commenter is unfamiliar with recent literature on this topic and may not have fully understood the main aim of our study. The suggestion to “ stop assuming overly simplistic and reductionist conclusions ” does not resonate with our current and past results for the following reasons: 1) We selected the number of components using parallel analysis, a widely accepted data-driven method that compares observed eigenvalues with those generated from random data. This approach outperforms arbitrary variance thresholds used in some fields, as well as other selection methods (Zwick & Velicer, 1986; Velicer et al., 2000; Hayton et al., 2004). Several alternative methods exist, but parallel analysis has been shown to provide a statistically robust basis for component selection across disciplines. 2) As described in our manuscript, we extracted and analyzed two components for all muscles. Together, these components accounted for 85% of the variance in TA, 85% in FDI, 69% in VL, and 65% in VM-VL, values that align with prior studies (see, for example, Negro et al. 2009, Del Vecchio et al. 2023, Rossato et al. 2024). All these previous studies have used a number of components that together accounted for less than 90% of the variance. 3) Our results show that the first of the two extracted components (which accounts for a considerable portion of variance of smoothed discharge rates) is more strongly correlated with force oscillations than the second component, a finding that was robust across different muscles and both linear methods employed. Additionally, we demonstrated that the second component was not consistent across trials with the same force output, questioning its role in the control of force generation. Finally, our non-linear network-information framework corroborated the presence of a single dominant component, reinforcing our findings through an independent approach. Therefore, we strongly encourage the anonymous commenter a more focused read of our manuscript and we welcome any further constructive discussions and feedback that help improve our work.",2025-02-18T17:48:27,helio_cabral,Helio Cabral,10.1101/2025.02.04.635938,A single low-dimensional neural component of motor unit activity explains force generation across repetitive isometric tasks,"Hélio V.

The paper states: Overall, the CosMx 6K segmentation tool produced cells with larger sizes, higher solidity, and better circularity, indicative of more regular and convex cell shapes compared to other platforms I would argue ""larger"", ""more circular"", and ""convex"" do not necessarily mean better segmentation. For example, ""more circular"" and ""convex"" could be  the bias of the particular segmentation model. If more circular is better, then ""nucleus segmentation + large expansion"" (basically the first version of Xenium segmentation prior to multi modal cell segmentation stain) is the better segmentation since it's large, circular, and convex. The paper later states: Among the ST platforms, Xenium 5K showed better separation of marker gene pairs after segmentation We further visualized marker gene expression across the annotated cell types. Xenium 5K exhibited the most distinct expression patterns (Supplementary Fig. 8d), facilitating more accurate cell type annotations. and concludes: Despite exhibiting more irregular segmentation shapes, Xenium 5K effectively distinguished different cell types and minimized transcript mixing between adjacent cells ""Better separation of marker gene pairs"", ""distinguish different cell types"" and ""minimize transcript mixing"" are indeed the more principled and biologically meaningful metrics to evaluate cell segmentation.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.09.632152v1#comment-6654236679,biorxivstage,1,"Dear authors, as a part of a group activity in our lab we discussed your very interesting manuscript with the goal of reviewing it as well as improving our reviewing skills. The below review is the result of this exercise and reflects thoughts and comments of several people. We hope this helps you with your way forward to publish the paper in a good journal. Summary The manuscript by Cresto et al. addresses an important question concerning the contribution of astrocytic defects in oligophrenin‐1 (Ophn1) deficiency in intellectual disability. Ophn1 is highly present at synapses and regulates the RhoA/ROCK/MLC2 pathway through its RhoGAP domain, having an important role in cytoskeleton remodelling. Previous work from the authors of this manuscript reported that constitutive Ophn1 knockout mice show deficits in synaptic transmission and plasticity, due to pre-synaptic dysfunction. Moreover, Ophn1 deficient astrocytes from those mice also display altered morphology resulting from hyperactivation of the RhoA/ROCK/MLC2 pathway. This study examines the impact of astroglial Ophn1 deficiency on synaptic transmission, plasticity, and spatial memory using a conditional, localized, and AAV-inducible approach. The researchers selectively disrupt Ophn1 in adult hippocampal astrocytes and assess astrocyte morphology, synaptic coverage, and explore two key molecular mechanisms: adenosine A1 receptor signaling and the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. A strength of this study is the comparison between the conditional knockdown and the constitutive KO model, which helps to confirm that some of the observed effects are specifically due to the presence of the protein in astrocytes. However, a potential weakness is that in some cases, the targeting may not have been sufficient to fully isolate the astroglial pathway, leaving room for contributions from other cell types or compensatory mechanisms. Another strength of this study is the comprehensive approach taken to investigate the effects of oligophrenin deficiency in astrocytes, encompassing behavioral experiments, electrophysiology, cellular morphology, and molecular pathways. However, the molecular pathway analysis remains incomplete, leaving some mechanistic aspects unresolved. One limitation of this study is the exclusive use of adult mice and mature astrocytes to investigate a neurodevelopmental disorder, which may not fully capture the relevant developmental mechanisms. Additionally, all experiments were conducted in murine astrocytes, with no validation in human cell lines, raising questions about the translatability of the findings. Major Comments 1.	KDastro and KDneuro verification would benefit from additional protein-level quantifications in a Western Blot or immunostaining, e.g. by using directly an anti-oligophrenin antibody or an anti-FLAG-tag antibody. 2.	The measurements of alternations in the Y maze test could be described in more detail. This specific test relies on the difference between entries into consecutive different arms (i.e. ABC) and into the same arm (i.e. ABB). In the methods section, it is not completely clear if the authors discriminate between these two parameters and how they defined the ""ABB"" alternation. Authors could also introduce the different percentages (consecutive vs. same) into the graph to give a clearer picture of the phenotype. 3.	In addition, the statement that spatial working memory is abolished results a little extreme from only these experiments. It could be defined as impaired or reduced. 4.	Authors claim a reduction in presynaptic release probability, yet the first peak in Fig. 1d is similar for both WT and KDastro. The authors should clarify in the text what they mean by this statement, and how they interpret it from the data. If they mean to imply that there are more presynaptic vesicles, which are released at a lower probability, it would be good to quantify presynaptic vesicle numbers, for instance using EM. 5.	Authors conclude that KDastro neurons show an increase in the activation of adenosine A1 receptors yet they don't validate this phenotype. In Fig.2, it is not clear if the effect of 8-CPT is rescuing the phenotype in KDastro neurons or simply acting on receptor activation as for WT neurons. In the full Ophn1 KO model, neurons are lacking Ophn1, unlike KDastro neurons which still express the protein. Can the authors investigate deeper on the activation of the A1 receptors in KDastro? They could assess cAMP levels via cAMP sensors (i.e. FRET-based cAMP sensors) and PKA activation by immunoblotting for its phosphorylated substrates. In addition, they could also measure adenosine release from Ophn1-KD astrocytes. This could help to define the molecular mechanism supporting the electrophysiological observations. 6.	ROCK inhibitor treatment in the slices is only 20 min. Is this timeframe sufficient to induce morphological changes in the astrocytes? It would be more convincing if a corresponding actin staining was provided. 7.	When ROCK is inhibited, it affects both neurons and astrocytes. Can authors discriminate that the observed neuronal effects are specifically due to ROCK inhibition in astrocytes, rather than direct effects on neurons? This is particularly relevant since ROCK inhibition is expected to mimic the presence of Ophn1, potentially rescuing the astrocytic Ophn1 deficiency. 8.	For both inhibitors (8CPT and Y27632) they don’t validate that in fact inhibition works effectively and that they only target their protein of interest. They could validate this by immunoblotting downstream targets of the adenosine A1 receptor and ROCK, but also potential other off-targets that could be inhibited, like PKC in the case of Y27632. 9.	“Increased branching complexity” only occurs at one specific distance of 25 microns  (Fig 3.d). Generalization of this one measurement seems an overstatement. 10.	Assessment of true morphology of tripartite synapses in Ophn1 KDastro can be further investigated with electron microscopy. This can help to better evaluate changes in plasma membrane and cell boundary morphology on synapses. 11.	Paper would greatly benefit from an illustration of a suggested molecular mechanism. Minor Comments 1.	What is “CD8” for on figure 1b.? 2.	It is not clear what “py” stands for in Fig. 1 d and f. 3.	In figure 1e and 1g it is unclear how the quantification was done. 4.	Figure 3, 4 and 5a-d lack information on the # of mice that were assessed, only the # of astrocytes is reported. 5.	Red and dark red colouring in Fig. 5 are very hard to discern. Authors should consider other colour schemes. 6.	Manuscript would benefit from describing 8CPT and Y27632 functions in the results section. 7.	WT control is missing in Fig. 5e.",2025-02-18T16:22:01,,Anonymous,10.1101/2025.01.09.632152,Astroglial deficiency for oligophrenin-1 contributes to intellectual disability,"Noémie Cresto, Pascal Ezan, Laure-Elise Pillet, David Mazaud, Philippe Mailly, Alexis Bemelmans, Hamid Meziane, Mohammed Selloum, Tania Sorg, Nicola Marchi, Yann Hérault, Pierre Billuart, Nathalie Rouach",2025-01-11

Perhaps the most severe example is the housecat-- still portrayed as cute in media, but in the feral form a worldwide destroyer of birds. One critique concerning the Ivory-billed Woodpecker-- the number quoted by Troy et al, 20 million dollars spent for studies, is misleading. Most of the efforts are university and private, not governmental, and if the bird is proven to be extant, will have conservation benefits since it is a wide-ranging and keystone species. I help with research for the Ivory-billed Woodpecker. The growing body of evidence that this species exists is more rational than the critique-- see other BioRxiv papers and the work of Mike Collins for example.

A significant strength lies in its interdisciplinary approach, integrating mathematical modeling, bioinformatics, and clinical insights to establish a framework for understanding the therapeutic effects of ozone therapy. The use of Lyapunov exponents, Shannon entropy, and fractal dimensions to quantify biological complexity is particularly innovative, providing a structured means of evaluating systemic responses to treatment. Additionally, the study’s emphasis on precision dosing—highlighting the differential effects of low versus high ozone concentrations—adds valuable insight into the hormetic nature of the therapy, reinforcing the need for controlled perturbations in medical interventions. The thorough review of existing literature, including randomized controlled trials, strengthens the credibility of the findings and underscores the translational potential of the proposed model. However, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The reliance on mathematical simulations, while insightful, may not fully capture the variability of real-world biological responses, as complex physiological interactions are difficult to model with absolute accuracy. Additionally, while the study references clinical data, it does not provide direct experimental validation, making it difficult to assess the immediate applicability of the findings in clinical practice. The concept of adaptive chaos, though compelling, remains somewhat abstract, and further empirical studies are needed to establish its clinical relevance definitively. Lastly, some of the statistical approaches, particularly the unusually high values of Lyapunov exponents, may require re-evaluation to ensure their biological plausibility and proper contextualization within established dynamical system theory. Despite these challenges, the study provides a groundbreaking theoretical framework with promising implications for regenerative medicine and personalized therapy.",2025-02-12T06:12:29,profsergiomannivanzini,Prof. Sergio Manni Vanzini,10.1101/2025.02.05.636618,Harnessing Adaptive Chaos: Exploring the role of oxygen-ozone therapy in modulating complexity and repair in spine disorders via a bio-informatic model,"Salvatore Chirumbolo, Marianno Franzini, Umberto Tirelli, Giovanni Ricevuti, Fortunato Loprete, Tommaso Richelmi, Francesco Vaiano, Antonio Carlo Galoforo, Marianna Chierchia, Luigi Valdenassi",2025-02-08

Many neurons in synergistic muscles are correlated with a unique subset of neurons. I strongly suggest you check with pearson correlation of the smoothed motor unit discharge rates. Also, force variability is only partly predicted by a single common input. Please stop assuming overly simplistic and reductionist conclusions.You also show that only 70% of the variance (which, in fact, should be 50 to 60% of the first component) is explained. In all other disciplines, it is usually concluded that it is only one component when it explains more than 90% of the variance! BOOK KNOWLEDGE: In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), when it's concluded that there is only one component, the first principal component should ideally explain a significant portion of the variance—typically more than 90%. However, the exact threshold can depend on the specific context or data, but generally, when a single component explains more than 90% of the variance, it's reasonable to conclude that this component captures the majority of the relevant information in the data. If the first component explains less than 90%, it might suggest that multiple components are needed to adequately represent the variance in the data, and assuming only one component could oversimplify the analysis. In your case, when discussing 70% variance, it might imply that the first component doesn't fully capture the structure of the data, and it could suggest that more components are necessary to explain a larger proportion of the variance.",2025-02-10T15:33:35,,Anonymous,10.1101/2025.02.04.635938,A single low-dimensional neural component of motor unit activity explains force generation across repetitive isometric tasks,"Hélio V.

The study by Chirumbolo et al. presents a compelling and innovative perspective on adaptive chaos and its role in modulating oxygen-ozone therapy for spine disorders. By integrating mathematical modeling, bioinformatics, and clinical insights, the authors provide a rigorous framework to understand how mild chaotic perturbations can enhance systemic complexity and biological resilience. A particular strength of this work lies in its multidimensional approach, incorporating Shannon entropy, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions to quantify the therapeutic impact of oxygen-ozone therapy. Therefire, in my opinion, the authors successfully demonstrate that low-dose ozone (20–40 µg/ml O3) fosters adaptive chaos, leading to reduced inflammation, enhanced repair, and improved systemic stability. In contrast, higher doses (>60 µg/ml O3) appear to push the system into pathological chaos, emphasizing the importance of precision dosing in regenerative medicine. Really interesting outcomes! The translational significance of this study cannot be overstated. It not only advances our understanding of chaos-driven medical interventions but also sets a precedent for personalized medicine strategies that leverage nonlinear dynamics to optimize therapeutic outcomes. Future research could expand on these findings by incorporating real-world clinical datasets and patient-specific modeling, further solidifying the role of adaptive chaos in medical practice. I trust this study is a landmark contribution to the fields of biophysics, complexity science, and regenerative medicine, offering novel insights into the interplay between biological chaos and therapeutic control.
