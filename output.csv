These results are thorough, compelling and persuasive. They also stand in contrast with other papers, published in the aftermath of alphafold's release, that argue the opposite. The main concern for me is the absence of any testing or discussion surrounding the relax step of the pipeline - the manuscript never uses the words ""relax"", ""minimization"", and ""openmm"" (the package used by alphafold for all-atom minimization), and I did not find details in the accompanying github repo. It is therefore unclear how much of the results should be attributed to the neural network itself and how much should be attributed to the minimization step following structure prediction. We can't rule out the possibility that the strain being measured results from this second step. Were that the case, it would cast doubt on the role of the alignment and templates as the authors suggest in the discussion.",2023-09-21T08:42:03,diegodelalamo,Diego del Alamo,10.1101/2022.04.14.488301,AlphaFold2 can predict single-mutation effects,"John M.

Our original finding that the peptide PEN is an agonist of GPR83 was already verified by two different laboratories (see Foster et al, 2019, “Discovery of Human Signaling Systems: Pairing Peptides to G Protein-Coupled Receptors”, Cell, PMID: 31675498; and Parobchak et al, 2020, “Uterine Gpr83 mRNA is highly expressed during early pregnancy and GPR83 mediates the actions of PEN in endometrial and non-endometrial cells”, FS Science, PMID: 35559741). However, when another laboratory can’t confirm what was published, it is important to consider differences between the studies. With this in mind, there are several issues with the study presented here in the BioRxiv report by Giesecke et al. Additional experiments described below would be very helpful. The HEK293 cell line has been reported to express GPR83 mRNA in many studies listed in GEO Profile, and this is confirmed in the current study (Figure 1A). In the figure showing overexpression of HA-tagged GPR83 in HEK293 cells, the distribution is largely intracellular, maybe ER or Golgi (Figure 1B). Thus, it’s not relevant to consider ‘100-fold’ overexpression based on mRNA, as the amount that is correctly folded and expressed at the cell surface may not be much different than in the native HEK293 cell line. Furthermore, the authors show that PEN peptide does produce a robust increase in phosphoERK in Figure 4A (compare the lanes labeled ‘control’ and ‘PEN’). Furthermore, it looks like the PEN-mediated increase in phosphoERK is several fold higher in GPR83-transfected cells than in control cells (Figure 4A). Although the quantitation panel in Figure 4B doesn’t show an increase, there are very large ‘error bars’ reported to be SD, but for N=2 doesn’t SD really mean the range of duplicates? Also, please show all data points in the bar graph! In any case, it would be nice to see a larger N for these studies. But best of all would be a knock-down of GPR83 in HEK293 cells using siRNA, or a related approach. Another point is that in the PEN-GPR83 peptide-receptor system, signaling assays that are distal to the receptor activity (cAMP, PLC) tend to give variable results – this has been previously noted in our original study (Gomes et al, PMID: 27117253). This also appears to be the case with the TANGO assay where we have recently found that long-term treatment with PEN (16 hrs) causes a desensitization of the receptor leading to a complete loss of signal (our unpublished observations). There are also issues with the concentration dependence, and ‘u-shaped’ curves where high concentrations of PEN fail to produce the effects seen with lower concentrations (PMID: 27117253). The authors should repeat the studies with shorter times and lower concentrations of PEN. The lack of binding with Tyr-PEN seen by Giesecke et al. could be due to the presence of an internal His residue in human PEN (YAADHDVGSELPPEGVLGALLRV). Tyr-PEN  used in our previous studies for iodination was the rat sequence, which does not have a His. Because His residues can be iodinated using the chloramine T procedure used by Giesecke et al, this can potentially affect binding. It would be good to test binding with iodinated rat Tyr-PEN, to avoid the His residue. Also, why the C-term amide group? That’s not part of PEN. For the Ca++ assays, Giesecke et al. used Gα16, but our previous studies used Gα16/i3 (PMID: 27117253). This is not a minor difference. Ideally, Giesecke et al could repeat the experiments with Gα16/i3. Finally, protease inhibitors were used in the binding studies by Giesecke et al, which is good. It is not clear if such inhibitors were used in all other studies with PEN, such as those described in Figure 2 and 3. In the absence of protease inhibitors, PEN could be degraded during the assays and this could have accounted for the negative results.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.13.557637v1#comment-6281395492,biorxivstage,1,"A few comments: Figure 1 essentially estimates  the tMRCA of lineage A and B from 3xB and 1xA sequences. The resulting confidence interval is of course, massive. It is not surprising that it overlaps with other estimates that essentially also estimate the tMRCA of A and B. I fail to see how this adds anything new or supports any conclusion. Figure 2's use of p-values does not properly account for the extreme sampling bias: sampling intensity around the wildlife stalls was much higher than elsewhere. More sampling leads to better p-values. Tom Wenseleers' analysis here is more proper: https://twitter.com/TWensel... Figure 2 B is particularly vulnerable to this bias, as the sequencing attempts were extremely clustered. Figure 2C seems to have omitted some data points: compare with this from Tom Wenseleers again: https://twitter.com/TWensel... Overall, the data actually points to an area near the market entrance/the toilets/the mah jong rooms, and the ""hot areas"" are not over the wildlife stalls. The sampling bias is also particularly visible in figure 3B, which would seem to show an association of human reads with wildlife stalls, when of course, the presence of humans was fairly uniform throughout the market (likely higher concentrations around the entrance/toilets/bathrooms) Figure 4 is notable because it shows CoVs definitively associated with wildlife had a significantly different distribution than SARS-CoV-2. Either SARS-CoV-2 did not emerge from those wilflife stalls, or too much time had passed to make any conclusions. It also serves as evidence against their argument that SARS-CoV-2 RNA from infected animals would have decayed substantially (as the other CoV RNA apparently had not). Figure 5 is interesting, but it does not establish where any of the animals came from. It simply rules out Vietnam and a Chinese provine north of Hubei. The authors then proceed to engage in pure speculation about the possibility of the Raccoon dogs coming from an area known to have SARS-CoV-2 like viruses.

The authors present compelling evidence that fine-tuning sequence-based machine learning models (protein language models) on in-house experimental data can accelerate the discovery of high-affinity binders, in this case against CD40. However, the entire manuscript is focused on single-chain nanobodies, not antibodies as the text suggests, and the authors only mention this in second and third paragraphs of Results as well as the caption of Figure 2. This is an extremely important distinction and I think the authors need to revise their language throughout the document to make this clear; i.e., use the term nanobody, not antibody. Nanobodies differ from antibodies in several key respects, such as loop lengths, which are discussed here: doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023..... Relevant to this manuscript is the fact that they comprise a single chain, and are thus amenable to out-of-the-box masked and/or autoregressive protein language models. Standard antibodies consist of two chains; to my knowledge, only one method, which has not been peer reviewed, has been trained on paired antibody sequences: arxiv.org/abs/2308.14300. Thus, several obstacles still exist that prevent the methods described here from being directly translated to standard monoclonal antibodies.

The authors write, Prior studies calculated correlations of SARS-CoV-2 detection and animal sequence read abundances in market samples, concluding that SARS-CoV-2 was negatively correlated with mammalian wildlife species (Liu et al. 2023; Bloom 2021). The intended citation is presumably to ( Bloom 2023), not to ( Bloom 2021). 2. The authors claim that ""The start of the COVID-19 pandemic was traced epidemiologically to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market"" (p. 3). This is false or misleading. After the first-detected market-linked cluster was noticed, this led the search for more cases to focus heavily on the market: i.e., that is simply where the local Chinese authorities looked, as they have made clear in repeated statements ( Bahry 2023, Table 1). For instance, the WHO-China joint study emphasizes the ""epidemiology surveillance at several hospitals (close to Huanan market), Huanan market and the neighbourhood of Huanan market"" ( WHO-China 2021, Annex p. 125). Strangely, the authors do not cite these repeated warnings about sampling bias in the early search, by those who did the search. Nor do they cite my critique ( Bahry 2023) of their earlier attempt to control for such bias ( Worobey et al. 2022). 3. Strangely, the authors' heat map in their ""relative risk"" analysis of positivity rate (Fig. 2a) shows very little heat for the highest-positivity-rate stall: a beef stall in the east wing with 1/1 samples positive (cf. Bahry 2023, Fig. 1). Although the authors do not explain this anomaly, it seems to be due to an analytical strategy which downplays less-sampled stalls. Their heat map does not depict stalls' positivity rates: rather it depicts the p-values of stalls' positivity rates. However, smaller samples will automatically have lower p-values for the same positivity rate, due to smaller samples having lower power to detect the same effect size. Thus, rather than showing the spatial distribution of elevated positivity, their heat map more reflects the spatial distribution of sampling effort (heavily concentrated in the southwest wildlife corner). An alternative approach would have been to map relative risk itself, estimated with smoothing by pseudocounts (cf. Bahry 2023, Fig. 1). Estimating positivity as s +0.077/ n +1, for s positives out of n samples, takes into account both the 7.7% positivity base rate, and noise due to uncertainty in less-sampled stalls.",2023-09-17T03:50:07,davidbahry,David Bahry,10.1101/2023.09.13.557637,Genetic tracing of market wildlife and viruses at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Alexander Crits-Christoph, Joshua I.

We collectively agreed it's a stimulating contribution to understanding how individual specialization emerges and is maintained in natural populations. Most of the literature on the causes of individual specialization focuses on the ecological (i.e., extrinsic) causes of this phenomenon (sensu Araújo et al. 2011 Ecology Letters), while the proximate causes (e.g., functional trade-offs, social status) have surprisingly been little studied. Part of this discrepancy is due to the challenges of testing whether and how individuals' intrinsic traits influence their trophic preferences. This preprint adds a novel level of complexity to the field by quantifying (i) the relative contribution of largely overlooked proximate causes (social learning, maternal effects, genetic factors) and (ii) the simultaneous effects of ecological (i.e., environment context) and proximate causes. We were positively impressed by the quality of the data and statistical analyses during our discussion. The resolution and temporal extent of the data used are unprecedented in the literature, and the Bayesian framework implemented is thorough. As we appreciated the quantitative approaches, our discussion focused mainly on how the question is motivated in the introduction and the major implications of the results. We agreed that the introduction outlines well how the measured factors are expected to drive individual heterogeneity. Still, a more general framing of the research questions could make the manuscript more appealing to a broader and more diverse readership. For instance, the introduction begins by explaining that environmental factors are key drivers of trophic niche variation. However, unraveling how individuality emerges in natural systems, by nature and/or nurture, is a general question that is still widely open in different areas of science - and we believe this manuscript provides exciting results in this regard. In the discussion, the fact that maternal learning, maternal effect, and environment combined explain most of the variance in trophic position (lines 297-299) could be further explored to emphasize the importance of simultaneously studying proximate and ecological causes of individual specialization. Also, the sizable residual observed in the ""Maternal learning"" model suggests that understanding what generates trophic diversity within populations is far more complex than initially thought, particularly in species with complex social structures, creating a stimulating challenge for future studies.

HTT depletion clearly induces a re-location (not a mis-location-since drebrin can locate to filopodia) from the T-zone to filopodia.  Unsurprisingly, given that the drebrin/EB3/Cdk5 pathway enables the capture of dynamic microtubules by filopodia, this is associated with a striking increase in microtubules in filopodia-actually the most significant change you measured in HTT-depleted growth cones.  Drebrin in the T-zone is largely unphosphorylated at S142 and therefore in the folded conformation, which can bind anti-parallel F-actin through one of its two F-actin binding sites.  In contrast, drebrin in filopodia is phosphorylated at S142 and therefore in the open conformation, enabling it to bind to parallel F-actin bundles using both F-actin binding sites.  Drebrin can cross-link F-actin to dynamic microtubules by binding to EB3 in filopodia.  Another manipulation that re-locates drebrin (our unpublished observations) and myosin IIB from the T-zone to filopodia is the inhibition of myosin II by blebbistatin, which essentially disassembles the F-actin in the T-zone removing an impediment to microtubule advance into the P-domain (Hur et al., 2011, P.N.A.S. 108, 5057-5062; Shin et al., 2014, PLoS ONE 9(4): e95212. doi:10.1371; Dupraz et al., 2019, Current Biology 29, 3874–3886).

The principle is to embed both the states (graph nodes) and the actions (graph edges) in the same high-dimensional space, such that the graph distances are represented by geometric distances between nodes, and the actions correspond to directions in the space. Then the agent can pursue the shortest route by choosing the action that points in the direction of the target node. The embeddings of both states and actions are learned during random exploration of the graph, based on optimizing a prediction of the next state from the previous state and action. Ultimately the embedding should be such that the next state can be predicted by simply adding the action vector to the previous state. The authors argue that all this can be accomplished with biologically plausible learning rules. Evaluation This is an interesting suggestion for how an agent might learn the structure of its environment, namely how states and actions are connected. This ultimately results in a goal signal, by which the correct action can be chosen that leads to the goal in the shortest amount of time. Some of my questions concern whether the algorithms are really neuromorphic, in the sense that they could be implemented in biological neural circuits. Concerns about bio-plausibility: 1. The learning rule for state-action association, Eqns 2 and 3: This looks difficult to implement with neurons, because: a) it involves two different time points on the post-synaptic side: s_{t+1} appears at time t+1, but \hat s_{t+1} at time t; b) to make s_{t+1} appear in that neural population, the action vector must temporarily be switched off, requiring some kind of control system; c) the postsynaptic variable is a difference between two successive time points. It is not obvious how to implement such a delta rule with biophysics. 2. The computation of utility, Eqn 4: Again, how would this be implemented with neurons? a) It involves multiplying a population vector with another vector in the same population; what would be the mechanism for such a multiply-and-add operation? b) In the left term, the activity is driven by an action; in the right term, activity of the same neurons is driven by observations. How would that be accomplished? c) The right term involves subtracting activity from the current observations from activity driven by some remembered observation. How are the remembered observations stored? Are these fed into the network one after another? How are they subtracted? 3. Normalization of synaptic weights a) Eqn 5: Here each input synapse gets modified by a factor that depends on the strengths of all the other synapses onto that same neuron. This violates the locality of synaptic plasticity: A synapse should be modified based only on its own strength and the activity of the pre-and postsynaptic neurons. b) Another related normalization appears in line 660. 4. Winner-take-all choice (Eqn 7): Explain how this would work in a neuromorphic system? How does the agent sample the values of the affordable actions? By actually executing them in the real world one at a time and comparing the resulting output from Eqn 4? But then the observations o_t would change as all the actions are played out. Or is the comparison done “mentally” without real-world action? If so, does this require some accessory system that can look up the codes of all the affordable actions and feed them into the network one at a time? In summary, if the authors advocate that this model could be implemented in brains, it would be helpful if the proposal included a bio-plausible neural circuit for each of these operations. Other questions: 5. Graphs with cycles a) As pointed out (p.9), the theory behind this learning model causes problems with cyclic graphs. All the graph edges are supposed to be orthogonal in the embedding space, yet adding the edges around a loop should give zero. Both can’t be true. It is not clear how this conflict was resolved. Does it require careful parameter tuning so as to sustain performance of the model? b) Line 585 describes a hack by which the agent was prevented from traveling cycles during exploration. That requires oracular knowledge of the graph. How would that work in a real-world system? 6. The concept of “action” a) In the first part of the paper (p.1-12), every edge on the graph is considered a different action, and they are all encoded with one-hot vectors. For example, a robot action like “turn left” would have a different one-hot code at every different location. This is somewhat different from the common concept of “action”, which is specific to the agent’s movements, not where they are executed. By postulating a one-hot code for every edge on the graph one effectively circumvents the problem of path integration, which requires making a prediction from stringing together actions that may appear identical from the agent’s perspective. b) Please explain how a naive agent entering a new environment will already have a one-hot code for every edge on the graph, even if they involve identical movements of the agent. c) What if the actions instead were agent-centered, e.g. {left, right, forward, back} as in the second part of the paper (p.13ff). Would the system still be able to learn an arbitrary graph? 7. “Affordances” a) What is the source of the “affordances” in Eqn 6. They represent part of the graph structure. Don’t these need to be learned as well? In the present formulation it seems they are offered to the system without learning (contra line 194). b) By what mechanism would this happen in a neuromorphic system, and how would they be represented by the neural circuit? c) Figure 4e highlights the fact that the agent takes an action that was never taken during exploration (Fig 4c). But what if there was a wall between those two nodes, and that’s why the action never occurred there? How does the agent know that the action is “affordable”. 8. Parameter sensitivity a) It appears that for each of the illustrated graphs the embedding space had a different dimensionality, and different choices were made for the learning rates (p.22). In line 610, the state space has fewer dimensions than the number of actions, which obviously precludes finding orthogonal vectors. What motivated all these different choices? b) How robust is the system to the relevant parameters? Can the same agent with one parameter set learn different spaces? The report would benefit from exploring a wider range of graphs and scanning over parameter values. 9. Related work There is prior research on these topics that could be used to put the current work in context. In particular, various versions of model-based reinforcement learning acquire the structure of the state space through learning, so that a goal-directed policy can be superposed on that. The present paper only deals with learning the state space, not with learning the goal locations: Those are provided by some unspecified accessory system. Within the RL literature there has been recent enthusiasm about the ""successor representation”, which is an embedding that helps predict the agent’s next state. For neuromorphic models that learn the successor representation, see for example Fang 2023 ( https://doi.org/10.7554/eLi... and literature cited there. Other suggestions: 10. There is frequent reference to “planning”. But the model presented here doesn’t make any plans. Once it arrives at a node it decides on the next action, as though it had a lookup table (see line 13). It does not “think ahead”. In the neuroscience and robotics field, “planning” usually concerns evaluating the outcome of successive actions ahead of time, for example comparing the value of different routes. The behavior implemented here is more like “online navigation”. This may be confusing to the reader. 11. In Figures 4 and 5, is there a meaning to the emojis painted on the nodes? At least this reader finds them distracting. Preceding figures worked just fine without emojis. 12. In part 2 (p.13ff) the main difference from part 1 is that the actions are now agent-centric. It may help the reader to point this out. Because there are only 4 action vectors, the predictions are forced into a 4-dimensional subspace of the high-dimensional space. Eventually, the learning process squeezes that into a 2-dimensional subspace that accurately reproduces the geometry of the graph. 13. Eqn 4: should start with u_t= 14. Figure 6c: Perhaps show a bit more of the time course to document that the two variables have settled. 15. Fig 2 caption: “square root of the length of the shortest path” should this be “square root of the sum of squares along the shortest path”. As stated, it doesn’t resemble the law of Pythagoras. 16.

I want to commend the collective efforts of the authors involved in this study. The study's focus on plant parasitic interactions, given their intricate nature, is truly captivating. Investigating the processes and transmission of ROS signaling is vital for understanding a plant's stress response.

(Please note here the specific references you are referring to, for example, reference A could potentially be replaced with B, etc.). (2) The absence of a methodology section is notable. While the innovative approach is intriguing, more detailed information about experimental conditions and materials is required for a comprehensive understanding of the results.

My research project focuses on the study of ncRNA in the interaction between parasitic plants and host plants. Our laboratory has initiated an activity called the ""Preprint Club"" where we train and learn to review preprints relevant to our research areas. I have selected your preprint titled ""Long noncoding RNAs emerge from transposon-derived antisense sequences and may contribute to infection stage-specific transposon regulation in a fungal phytopathogen"" for reading and critical review. In this manuscript, Qian and colleagues conduct an extensive study on the identification, classification, and investigation of transposable elements (TEs) and ncRNAs in the genome of Blumeria hordei, a powdery mildew fungal pathogen of Hordeum vulgare (Barley). This is a highly interesting manuscript; the methods are well-documented in the literature, and the results are significant. In my opinion, the authors could provide more information in the Introduction about the infection cycle of B. hordei, as understanding this pathogenic process is crucial for interpreting the presented results. Additionally, here are some specific comments regarding questions and corrections that seemed pertinent to me during my reading. Specific comments: Lines 135-136: The presentation of PC and NMDS analyses is confusing in terms of result interpretation because they do not complement each other, as mentioned in the text. How do the NMDS results influence the interpretation of the PCA results? Lines 172-173: For the 102 TEs, where is the expression data? Lines 181-183: How did you identify if they are peptide-coding transcripts, and what criteria were used to evaluate their significance? Figures 3B and C are not mentioned in the text. Figure 3D should be reversed in terms of read mappings to follow the order of citation in the text (RNA-Seq and ONT), or the text could be modified to maintain the order of appearance in the figure. Lines 203-204: There seems to be a missing punctuation mark in the text. Line 208: Although Figure 4 is mentioned to display information about the lncRNAs identified in the study (such as exon numbers and size), it might be better to specify in which section of Figure 4 this information can be found, e.g., Figure 4B-C. Lines 233-234: How were the analyses for the identification of putative secreted proteins conducted? Was there a pipeline used for identifying such proteins?

A main target of antibiotics is the bacterial ribosome. To address the problem of antibiotic resistance in the clinic, Mesa et. al. isolated different Pseudomonas aeruginosa’s strains from cystic fibrosis patients over 8 years that displayed resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. They conducted genomic sequencing and discovered these isolates contain a 12 nucleotide deletion in the rpflF gene that encodes the universal large subunit ribosomal protein 6 (uL6). This mutation has previously been reported in the paper by Halfon et al. (2019) which includes the structural comparison between the mutant and wild type ribosome. In this manuscript the authors determined “~86 ribosomal structures” structures of mutant and wild-type ribosomes with different antibiotics using single particle cryoEM to understand how resistance develops in these mutants. Their main results indicated the uL6 mutation rewires the ribosome conformational landscape and displays resistance to aminoglycosides. Their study confirmed canonical binding sites for aminoglycosides, but new binding sites were discovered for tobramycin in the uL6 mutants. Most importantly, the uL6 mutants displayed a tradeoff between aminoglycoside resistance and chloramphenicol sensitivity, dubbed as collateral sensitivity. In summary, this article provided an in depth structural analysis of antibiotics complexed with the ribosome from clinically relevant antibiotic resistant bacteria, however, there are a few major and minor concerns that we would like the authors to address. Major points. Would it be possible to structurally rationalize why uL6 is more ordered in closed conformation of ribosome and not in the open conformation in case of the mutant? and the same for with and without antibiotics? Would it be possible to make a 1:1 comparison between the uL6 densities in mutant and wildtype datasets for different classes? In the current version of the manuscript we couldn’t see a figure showing the uL6 density in wild-type datasets except in Ro1 class. Could the authors observe any density for uL6 in reconstructions from RC, RT and RK datasets and how does it differ (or not) from the respective mutant classes? (Note: it is difficult to interpret whether uL6 is well ordered or not from supplementary figure S4) How is H69 affected by the uL6 mutation? What are the structural features that connect these two which can prove that the retracted and stretched conformations of H69 are a cause of uL6 apart from the fact that they only exist in the L6M dataset? Could you explain this for example, by looking at the interactions that connect H69 and uL6 mutation region in WT structure? In Fig3B-I, where uL6 is shown to act like a wrist band, it is unclear how the allostery actually manifests structurally. We don’t really have a specific interaction map for R vs L ribosomes such that we can get to know how the interactions are altered in L which then leads to AGA inhibition/CHL sensitivity. Having something like a chord plot showing key interactions that regulate allostery and then highlighting specific interactions that are affected in L ribosome datasets will help. The authors termed a specific part of the 23S rRNA as “50S vulnerable region” because they could see that there was an increase in the flexibility of this region. It is unclear how this flexibility was quantified and what the reference was in quantifying it (i.e. it is flexible in comparison to what?). It is also a bit confusing where exactly this region is located since figure 2F is quite cluttered. There can be two figures, one showing the r proteins and the other just showing the vulnerable region. It would be useful if the authors could highlight the PTC in figure 2F since the proximity of “50S vulnerable region” to PTC is not very obvious. For example H95 which is part of SRL, lies ~60-65Å away from the PTC. The authors use Ro1 structure as a reference even for analysis of L6M datasets. The reason stated for this selection is that it represents the most abundant class of apo R ribosome and that it is the extreme opposite in terms of both antibiotics bound and presence of uL6 mutation. Although this is true, we feel Lo1 is still probably the “true reference” for the L6M datasets because all the structures bound to the antibiotics have the uL6 mutation. And so it would still be useful to look at the differences between Ro1 and Lo1 followed by re-running the analysis by using Lo1 as a reference instead of Ro1. To improve the overall analysis, the authors should consider combining all data sets and process it as a single dataset so as to obtain a more coherent understanding of the structural changes. This would provide a clearer representation of the latent space and the population differences. CryoDRGN generated maps should then be compared to assess if the conformational distribution is still similar to what has been obtained in the current version of the manuscript. This would be helpful in addressing the potential for generating maps based just on the latent space, focusing on the characteristics that differentiate different states and potentially revealing previously unseen conformational states. We feel that the musical analogy in figure 7E forms a cryptic model because A) It requires an inherent understanding of musical terminologies which is not ideal, and B) We are not sure what the authors exactly mean by retuning and detuning of the conformational landscape as R, L, LK, LT have different conformational landscapes, but the authors assign these to notes that are in ‘harmony’ as explained in the discussion (section titled “the well-temepred ribosome”) which is confusing. Another point regarding the musical analogy is that the terms ‘in-tune’ and ‘out of tune’ should be with reference to a specific property. In principle, it should be based on the conformational landscape but that doesn’t hold true as mentioned above. If this is in reference only to the growth curves, then it means that the structural results haven’t been addressed in the final model. We therefore feel that the authors should come up with a simpler model that is easier to understand and yet includes the results from structures. The authors include the paper by Halfon et al. (2019) in their list of references (23), but perhaps should also include a bit more on the discoveries of that paper and what the unresolved questions were motivating this paper in the introduction. Minor points. There may be a typo about universally conserved nucleotides in the decoding center between E. coli vs P. aeruginosa. (on page 9, line “...the universally E.coli conserved nucleotides A1486 and A1487…” these are supposed to be A1492 and A1493 for E.coli and A1486 and A1487 for P.aeruginosa.) When the term “allosteric activator” is used (in the abstract), it should refer to a series of correlated structural changes due to binding of Tobramycin. This is not explained in the paper. How can we say that the existence of 5 binding sites is a result of “allosteric activation” when there is no explanation about how the different binding sites structurally affect each other (even 2 out of 5)? The color coding for the two antibiotics (T/K - red and CHL - gray) can be seen in the legend but not in figure 7b, . Here, we see the distributions for WT and L6M dataset but not for the datasets with the two antibiotics. Do they superimpose? In figure 4a, please define the color coding in the legend for uL6. Figure citation missing on page 9 (“..the sharp kink observed in the retracted H69 helix eliminates the interactions with h44.”). We are not sure why the LT conformational space is larger than L in Figure 7D because the L dataset clearly had more heterogeneity. Could the authors explain this? The distribution figures presented in the paper could be streamlined to convey the main points more effectively. The authors should clarify the meaning of the left and right distributions, as well as their percentages based on total particles. Considering the potential differences in the data set, displaying the particle distribution on a logarithmic scale could provide a more accurate representation. - Tushar Raskar, Mohamad Dandan and James Fraser",2023-09-10T02:32:25,tushar_r,Tushar R.,10.1101/2023.06.13.544509,Detuning of the Ribosome Conformational Landscape Promotes Antibiotic Resistance and Collateral Sensitivity,"Pablo Mesa, Alicia Jiménez-Fernández, Ruggero La Rosa, Rocio Espinosa, Helle Krogh Johansen, Søren Molin, Guillermo Montoya",2023-06-13

This review resulted from the graduate-level course ""How to Read and Evaluate Scientific Papers and Preprints"" from the University of São Paulo, which aimed to provide students with the opportunity to review scientific articles, develop critical and constructive discussions on the endless frontiers of knowledge, and understand the peer review process. In this preprint Veryard et al. points out that for the past 25 years, ecological research has shown that biodiversity positively impacts ecosystem functions like biomass production when other variables are constant. Earlier experiments focused on grassland plant communities, but newer ones indicate similar benefits in plantations and forests. There's been limited research in tropical environments. This study presents preliminary results from a field-scale experiment in southeast Asia, examining the role of tree species diversity in restoring lowland tropical rainforests. Findings from Sabah, Malaysian Borneo suggest that active restoration, such as tree planting, accelerates forest recovery. This recovery is even more pronounced when using a diverse mix of tree species. The Sabah Biodiversity Experiment, conducted in the Malua forest reserve, involves different restoration methods on 500 ha of logged tropical forest. Observations reveal that the restoration is most effective when a diverse set of tree species is used for replanting. The study supports the idea that the positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning seen in other ecosystems also exists in SE Asia's lowland tropical rainforests. The data are reported in a clear way and the manuscript is well written. Data are consistent with the currently existing literature. Comments ●	About the soil preparation or pre-planting methods, it was highlighted that in one of the treatments the removal of lianas was used. Therefore, it would be interesting to highlight whether controls such as leaf-cutting ants, termites and weeds, fertilization methods and soil correction methods were used or not, even as standard for all treatments. ●	Perhaps the objective of the experiment was not to identify the diversity of species more than 10 years after planting, but considering that there was a survey of data in the field to compare the information from the satellite analysis, it would be interesting to obtain such information to also show that species diversity still exists in the places, since this is also a relevant indicator to consider areas as restored. In addition, this indicator can help to identify potentially monodominant species or even to identify the optimal number of species to be planted to maintain a desired final diversity. ●	It would also be important to highlight in the text the density of individuals planted per area, to reinforce that the increase in the indexes analyzed originated to the diversity of species and not just to a large density of individuals planted per area.",2023-09-06T14:50:01,jefersonlealsilva,Jeferson Leal Silva,10.1101/2022.09.09.507141,Positive effects of tree diversity on tropical forest restoration in a field-scale experiment,"Ryan Veryard, Jinhui Wu, Michael J.

By the expression of the following differential biomarkers, these populations can be divided into two: melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), cocaine, and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART); and orexin, oxytocin, and vasopressin. Excitotoxicity is commonly seen in the population of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum and is the main cause of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease. On the other hand, the nature of the neurodegenerative process found in the hypothalamus remains unknown. Thus, the author's objective was to evaluate the relationship of quinolinic acid (QA)-mediated excitotoxicity in the hypothalamic regions of wild-type and transgenic HD mouse models. Below are my comments about the work: I would like to suggest the authors to remove the term “fatal” or replace it with “progressive” in the abstract and introduction. The fatality, or lethality, results from the knockout of the huntingtin gene ( https://doi.org/10.1242/dev..., while greater numbers of CAG repetition relative to huntingtin’s mutation and homozygote allele are related to early manifestations of symptoms and several clinical courses, respectively ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/W... https://doi.org/10.1093/bra.... In the introduction, I suggest the authors to modify the phrase “Excitotoxicity, i.e., excessive stimulation of the glutamate receptor, …”, as it is glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. This is because excitotoxicity can be conceptualized as cytotoxicity caused by increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations (DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.13-05-02085.1993). Therefore, excitotoxicity can be glutamate-dependent and -independent. We can also observe excitotoxicity when calcium concentrations increase by other pathways that are independent of glutamate receptors. In both cases, there will be a loss of the cell's ability to reestablish the homeostatic balance of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0903546106). In the conclusion topic, I think that could be interesting to further exploring the data obtained from selective excitotoxicity for the MCH-positive neurons. I say this because, although there is no amplification of the QA-induced excitotoxicity effect in the transgenic animals, the observation that the same neurons (i.e., the MCH-positive neurons) naturally undergo neurodegeneration seems to me an indication that the affected neuronal populations can die by different mechanisms; being, however, the MCH-positive neuronal cell death, probably, related to the glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. Thus, the hypothesis that the MCH-positive neuronal population is selectively affected by the glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity cannot be ruled out.",2023-09-05T17:39:31,lucasbonfimmarques,Lucas Bonfim Marques,10.1101/2021.04.08.439100,Effects of excitotoxicity in the hypothalamus in transgenic mouse models of Huntington disease,"Jo B.

The study ""Pain reflects the informational value of nociceptive inputs"" by Michel-Pierre Coll et al. examines the potentiality for the central nervous system to optimize pain’s learning function by being modulated by pain perception. Moreover, the author's hypothesized that nociceptive processing could be augmented when pain is surprising to facilitate predictive learning about pain. To see if this occurs, the authors record nociceptive flexion reflex amplitude combined with electroencephalography to link nociceptive flexion reflex modulation with the influx of ascending nociceptive signals to the cortex. On the electroencephalography they use two indices of expected pain. The first is the late positive potential (peaks around 400-600 ms after the pain-predictive cue). The second is a decrease of oscillatory power in the alpha and beta bands. This seems to be a very powerful take on how pain learning is associated with the expectation of pain. And the combinations of different methods of recording the perception of pain is a novelty in this area, combining the recording of nociceptive flexion reflex modulation amplitude with electroencephalography to link the modulation with the influx of ascending nociceptive information to the cortex. That way the authors can distinguish between the nociceptive responses and perception of pain in the participants and that the predictions errors between anticipated predictions and actual outcomes are associated with the nociceptive flexion reflex. The procedure of the experiment is very well delineated and explained in the text. The statistical analysis is very well explained and appropriate for the problem in hand. Then again, the authors did not specify why they use the three computational models that they choose to use. Although those three computational models are frequently used in studies about uncertainty in perception takes in volatile environments, the justification for their uses are intrinsically different. The justification for the use of a computational model must be a priori unless the study is about the models themselves. All that said, the interpretation for the basis why the Rescorla-Wagner model provided a better fit for the data is very good. Maintaining the environmental volatility relatively high and constant throughout the task due to the regular introduction of new cues is a very good way of simulating actual environmental conditions. Also, they did not say why they used thirty-five participants. Is always recommended to do a pilot to calculate effect and sample size or to justify this quantity from the literature or previous works from the group, published or not. It is argued that this is good enough to reach meaningful conclusions in this specific case. A limitation of this study is the dependence on the connection of the electroencephalography markers used for pain processing to aversive prediction errors that still don't have strong evidence in the literature. The authors make that clear in the text. Meanwhile, combining electroencephalography with functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional near-infrared spectroscopy may give more insights and give more evidence on pain processing to aversive prediction. The results of prediction errors being associated with increased pain perception and physiological pain responses and also with increased anticipatory cortical responses shows that this study is well done and very promising reliability and validity.",2023-09-01T16:20:46,disqus_IhM3mGPyfe,Bernard Costa,10.1101/2023.07.14.549006,Pain reflects the informational value of nociceptive inputs,"Michel-Pierre Coll, Zoey Walden, Pierre-Alexandre Bourgoin, Véronique Taylor, Pierre Rainville, Manon Robert, Dang Khoa Nguyen, Pierre Jolicoeur, Mathieu Roy",2023-07-18

Indeed, current pipelines of defensome analysis (DefenseFinder, Padloc) do not provide sufficient HMMs representative of the large diversity of these systems. They currently mainly focus on PsyrTA, RosmerTA, SanaTA and ShosTA with proven antiphage activity, and argue that ""Toxin-Antitoxin have not been included yet, as there is still some controversy if all members of such families are involved in anti-phage defense"". While the latter is true, there is currently in my view room for the inclusion of more families. Personally, I think that one of the reasons on why this has been delayed, relates partially to the high turnover and dN/dS of several TA genes, which makes it more tricky to build strong HMM models. The latter is something in which our group is actively working at for the eventual release of future analysis tools. In the case of this paper we have stated that our analyses are clearly underestimating the abundance of defense families (for reasons that are highlighted in the Discussion section), but we will definitely make sure to highlight the particular point of TAs (adding appropriate references).

We also thank you for citing three papers from our group. However, I am leaving this comment because our papers were not adequately nor accurately cited in your manuscript. First, we have already shown that asymmetric tension decides a budding direction in J Phys Chem B 126 (2022): 453-462 using our simulations. This is consistent with your findings, and none of your text mentioned this. Second, we have already carried out a large-scale coarse-grained simulation of lipid droplet biogenesis with seipin, published in Elife 11 (2022): e75808. This includes not only nucleation but also maturation and budding. We have further found and discussed the critical role of seipin transmembrane segments in maintaining a neck structure. In particular, based on our simulations, we proposed a mutant construct, which was further validated by experiment in our paper. The final structure of our CG molecular dynamics simulations is consistent with the experimental structure.  In that regard, our work has been cited in your paper only for nucleation but did not receive proper credit for budding and maturation. In particular, we disagree with the following two sentences in your manuscript: ""The function of seipin is also not completely clear: simulations and experiments suggested that it may trap triglycerides (13-15), therefore affecting LD nucleation and growth by ripening, but its localization at the LD-ER contact site raises questions on a possible role also in the budding process.” ""LD nucleation and phase separation were observed in simulations before (7,13,22,23,38), and occur on fast time scales (below the microsecond); in contrast, the budding process has never been observed so far, neither in simulations nor experimentally."" I hope our concerns are properly addressed during revision so that we do not have to write a comment to the journal in which your paper will be published. Thank you.

We collectively agreed it’s an exciting contribution to our understanding of how urbanization reshapes bird communities and their traits. During our discussion, a major point of debate was the ability of the Urban Association Index (UAI) to capture fundamental aspects of urban tolerance. The supplementary material explains important details on how this metric was obtained, but a few questions remained after our discussion. In particular, as the number of records has the potential to influence the mean UAI, widespread, very common species – even if they are equally common in cities and rural areas – may exhibit high UAI mean because most of the records from eBird come from urban areas (i.e., sampling bias). In this scenario, UAI may be amplified for abundant and/or eye-catching species. Perhaps the authors could check the correlation between mean UAI and the number of records to see the nature of this relationship. In this same line of thought, it might be opportune to explore how UAI varies across native vs. invasive species. We understand the reasoning for not differentiating native vs. exotic species (lines 114-116), but for species that were recently introduced through pet trade (e.g., Yellow-crested Cockatoo, Monk Parakeet - which are among those with the highest UAI values), not necessarily UAI is measuring tolerance to urbanization, particularly when their native habitats are not represented in the dataset. We also discussed that a possible approach to illuminate the biological meaning of UAI would be looking at the relationship between mean UAI and variance in UAI. Figure S5 shows how variance varies across species, apparently independent from the mean UAI. In this perspective, for instance, species with high UAI and high variance in UAI tend to be highly associated with cities but also occur in non-urban areas. In turn, species with high UAI and low variance in UAI are strict to cities, and so on. Congrats on the manuscript, and good luck with the next steps of this work!

In this preprint, the authors describe and discuss the structure of a Glycerol-3-phosphate Acyltransferase (GPAT) called PlsB. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the authors have successfully elucidated the complete structure of PlsB from Themomonas haemolytica (ThPlsB). The structural study revealed that ThPlsB forms a symmetric homodimer with three distinct domains in each monomer: the amino-terminal domain (NTD), the middle catalytic domain (MCD), and the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). Additionally, the study identified binding sites for a fatty acyl-CoA molecule and a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DOPA) molecule within the MCD of PlsB. It was also demonstrated that interactions between ThPlsB and the cell membrane involves two exposed amphipathic regions on the surface, located in the NTD and MCD. Based on structural and biochemical analyses, the authors propose a model in which PlsB associates with the membrane surface, coupling its catalytic activity to the biosynthesis of lysophosphatidic acid at the interface between the cell membrane and the cytosol. The data and hypotheses are well presented and written clearly and concisely, and it is an excellent piece of work that provides a new and significant perspective on the structure of PlsB. Major comments ● The outcomes are adeptly presented, offering the reader lucid and succinct comprehension. The executed experiments display a high level of proficiency, and the employed controls that were fittingly selected. This informative exploration of PlsB elucidates numerous structural facets of the enzyme. ● This work provides an excellent insight into the importance of the CTD, NTD, and MCD domains and offers an initial understanding of the aspects mediating the enzyme's interaction with the membrane. There are limitations in CryoEM that prevent the study of the protein bound to lipid bilayers, which justifies the use of micelles and the addition of DOPA. However, considering that the association of PlsB with the membrane is essential for its catalytic activity and that the bilayer association potentially could induce structural changes in the enzyme, possibly even in the active site, I believe that the study could be further enriched by incorporating methodologies aimed at analyzing the impacts on the structure and the aforementioned domains resulting from the protein's binding to LUVs lipid bilayers. ● In addition to the points mentioned earlier it would add value to the manuscript the characterization of the enzymatic activity in the presence of lipid bilayers as well. This would allow for the analysis of how the bilayer and its curvature influence the activity of both the wild-type enzyme and the mutants. Minor comments ● To provide a clearer context for introducing PlsY in the introduction, it might be beneficial to offer more explanatory information. The way it's currently presented could potentially confuse the reader. ● Including a figure illustrating the pathway and highlighting the position of PlsB could greatly enhance the reader's comprehension and appreciation of its importance. ● It could be interesting to perform enzymatic assays with acyl-ACP, another substrate of PlsB. ● The figure 6 could be improved in terms of clarity and didactic presentation in order to most adequately convey and summarize the discussed information to the reader.",2023-08-30T14:42:33,samuelguimarescostapereira,Samuel Guimarães Costa Pereira,10.1101/2023.04.30.538836,"The phospholipid biosynthesis enzyme PlsB contains three distinct domains for membrane association, lysophosphatidic acid synthesis and dimerization","Yumei Li, Anjie Li, Zhenfeng Liu",2023-04-30

Very cool to hear that this preprint was discussed as a part of a graduate course. You raised some very important and interesting points.  Here are some comments on some of them. ○ Indeed,  it would be interesting to look specifically at the BER pathway, being so vital in the repair of oxidative damage; We do have plans to look at PARP1. In the meantime we have performed sequencing and mutational analysis, which confirmed that mitochondrial H2O2 release indeed does not increase the mutation load, while H2O2 production at the histones did. We will include this in the final version of the paper. ○ We recently obtained data showing that the mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration was not impaired to presence or activation of TOM20-DAAO. So it does seem that mitochondrial function is not impaired. We will include it in the final version. ○ I also agree looking at mitochondrial DNA is just as interesting as nuclear DNA, and we are currently working on this. I will make sure that we define more clearly whether we are looking at nuclear or mitochondrial DNA in the final story. The remaining point you make are also valid.

We would like to suggest some possible improvements to be considered by the authors in this preprint stage before it becomes published in a journal. In some parts of the manuscript it is said that mRNA buffering is perfect as total mRNA concentration and even individual mRNA concentrations are invariant. We think that this is overblown. For instance, graphs in Sun et al 2013 (ref. #9; Figure 1), the variability in total mRNA may be as high as 50%. In fact, in García-Martínez et al 2004 (ref. #15; Figure 2) we published that during the carbon source change mRNA concentration changes also by a factor of 2. We wonder if this could be important for the modeling because it seems that on the advantages of the RS model is that it predicts robust buffering, contrarily to previous feedback models. The manuscript misses citation of some papers that we consider important for the field of mRNA buffering, such as Mena et al 2017 (doi: 10.1093/nar/gkx974). This paper is especially relevant because the current preprint describes in the Introduction section that total mRNA concentration is constant as the cell volume increases (refs. 19-22) but forgets to mention this piece of work, which was the first one to show that degradation rate perfectly balances production rate during cell volume change. Instead of our paper, the preprint cites ref. #27, which is 4 years older than Mena et al 2017. Garcia-Martinez et al 2023 (doi: 10.1016/j.bbagrm.2023.194910) is also highly relevant. We described in that article a mathematical model that explains mRNA buffering using a simpler mechanism consisting only one mRNA binding factor that co-transcriptionally imprints mRNAs. That model also predicts that synergistic changes in synthesis and degradation rates will provoke faster and stronger responses, as described in some experiments. We also previously published a multiagent model in Begley et al 2019 (10.1093/nar/gkz660), which combines mRNA imprinting and feedback mechanisms. That paper also demonstrates that Ccr4 and Xrn1 act in parallel with different sets of targets genes. We also have demonstrated in that paper and in other two (Begley et al 2021 doi: 10.1080/15476286.2020.1845504; and  Medina et al 2014 doi: 10.3389/fgene.2014.00001) that protein factors, such as Ccr4 and Xrn1 act not only in transcription initiation level but also in elongation . We think it would be nice this manuscript to discuss the differences of these models with the proposed RS model. Finally, as for the model in Figure 4c, we do not understand why the activation of a degron used by Chappleboim et al 2022 (ref. #16) only degrades cytoplasmic Xrn1 molecules (Xc) and leaves Xp molecules intact. All Xrn1-degron molecules (Xc, Xp, Xn) will be proteolyzed after Auxin addition. This can affect the predictions made by the RS model.",2023-08-30T08:41:17,joseeperez,Jose E Perez-Ortin,10.1101/2023.08.23.554439,Searching the mechanisms of mRNA buffering: the releasing-shuttling model,"Qirun Wang, Jie Lin",2023-08-23

By the expression of the following differential biomarkers, these populations can be divided into two: melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), cocaine, and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART); and orexin, oxytocin, and vasopressin. Excitotoxicity is commonly seen in the population of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum and is the main cause of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease. On the other hand, the nature of the neurodegenerative process found in the hypothalamus remains unknown. Thus, the author's objective was to evaluate the relationship of quinolinic acid (QA)-mediated excitotoxicity in the hypothalamic regions of wild-type and transgenic HD mouse models. Below are my comments about the work: I would like to suggest the authors to remove the term “fatal” or replace it with “progressive” in the abstract and introduction. The fatality, or lethality, results from the knockout of the huntingtin gene ( https://doi.org/10.1242/dev..., while greater numbers of CAG repetition relative to huntingtin’s mutation and homozygote allele are related to early manifestations of symptoms and several clinical courses, respectively ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/W... https://doi.org/10.1093/bra.... In the introduction, I suggest the authors to modify the phrase “Excitotoxicity, i.e., excessive stimulation of the glutamate receptor, …”, as it is glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. This is because excitotoxicity can be conceptualized as cytotoxicity caused by increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations (DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.13-05-02085.1993). Therefore, excitotoxicity can be glutamate-dependent and -independent. We can also observe excitotoxicity when calcium concentrations increase by other pathways that are independent of glutamate receptors. In both cases, there will be a loss of the cell's ability to reestablish the homeostatic balance of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0903546106). In the conclusion topic, I think that could be interesting to further exploring the data obtained from selective excitotoxicity for the MCH-positive neurons. I say this because, although there is no amplification of the QA-induced excitotoxicity effect in the transgenic animals, the observation that the same neurons (i.e., the MCH-positive neurons) naturally undergo neurodegeneration seems to me an indication that the affected neuronal populations can die by different mechanisms; being, however, the MCH-positive neuronal cell death, probably, related to the glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. Thus, the hypothesis that the MCH-positive neuronal population is selectively affected by the glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity cannot be ruled out.",2023-08-27T18:57:22,disqus_vBUn9yN5KM,Lucas Bonfim,10.1101/2023.06.20.545648,Evidence for glutamate excitotoxicity that occurs before the onset of striatal cell loss and motor symptoms in an ovine Huntington’s Disease model,"Andrew Jiang, Linya You, Renee R.

We are Felippe Truglio Machado and Rebeca Bueno-Alves, PhD students at the Department of Biochemistry at University of São Paulo. This article does a really good job demonstrating how mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide affects genomic DNA, with a clear and concise methodology. It puts a perspective on how we should address our concepts when we say how mitochondria oxidant production contributes toward nuclear damage, specifying if it’s a direct or indirect one, something that hasn’t been demonstrated yet. The article aimed to analyze whether hydrogen peroxide produced in mitochondria could potentially contribute directly toward nuclear DNA damage, considering the distance this species would have to travel within the cell. A highly interesting methodology for control induced hydrogen peroxide was developed based on the expression of the enzyme D-Amino Acid Oxidase (DAAO) at different sites within human cells. DAAO was anchored to the outer membrane of the mitochondria or to the nucleosomes. This method proved to be quite promising, particularly regarding its use in studies requiring more continuous or compartmentalized exposure to H2O2, as this could better mimic the physiological cell hydrogen peroxide production, instead of an exogenous burst treatment. This approach is useful for a handful of studies, especially for those focused on mitochondrial DNA integrity. Based on the presented results, the researchers were able to conclude that peroxide formed in mitochondria cannot significantly affect nuclear DNA directly, but they do not rule out the possibility of some indirect impact, warranting further studies in this regard. Although this work really is a great contribution to our current knowledge into mechanisms of oxidative nuclear damage, especially regarding the possibility of its use in future studies, it could really benefit from a different approach in some of its statements. Major comments: ●	The discussion but not in the introduction discuss oxidative DNA lesions and repair by the BER pathway. In the topic “mitochondrial H2O2 release does not induce genomic DNA damage” represented by figure 3, it would be great to assess speciafically BER proteins, which are essential for oxidized base repair. Two additional scenarios must be considered in this situation: one in which the BER pathway is synchronized and single strand breaks are being repaired by POLB as soon as they are generated by glycosylases/ape1, therefore, without much of an increase in single strand breaks. The other one in which the repair proteins are oxidized and repair is not initiated, therefore mutagenic lesions such as 8-oxoG would not impair DNA replication, not inducing cell cycle arrest, which would lead to infidelity of DNA replication instead. So, experiments focused on the BER pathway would help to substantiate the results. Suggestions include measuring OGG1, APE1, or PolB, adding them to the western blot data, or even “BER signaling proteins” such as PARP1. With the present data, we know that peroxide production from the nucleus and mitochondria can cause or not cause nuclear DNA damage (DNA strand breaks), but the mutation rate caused by these types of damage and/or by the mutagenic lesions is not determined. In sync with this line of thought, it would also be interesting to detect damage and survival in the cells after a few days to see how the possible mutations could be established and impact on cell physiology. ●	It would be important to have results that can characterize the experimental model established by the group. In the first figure, they show through the measurement of oxygen consumption that the model was effective in generating H2O2 after the addition of D-Alanine, both in the lineage expressing DAAO in the nucleosomes and in the outer mitochondrial membrane. In order to ascertain whether the addition of the DAAO enzyme with or without D-Ala, by itself, could generate an impact on mitochondrial function or non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption, a comprehensive bioenergetic characterization of the model as a whole would be really beneficial This would ensure that the observed changes are attributable to the specific impact of DAAO and not something indirect through changes in oxidative phosphorylation. ●	The paper could be really improved by adding an assessment of mitochondrial DNA. First, it’s important to differentiate the two genomes. Only nuclear DNA damage was measured, so when DNA damage is mentioned it is important to address this limitation. Second, despite having far less coding genes compared to nuclear DNA, mtDNA oxidative damage and mutation should not be excluded from the discussion. Although mt H2O2 could not contribute directly toward tumorigenesis in the nucleus as stated, it could cause mutations in mtDNA, and this could also have detrimental consequences that should be worth mentioning in the discussion. Also, since the model is already available, future studies analyzing controlled mtDNA damage and mutations caused by peroxide would be a great contribution, since mitochondrial dysfunction caused by impaired mitochondrially-encoded protein synthesis has a big impact in a plethora of disorders. The nuclear genome is of course the main character in cancer, but mtDNA should not be excluded regarding its importance in cell metabolism. Experiments such as detecting mtDNA copy number by PCR and measuring oxygen consumption using different mt complex inhibitors would add a lot to this work, and would provide an overview of H2O2 production by D-Amino Acid Oxidase DAAO impact on mitochondria. In the absence of this data, it's challenging to determine whether any alterations are due to impacts on nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. ●	Regarding the cell survival data, a clonogenic assay and a MTT assay could yield interesting insights and complement the crystal violet data presented in Figure 2. The methods used in the article assessed the effect of H2O2 after 24 hours of treatment, but it would be worthwhile to observe their impact over longer periods. Therefore, a clonogenic assay would be quite valuable to reinforce the data and allow for more comprehensive conclusions, and it also would enable to assess cell survival in a quantitative way. The MTT assay could complement this data since it can be used to analyze cell viability in a mitochondrial metabolism dependent way. ●	Regarding cell death induced by ferroptosis, it would be good if mitochondria-mediated cell death (citC/Caspase9) could be measured, and also mitophagy. Since a lot of damage is being generated in mitochondria it would be interesting to see its impact on other cell death mechanisms and mitochondrial degradation. ●	Some minor statements: ○	Figure 3A could be quantified and presented in graphs for better data visualization ○	In figure 4, the treatment time scale could be aligned to the left like the other figures instead of in the middle.",2023-08-25T18:07:39,felippe_truglio_machado,Felippe Truglio Machado,10.1101/2023.03.29.534749,Mitochondrial H2O2 release does not directly cause genomic DNA damage,"Daan M.K. van Soest, Paulien E.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.04.552078v2#comment-6263319234,biorxivstage,2,"Dear Dr. Germain, Thank you for the insightful comment on our preprint and your important contributions to the singlet detection methodologies. We have considered your response and have addressed your comments below. Comment: First, it's wrong to write that scDblFinder is ""formerly known as doubletCells"". They're two methods developed independently, and it's simply that doubletCells was moved to the same package, but still as an independent method. Response: Thank you for pointing this out. Our confusion stemmed from the fact that doubletCells kept pointing us to the scDblFinder package. Indeed, you are right in that scDblFinder and doubletCells are two different methods. We will revise the manuscript to clarify this point. Comment: Second, your results are in contrast with other benchmarks, which you explain by more ""realistic scRNA-seq datasets"". I'm obviously not entirely disinterested here, but I think this is very misleading: you don't show any evidence that the traditional benchmark datasets do have unrealistic patient or batch effects, and omit to mention the critical fact that, as far as I know, the fatemap samples are homogeneous cell lines, which is far from being more realistic (people do scRNAseq on complex tissues much more often than on cell lines). I think a fairer description would be to abandon the ""realistic/unrealistic"" labels, describe your data as it is, and hence that your observations are basically about homotypic doublets, which the tested methods are very bad at detecting (but also don't claim to do). The lack of real difference between adjacent/distant seems to indicate pretty clearly that you're essentially dealing with homotypic doublets. Response: Thank you for your thorough reading of our preprint and raising these points. First, the point on what are “realistic datasets” is well-taken as it is a subjective descriptor, and, as such, open to interpretation. We will certainly qualify our language appropriately in the revised version; I appreciate you noticing it! Second, homotypic doublets are those from transcriptionally similar cells. As a result, they manifest to different extents or spectrums in both homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets and are a problem regardless of the datasets in question. Third, as a matter of fact, not all FateMap datasets are homogenous. Some of the more heterogeneous datasets are from primary human samples and differentiated cardiomyocytes. Even for those that are homogenous, it is the starting population that is homogenous, not the eventual responses to stimuli/stress, which are quite diverse. Finally, where single-cell sequencing is more useful or implemented is open to interpretation. Of course atlases of diverse tissues and cell types have been useful and continue to be so. Beyond atlases, the continuums of cell identities and rare cell states are of particular interest in a wide-range of biological questions, from cancer to aging to stem cell therapies. We hope the community can use barcoding datasets to study differences which are outwardly subtle, yet can have profound phenotypic impact. Lastly, we do not agree with your statement on “lack of real difference”, as our data clearly shows significant performance improvement for both AUROC and AUPRC for doubletCells (Figure 2E,F). Again, our motivation for testing these methods and showing their lower than reported performance on detecting homotypic doublets is to aid users to choose the method that would work best on their dataset. We thank you for your thorough reading of our preprint, and I am happy to answer any other questions you may have. Feel free to reach me at yogesh.goyal@northwestern.edu.

This work is aimed to explore the conformation preference in LLPS especially at interface by a homopolymer model. But the dense phase has more than 1000 mg/ml concentration, it seems like a pure component polymer droplet without water, should we call it LLPS/condensates, or polymer melt? 2. From the single-chain Rg distribution, the homopolymer used in this work would collapse. From polymer field view, this polymer has bad solvent quality with exponent coefficient v<0.5 in dilute phase, but in highly concentrated polymer melt, polymer has solvent quality with exponent coefficient v=0.5, so it will expand when entering polymer melt phase. Also the interface region in your work could be viewed as semi-dilute phase. Your result is similar with what's illustrated in polymer field before. But was it suitable for LLPS? 3.
