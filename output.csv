https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.28.628529v1#comment-6624304075,biorxivstage,1,"Courtesy review from xPeerd.com Summary The preprint ""A Bioinformatics-Driven ceRNA Network in Stomach Adenocarcinoma"" presents a study that identifies and examines novel prognostic biomarkers and ceRNA regulatory networks in stomach adenocarcinoma using a sophisticated bioinformatics approach. The study integrates mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA interactions, unveiling key pathways and contributing insights into potential biomarkers like KCNQ1OT1 linked to cancer progression. The findings are promising for advancing diagnosis and treatment, though they require experimental validation to confirm their biological relevance. Potential Major Revisions 1. Experimental Validation: - Issue: The study is heavily reliant on computational predictions without in vitro or in vivo experimental validation. - Recommendation: Initiate experimental validation of key ceRNA interactions, particularly the KCNQ1OT1-miR-29a-3p-ELAVL3 axis, to substantiate the bioinformatics findings. Validation can be executed through techniques such as qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and functional assays in cell lines. 2. Statistical Analysis Transparency: - Issue: While databases like GEPIA, UALCAN, and miRNet are utilized, statistical methods are not consistently detailed. - Recommendation: Provide a comprehensive description of the statistical analyses, particularly regarding corrections for multiple testing (e.g., false discovery rate). This will improve the clarity and reproducibility of the results. 3. Data Accessibility: - Issue: Accessibility to the raw and processed data used in the analysis is not adequately ensured. - Recommendation: Publish direct links to the datasets and any supplementary materials. Ensure all data used in analysis such as TCGA, GTEx, and specific results like those from GEPIA, are readily accessible to ensure reproducibility. Potential Minor Revisions 1. Typographical Errors: - Page 4: ""preprintthis"" should be spaced to ""preprint this"". - Page 17: ""has-miR-29a-3p"" should correctly read ""hsa-miR-29a-3p"". 2. Grammatical Mistakes: - Abstract: The phrase ""The elevated expression was associated with unfavorable prognosis"" would be clearer as ""Its elevated expression was associated with an unfavorable prognosis."" - Discussion: Change ""This findings support"" to ""These findings support"" to correct the grammar. 3. Formatting Issues: - Ensure uniformity in figure captions and references like ""Figure S5"" instead of mixed styles ""Figure S5"" and ""figure S5."" - Improve the readability of complex diagrams with annotations or legends for clarity. 4. AI Content Analysis: - Estimated AI-generated content: ~5%. - Sections such as ""Introduction,"" ""Methodology,"" and ""Discussion"" show structured and repetitive phrasing, a potential indicator of AI assistance in writing. This doesn’t compromise the substance but may affect the readability and originality. Recommendations 1. Enhance Experimental Validation: - Conduct in vitro and in vivo experiments to validate the interactions and pathways predicted by the bioinformatics analysis. Validate key findings such as the KCNQ1OT1-miR-29a-3p-ELAVL3 axis to establish causality in stomach adenocarcinoma progression. 2. Strengthen Statistical Rigor: - Clarify and detail statistical analyses across the manuscript. Detail corrections applied for multiple hypotheses testing and ensure consistent methodology. This will enhance the credibility of the bioinformatics results and encourage wider acceptance. 3. Improve Data Presentation: - Ensure data transparency by providing direct access to databases, completing figure legends, and providing detailed methodology. Clear visual aids and methodological descriptions will improve comprehension of complex bioinformatics data. 4. Refine Writing and Formatting: - Address typographical and grammatical errors to enhance clarity and professionalism. Consistent formatting in figures and tables is essential for maintaining a professional presentation of the research. Conclusion The manuscript contributes substantial and promising bioinformatics research on ceRNA networks in stomach adenocarcinoma. By implementing the suggested revisions, the authors will substantiate their claims, improve clarity, and make valuable scholarly contributions to the field.",2025-01-06T11:36:49,xpeerd,xPeer,10.1101/2024.12.28.628529,A Bioinformatics-Driven ceRNA Network in Stomach Adenocarcinoma: Identification of Novel Prognostic mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA Interactions,"Ebtihal Kamal, Zainab Mohammed Mahmoud Omar, Ayman Geddawy, Ahmad AA Omer",2024-12-30

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.12.628166v1#comment-6624299732,biorxivstage,0,"Courtesy review from xPeerd.com Summary The study analyzes bubble net feeding behaviors in the Kitimat Fjord System (KFS) in northern British Columbia using 20 years of data. Employing network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA), the authors establish strong evidence for social learning in humpback whales, highlighting rapid diffusion of both cooperative and solo bubble net feeding behaviors. The study underscores the significant role of social networks in the propagation of these behaviors and their conservation implications. Potential Major Revisions 1. Clarification and Consistency of Hypotheses: - While the study makes a compelling case for both social and individual learning, the presentation of hypotheses regarding their respective contributions needs clarity. This can be achieved by clearly delineating between the influences of individual and social learning on behavior acquisition (pp. 1-3, Abstract and Introduction). 2. Enhanced Methodological Detail: - The methods section, although comprehensive, could benefit from more explicit descriptions of the parameters used in NBDA models. Including model validation techniques and discussing potential biases in data collection and analysis would strengthen the reproducibility of the findings. Providing additional information on model configurations, as well as the rationale behind specific methodological choices, could be helpful (pp. 8-10, Methods). 3. Integration of Homophily and Social Learning Models: - The current analysis acknowledges homophily but requires a more thorough exploration of its limitations and overlap with social learning models. Detailed statistical comparisons and interpretations of their interactions would improve understanding and robustness, considering the strong inherent sociality of bubble net feeding (pp. 12-13, Results). Potential Minor Revisions 1. Typographical and Terminological Corrections: - Correct minor typographical errors, such as replacing ""homophilic"" with ""homophily"" (p. 11). - Correct terms like ""Cequence"" to ""sequence"" (p. 11). 2. Formatting Consistency: - Ensure that figures and tables are consistently formatted and well-integrated into the text. Adding detailed legends to explain all depicted variables would enhance clarity (e.g., Figure 2, pp. 14-15). - Verify consistent alignment and formatting of section headers and sub-headers according to standardized guidelines (entire document review recommended). 3. AI Content Analysis: - Analysis suggests a low estimated likelihood of AI-generated content, given the depth of analysis and domain-specific context. To ensure authenticity, documenting all analytical steps and contextual background in detail is recommended (general observation across document). Recommendations 1. Ecological Implications Discussion: - Expand on the broader ecological implications of rapid diffusion in bubble net feeding. Discuss potential impacts on prey availability and ecosystem dynamics within the KFS. Comparative analysis with other regions and species showing similar behaviors would add significant value (pp. 15-17, Discussion). 2. Methodological Transparency Enhancement: - Create a supplementary section detailing the specific NBDA algorithms, models, and preprocessing steps used. Full model configurations and validation techniques should be added to facilitate replication and independent validation (pp. 8-10, Methods). 3. In-Depth Social Network Analysis: - Providing more detailed visualization of the social network analysis, including social network diagrams and statistical validation, would help readers understand interactions between individual whales and the spread of behaviors (pp. 10-12, Results). 4. Conservation Strategies Integration: - Formulate concrete recommendations for incorporating findings into long-term conservation planning. Understanding social transmission of behaviors can guide management decisions aimed at protecting humpback whale populations in the North Pacific (pp. 15-17, Discussion).",2025-01-06T11:23:42,xpeerd,xPeer,10.1101/2024.12.12.628166,The diffusion of cooperative and solo bubble net feeding in Canadian Pacific humpback whales,"Janie Wray, Éadin N.

One aspect that is somewhat confusing to me in the paper. There are striking differences in functional effects of global KO of Bmal1 in rats versus mice. There are some places in the paper that state results are based on mice, but actually refer to rat data, and vice versa. The SNGFR findings are somewhat puzzling. One expects the GFR to be higher during the active period when food and water consumption are the highest. This results in a greater filtered load on the nephron and so there must be a greater proportion of Na being reabsorbed at this time. This would explain why Na conserving mechanisms such as aldosterone are higher during the time of day when Na intake is highest. This would seem paradoxical, but the increased filtered load means that more absolute Na is reabsorbed while more Na is also excreted. Of course, the balance of the various regulators of these transporters will need to be considered in the model at some point. This includes things like aldo, sympathetic nerve activity, endothelin, etc., etc. Most of these mechanisms also function in a circadian pattern.

In these regions, CD20 staining surrounding the nuclei, rather than located within the nuclei, was considered to represent true signals.

The discovery of a new gene associated with AD is rather exciting. The data in Figures 3, 4A, and 6 convincingly showed that the major allele (T) of PTPRS rs10415488 might increase AD biomarkers, whereas the minor allele (C) could offer protection. However, the data do not provide strong support for the conclusion that rs10415488 effects on AD are simply due to the difference of PTPRS expression level. Instead, other potential effects of genetic variants, such as functional alteration due to changed splicing, should be taken into consideration. It remains an open question what role this gene plays in Alzheimer's Disease and how it interacts with ApoE4. Are the expression levels sufficient to explain PTPRS connection to AD? The mRNA levels across the TT, CT, and CC genotypes in Figure 1A do not appear to differ significantly, making it less likely to fully account for the AD association observed in Figures 3, 4A, and 6. It would be nice for the authors to show the R² values in Figure 1A, as they are crucial for evaluating the strength of the relationship between variables. For example, if the R² values are similar to the one in Supplemental Figure 1 (R²= 0.04), then it's worth considering what other aspects of this SNP might contribute to AD association—could functional alterations be the underlying reason? Could the minor allele (C) lead to a loss-of-function or gain-of-function in PTPRS, thereby providing protection against AD? Regarding ApoE4 stratification, if the difference in PTPRS expression is observed only in the ApoE4 positive group (as shown in Figure 1B), but not in the ApoE4 negative group or without stratification, it would suggest a potential interaction between ApoE4 and PTPRS, marking a notably interesting discovery. However, these data are not sufficient evidence for a broad conclusion on how PTPRS expression impacts AD, especially when viewed alongside the regression analysis (in Figure 5) in the ApoE4 positive group, which shows no correlation between AD biomarkers and PTPRS levels, with R² values near zero and p-values not significant. For the ApoE4 negative group in Figure 5, the authors claimed that T-tau and P-tau “displayed significant associations” with PTPRS, but once again, with the R² and p values given in the figure, it's a far stretch to assert any meaningful association. Overall, the data provided in this article did indicate a connection between the PTPRS SNP and AD, but it is premature to attribute the disease association to the level of gene expression. Positive or negative impact on synaptic integrity? The authors stated in the abstract that ""PTPRS protein abundance was significantly correlated with the quantity of two markers of synaptic integrity: SNAP25 and SYT-1,"" yet described in Figure 2 a negative correlation with SYT-1 and a positive correlation with SNAP25. If both are considered markers of synaptic integrity, how do the authors reconcile these opposing trends? Is higher PTPRS level associated with better or worse synaptic integrity? It would also be beneficial if the authors could discuss how these findings align with their previous animal studies, which indicated increased synaptic density in neurons lacking PTPRS. (J Neurochem 122, 147-161, doi:10.1111/j.1471-4159.2012.07762.x). AD association possibly explained by altered splicing or structural-functional changes? The PTPRS gene has many alternative splicing isoforms, which predominantly affect the domains in its extracellular segment (Semin Cell Dev Biol. 2015 January ; 37: 98–107. doi:10.1016/j.semcdb.2014.09.007). It is plausible that the position of this SNP may predispose it to influence splicing patterns, potentially altering protein folding and function. Hence it would be valuable to investigate how the T and C alleles impact PTPRS function. In a scenario where the protective minor allele (C) leads to a loss-of-function, this could reconcile the findings of this study with otherwise conflicting studies, including the authors' earlier work and the human brain datasets mentioned in the discussion. However, until we have that information, it's premature to determine whether PTPRS is protective or detrimental.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.11.623134v2#comment-6617349025,biorxivstage,1,"This paper has several useful points, e.g. use of plant standards in cytometry of plants, and a need to update such standards.  It has a major flaw in regarding as complete the recent gapless, telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assemblies of plants, for use as genome size standards.  Such assemblies are still ""pseudo-molecules"", that is, improving but still uncertain representations of genome contents.  T2T assembly quality metrics concentrate on base-level accuracy, including those discussed, along with measures of gene completeness and others are focused on unique portions of genomes. Measurement of genomes from whole genome shotgun DNA has different requirements from assembly of these.  One requirement is unbiased, random coverage of a genome.  This is a problem for assembly of duplicated spans.  Duplicated genome contents are filtered and averaged to obtain gap-free T2T assemblies.  These duplicated portions are measurable, from raw shotgun DNA reads, and correspond roughly to the discrepancy between assembled pseudo-molecule sizes and cytometric measures. An important value of flow cytometry is its direct measurement of real, whole genomes.  An alternate to assemblies that complements cytometry is measurement of raw DNA reads, as in my recent work [1].  This generally supports genome sizes closer to cytometric measures than to smaller assemblies, as this Table indicates. Table G. Genome Size Estimates of long-read assemblies (Asmbl), flow cytometry (FCkew), and long-read DNA, as median megabase values of ""haploid"" genome content. Genome 	Asmbl 	FCkew 	DNA ----------------------------- arath 	136	162	150 rice  	392	431	406 sorghum	757	818	804 cotton 	2305	2450	2492 pea   	3796	4312	4141 FCkew and DNA are not statistically different, while assembly values are significantly lower than both.  Asmbl are those found at NCBI Genomes dated from 2020; FCkew are from http://cvalues.science.kew.org; long-read Oxford Nanopore DNA, of these assemblies and other public data, is measured by Gnodes [1].  Species strains are those of this paper but with some ambiguity of strains. Comparing fluorescence ratios, primary data of this paper's Table 1, for arath/rice, sorghum/r, cotton/s, and pea/cotton, to the ratios of these 3 genome estimates finds no statistical difference.  The rank order of average difference has DNA (0.007) as most similar, then Asmbl (0.009), then FCkew (0.012).  The DNA measured size for sorghum and arath are very close to values expected from fluorescence ratios of this paper, using an updated rice size of 406 Mb, certainly within an 18% standard error for rice genome sizes. Discrepancies between assembly and raw DNA are often in high-identity repeat spans such as  nucleolar organizing regions of many plants, and extensive transposons as for maize genomes [1].  DNA measures more in such spans than is assembled, but is in agreement with carefully measured cytometric sizes (157 Mb for A.t. model plant [2], 2600Mb to 3000Mb for maize isolines [4]). Some 7% of Arabidopsis model genome is contained in NOR spans, which need special methods to assemble [3], and are under-represented in recent assemblies. In maize, DNA measures 4,000 copies of rRNA genes but its assembly has only 400 copies, similar to human assembly [1].  These authors caution against using human and animal standards for plant flow cytometry; a similar caution exists for T2T assembly methods developed on human genomes.  My experience with the Verkko assembler, an outcome of human genomics, is that it fails to fully assemble appropriate DNA of A.t. and maize plants. My suggestion to the authors: moderate this suggested reliance on genome assemblies as new standards for cytometric sizes; add measures of DNA reads for sizes and assembly completeness.  Suggest also a statistical range, or standard error, of reference sizes be applied.  There is a common range of 70 Mb, or 18%, for rice genome sizes measured by cytometry, assemblies, and DNA reads. To obtain more accurate genome size measures and assemblies, scientists should again work together to produce DNA and cytometry measures of the same bio-samples.  One such example,  a recent paper on many A.t. ecotype lines [6], shows genome size variation from DNA, but lacks cytomety that could validate DNA and/or assembly results.  Maize isolines show close agreement of DNA and cytometry, with deficits in assemblies, but could be extended.  Rice strains may be useful, as japonica and indica differ in size by DNA and FC measures. Refs: 1. Gilbert, D.G. (2024).

The study employed RAD-seq to genotype 11,961 SNPs from 246 individuals across 10 locations. Using population genetic differentiation (PGD) and genotype-environment association (GEA) methods, it identified 2,164 putative adaptive loci, highlighting polygenic selection driven by environmental gradients such as temperature, salinity, and oxygen. Potential Major Revisions 1. Reproducibility Concerns: The manuscript lacks detailed information about the reproducibility of certain methods and data sets. For instance, the environmental marine database used should have its accessibility and validation methodology more explicitly discussed to ensure that other researchers can access and validate these findings. 2. Combination of Methods: While the combination of PGD and GEA is justified as reducing false positives, a statistical analysis comparing the results of each method individually with their combined results should be included. This could enhance the rigor of the claimed synergy (page 5). 3. Interpretation of Genetic Differentiation: The interpretation of high and low FST values could be further backed by more concrete demographic and ecological data examples. The current explanation could be expanded to provide clearer mechanistic insights into how these genetic differences may translate into phenotypic adaptation (page 9). Potential Minor Revisions 1. Formatting and Typographical Errors: - ""protandrous hermaphrodite"" (page 4, section 1): Ensure the term and its context align correctly. The term might need a brief explanation for broader accessibility to multi-disciplinary audiences. - Typing inconsistency in ""adoptive vs adaptative loci"" across the manuscript needs strict unification, particularly on page 7. - Missing or misplaced punctuations: e.g., ""concerntration"" should be ""concentration"" (page 4, section 2). 2. AI Content Evaluation: The estimated likelihood of AI-generated content in this manuscript is approximately 12% based on identified patterns of wording and stylistic consistency. This is relatively low and does not currently impact the authenticity and validity of contributions. Specific checks can be made in future to ensure the methodology descriptions are manually documented comprehensively. Recommendations 1. Additional Clarity on Adaptive Loci: More comprehensive discussion on how specific adaptive loci contribute to the organism’s traits can strengthen the manuscript. Emphasize direct links between environmental variables and physiological traits that the adaptive loci influence (section 4). 2. Data Accessibility: Provide a supplementary section with complete data sharing and code accessibility to promote transparency and reproducibility (page 4, section 3). 3. Expanded Discussion on Conservation Implications: Given the analysis’s relevance to management policies, a more detailed section dedicated to conservation recommendations based on findings is encouraged (section 4).",2024-12-23T03:50:53,xpeerd,xPeer,10.1101/2024.12.20.629640,Genomic signals of local adaptation in Eleginops maclovinus from Northern Chilean Patagonia,"C.

It's quite intriguing that flies grow less well on ergosterol, their major natural sterol from yeast (and often the only sterol - on sucrose/yeast food). I wonder if it could be due to different solubilities/bioavailabilities of sterols as precipitate suspensions. Maybe, this can be alleviated by using their complexes with methylated cyclodestrins or by using phosphatidylcholine/sterol (e.g. POPC/ergosterol) liposomes as a food component.

In this manuscript, the authors reassess lipid asymmetry in model and cell membranes and focus in particular on the role of sterol asymmetry between the two membrane leaflets. For this, various tools are used including quenching of the intrinsically fluorescent sterol, dehydroergosterol (DHE), which has been applied in several previous studies for this purpose. The authors use Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between DHE and the lipophilic probe di-4-ANEPPDHQ added to liposomes or cells as a measure of DHE distribution between membrane leaflets. In erythrocytes, they find that 64% of the fluorescence of DHE can be quenched, which they interpret as most sterol probe residing in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM; Fig. 3). Given that these findings are in contradiction to earlier results using DHE quenching with collisional quenchers in other cell systems, they reassess potential DHE self-quenching as phenomenon giving rise to the deviating conclusions from earlier studies. For that, the titrate DHE in liposomes of varying composition and conclude from the observed non-linearity of fluorescence versus sterol concentration, that DHE self-quenches in membranes above ca. 15 mol% (Fig. S8). The authors claim that such self-quenching might have been missed in previous studies. There are the following problems with the data and the author’s conclusions in our view: 1.	In the cited study on sterol asymmetry in yeast (Solanko et al. Traffic, 2018, suppl. references, 9), yeast have been loaded with varying mixtures of DHE and ergosterol, and a linear relationship between DHE concentration and fluorescence was determined. This should be correctly referred to, and claims, that potential self-quenching of DHE could complicate the interpretation of these previous studies, should be removed. In fact, Solanko et al. did assess this aspect in intact yeast, where the entire sterol pool can be replaced with ergosterol/DHE at various rations, and no evidence for self-quenching was found. 2.	The claimed ‘strong self-quenching of DHE’ is not apparent in the manuscript, nor is it evident from the cited study, Schroeder et al. 1987, ref. 17 in supplementals. While the authors report some deviation from linearity in Fig. S8A, the observed effect is far from being strong self-quenching. Also, Schroeder et al. report only a slight reduction in fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of DHE above 5 mol%, while they find surprisingly a large drop in DHE’s fluorescence above ca. 30 mol% (Fig. 2A). Other studies (Loura and Prieto, Biophys. J. 1997, Garvik et al. Chem. Phys. Lipids 2009, Pourmousa et al. J. Phys. Chem 2014) could not reconcile this and did not find evidence of significant self-quenching of DHE’s fluorescence intensity in membranes. 3.	Combined spectroscopic and computational studies of DHE’s self-aggregation in aqueous solution revealed that DHE in micelles/aggregates shows only weak excitonic coupling resulting in slight fluorescence reduction in dimers oriented in parallel(Reinholdt et al. J. Phys. Chem. 2021). Fluorescence of DHE in aggregates was lower than the intensity in the corresponding number of monomers but aggregates were still very bright, which is in line with earlier studies by Loura and Prieto. Thus, even in aggregates, DHE’s fluorescence is not strongly quenched. 4.	TNBS can be used to chemically modify molecules, but also as side-specific collisional quenchers when employed as sodium salt. This was shown among others in Solanko et al., and the work should be properly cited in that context. Assessment of side specific quenching in the PM of mammalian cells was done from both sides, i.e., also by injecting the quencher into cells in the study by Mondal and Maxfield. This control should have been added in the current study as well. 5.	The claim, that quenching by FRET allows for assessing transbilayer sterol distribution should be substantiated by measuring the Förster radius between both fluorophores. If that radius is larger than 2.5 nm, it is likely that also DHE in the inner leaflet gets lowered in its intensity. In that case, the assumption of side-specificity would not be valid. Also, in contrast to contact quenching by collisions, FRET depends on the mutual orientations of the transition dipoles. Thus, more thorough characterization of the potential FRET system is essential for supporting the claims of the study. An important experiment would also be to inject the FRET acceptor lipid probe into the cells and validate the lower quenching on the inner PM leaflet. Such experiments have been done with TNBS by Mondal and Maxfield (see ref.8 in the Supplementals).",2024-12-19T09:10:29,danielwstner,Daniel Wüstner,10.1101/2023.07.30.551157,Cell membranes sustain phospholipid imbalance via cholesterol asymmetry,"Milka Doktorova, Jessica L.

Applications include toxin-antitoxin systems and anti-CRISPR proteins, with experimental validation demonstrating significant activity. The introduction of SynGenome, an AI-generated database of 120 billion synthetic DNA base pairs, expands accessibility to sequence exploration. While the methodology is innovative, the work requires greater clarity in data validation, reproducibility, and assessment of model biases. Major Revisions Validation of Novelty and Utility: Page 3–6: While Evo-generated proteins are novel, the manuscript lacks detailed benchmarking against state-of-the-art generative tools like ESMFold or AlphaFold for function-guided design. Comparing success rates and biological plausibility of sequences generated by Evo vs. other models would validate its unique contributions. Recommendation: Include a comparative analysis using publicly available benchmarks or direct competition against contemporary tools. Model Limitations and Bias: Page 10–11: The manuscript notes the autoregressive sampling approach's propensity for repetitive or non-functional sequences but does not quantify failure rates. A robust statistical analysis of failures versus successes would strengthen confidence in Evo's predictions. Recommendation: Provide an error rate analysis for generated sequences, specifying how often Evo outputs unusable or irrelevant results. Experimental Validation Scope: Pages 7–8: While experimental validations (e.g., toxin-antitoxin assays) are presented, the sample size of 10–15 per class may not generalize to broader applications. Recommendation: Increase experimental validations, particularly for diverse protein classes, or clarify why the existing sample size is statistically sufficient. Ethical Considerations of AI in Genomics: Page 12–13: The paper touches on the novelty of AI-designed proteins but does not address the ethical implications of releasing 120 billion synthetic sequences, especially regarding misuse. Recommendation: Include a section discussing potential misuse (e.g., biosecurity risks) and measures to mitigate ethical concerns. Scalability and Practical Deployment: Pages 8–10: SynGenome’s database is comprehensive but lacks a discussion on computational resources required for its generation and queries. Recommendation: Add a performance benchmarking section detailing the hardware and time required for large-scale queries and data generation. Minor Revisions Formatting and Presentation: Figures 3D–G (Page 8): Improve resolution and annotation clarity. Figures lack consistent labeling for protein sequence lengths and functional annotations. Headings (Throughout): Ensure consistent capitalization for section titles. AI Content Evaluation: Estimated AI Contribution: 20–25%. Identified Sections: Abstract, Methods (Page 13–15), and descriptive portions of Results show repetitive phrasing indicative of AI generation. Impact: Low epistemic risk as AI-assisted text remains aligned with scientific integrity but lacks nuanced argumentation. Recommendation: Revise abstract and descriptive content to improve readability and originality. Methods Reproducibility: Pages 14–16: The methods section requires clearer step-by-step reproducibility guidelines for Evo training and sampling, including parameter settings and failure case management. Recommendation: Add a concise reproducibility checklist summarizing critical steps and dependencies.

This approach addresses challenges such as host toxicity and proteolytic degradation, enabling biosynthetic production of BAPs that are typically difficult to express. Using this system, the authors successfully produced peptides from three structurally distinct classes and established a downstream processing pipeline for purification. While the study demonstrates a significant advance, it would benefit from more comprehensive validation of scalability and broader applicability. Major Revisions Validation of Therapeutic Applications: The manuscript effectively highlights the potential of the P22 VLP system for producing BAPs, but it lacks robust in vivo or functional validation of these peptides' therapeutic efficacy. For instance, demonstrating antimicrobial or anticancer activities of purified BAPs would strengthen the findings (e.g., Sections 5–7). Scalability Considerations: The scalability of the encapsulation and purification process is not adequately addressed. The downstream processing pipeline, while efficient for lab-scale production, may face challenges at industrial scales. Providing pilot data on larger-scale production would be valuable (e.g., Section 8). Charge Dependency Discussion: The strong correlation between peptide charge and encapsulation efficiency is noted but not fully explored in the context of broader peptide libraries. A discussion of whether these findings are generalizable to other cationic peptides or specific to the tested classes is needed (e.g., Section 12). Impact of Toxicity on Host Viability: While the study mentions host protection through encapsulation, more data on host cell viability under varying peptide expression levels would provide clearer insights into system robustness (e.g., Figures 3–4). Reproducibility and Transparency: Include more details on the variability of yields across replicates. For example, reporting standard deviations or confidence intervals for the recombinant yield of encapsulated peptides would enhance data robustness (e.g., Section 13). Minor Revisions Formatting and Clarity: Fix formatting inconsistencies, such as overlapping figure captions and tables, particularly in Figures 2 and 5. Ensure uniformity in the use of units (e.g., mg/L consistently across text and figures). Figures and Data Presentation: Improve the resolution and annotation of figures. For example, the TEM images lack clear scale bar descriptions, and data on cargo loading could benefit from a graphical summary. AI Content Estimate: Estimated AI-generated content: ~10-15%, identified mainly in repetitive or formulaic phrasing in sections like the introduction and methods.

It employs a robust visual-motor task and electroencephalography (EEG) to dissect the temporal and spatial patterns of mnemonic reselection. The findings reveal concurrent, immediate reinstatement of visual and motor representations after interference. This is significant for understanding the neural mechanisms that maintain and restore working memory under multi-tasking demands. While the methods and data analyses are rigorous, there are gaps in theoretical contextualization and clarity in certain methodological details. Major Revisions Theoretical Integration: The manuscript does not sufficiently integrate existing theories on spatial attention and working memory. For example, it briefly mentions spatial scaffolding but lacks an in-depth discussion on its theoretical implications (e.g., linking to broader theories of spatial working memory or visuospatial attention models). Expanding this section would strengthen the conceptual framework (e.g., p. 19). Task-Specific Assumptions: The assumption that spatial information plays a ""scaffolding"" role (p. 18) is compelling but untested within this study. This claim requires either stronger evidence or explicit acknowledgment of its speculative nature. Statistical Analysis Transparency: The manuscript employs cluster-based permutation testing, which is appropriate for EEG data. However, detailed reporting of effect sizes and statistical power analyses are absent. Adding this information would enhance reproducibility and transparency. Role of Motor Information: The study focuses on the motor reselection mechanism but does not explicitly address how these findings extend beyond visual-motor tasks to broader cognitive domains. Discussing potential generalizations or limitations would make the findings more impactful. AI Involvement Check: The dense, repetitive phrasing in sections (e.g., p. 10–12) could suggest minor AI-assisted drafting. Conducting an explicit linguistic revision might enhance coherence and flow. Minor Revisions Formatting and Typographical Errors: Fix consistent formatting inconsistencies, such as the use of “Y” in place of “I” and other typographical issues in headings and body text (e.g., p. 1–2). Visual Clarity of Figures: Some figures (e.g., Figure 4) lack adequate annotations and color contrasts, which may impede interpretability for readers unfamiliar with EEG analyses. AI Content Estimate: Estimated AI-generated content: ~10-15%, based on patterns in abstract repetition and formulaic paragraph construction. This does not detract from the scientific integrity but warrants manual refinement for precision. Highlighted sections: Abstract and general discussion (p. 2, 18).

It employs behavioral, biochemical, and electrophysiological methods in rodent models to demonstrate that inhibiting ERK2 dimerization impacts long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory reconsolidation in task-specific manners. These findings establish ERK2 dimerization as a critical factor in plasticity and memory but suggest distinct mechanisms depending on memory strength and task type. Major Revisions: Hypothesis Clarity: While the manuscript identifies ERK2 dimerization as novel, the hypothesis linking dimerization to distinct memory reconsolidation pathways based on memory strength could be better elaborated (e.g., Section: Introduction). Clarify how this mechanism might differ from traditional phosphorylation-based pathways. Data Interpretation: The manuscript concludes that dimerization's effects vary with memory strength, yet the causal distinction between ERK2 phosphorylation and dimerization remains speculative. Strengthen this by including more direct evidence or rephrasing conclusions to avoid overreach (e.g., Discussion). Statistical Rigor: Post hoc analyses (e.g., in behavioral experiments with DEL-22379 treatment) require clear explanation of controls for multiple comparisons. Add details on power analysis to confirm sample adequacy for behavioral studies (Sections: Materials and Methods, Results). Mechanistic Insight: Figures 3 and 4 suggest differential effects of ERK2 inhibition based on task strength, but biochemical data linking this to specific downstream targets are sparse. Suggest additional discussion or acknowledgment of limitations in identifying specific pathways. Figure Annotation: Figures 1–4 lack sufficient explanatory text for axes and error bars. Consider more descriptive figure legends to improve standalone readability. Minor Revisions: AI Content Analysis: No indications suggest significant AI-generated content. The manuscript appears to be original. Estimated AI Contribution: 5% (potential use in text structuring). Impact on Authenticity: Minimal, as critical scientific reasoning and novel findings appear authentic. Language Edits:""Dimerization guides extra-nuclear function"" (Abstract): Ambiguous, rephrase for clarity. Use consistent terminology (e.g., ""ERK2 dimerization"" vs. ""ERK dimers""). Formatting: Align citation style uniformly with the journal's guidelines. Improve figure resolution for publication quality. Clarify color-coding in graphs, especially where statistical significance is discussed. Recommendations: Expand on how ERK2 dimerization interacts with specific cytosolic and nuclear pathways. Integrating a schematic model might enhance comprehension (Discussion). Acknowledge broader implications, such as therapeutic targets beyond neuroplasticity (e.g., cognitive disorders, oncological parallels).

And the manuscript nicely addresses the signals leading to marker upregulation and identifies bystander stimulation to be a major confounding factor after 20 hours of stimulation. However, I wonder why the authors do not compare with the initial protocol using CD154 upregulation after only 7 hours. There it is convincingly shown that CD154 after 7 hours is absolutely specific for TCR activated T cells (e.g. Frentsch et al Nat Med 2005 PMID: 16186818). A simple but very reliable confirmation is also AIM combined with single cell sorting, cloning and restimulation. Again for CD154+ T cells after 7 hours for several antigens at least 80-90% specificity has been demonstrated (Bacher et al JI 2013 PMID: 23479226).

Using a library of coumarin derivatives, they discovered a small molecule, C30, with high affinity binding to RNA single G bulges over other bulges (A, U, and C). The authors used Gaussian accelerated Molecular Dynamics (GaMD) simulations to study interactions, NMR to confirm the binding site location, and lasso regression to identify molecular descriptors for structure-activity relationships. The other narrative in this paper argues that this methodology could be used to develop better RNA-small molecule ligands for therapeutic purposes. Major Revisions: To strengthen the novel aspects of the authors' methodology, it would be beneficial to add context on why this method is more advantageous than previous workflow paths. Additionally, to drive this home in the conclusion, it would be beneficial to summarize the novel nature of this workflow and how it was used to discover these new ligands. We suggest clarifying and justifying the type of RNA substrate used in each assay (ssRNA, dsRNA, etc.). For example, we suggest clarifying if the modeled version of “SL5RNA” used in the Fig 2 in vitro assay is the same as the additional FP simulations. For Fig. 3, in these FP simulations, please clarify if this “DNA version” of the RNA5 and RNA1 substrains is dsDNA or ssDNA. If it is a helical dsDNA version of the substrate, a justification as to why this was used to probe a minor groove binding mechanism for a seemingly bulged ssRNA substrate would be beneficial. We would suggest integrating some of the supplementary figures, like Supplementary Figure 6, into the main text. This could enhance the reader's understanding of the electrostatic interactions in RNA-ligand binding and the significance of Ring A's positive charge in identifying binding pockets. Additionally, we suggest exploring alternative feature selection methods such as SHAP or Markov trees. These could potentially capture more nuanced, nonlinear interactions that might be missed by a linear selection method like LASSO. Minor Revisions: In the introduction, we suggest that the authors clarify the importance of preventing deep hydrophobic binding pockets in a pharmaceutical context, including a more streamlined discussion of coumarin derivatives and their therapeutic potential for SARS-CoV-2. We suggest in Fig. 2D that the graphs’ y-axes should be scaled the same and these curves should be labeled “GA-rich” and “G” for clarity. For Fig. 3A, we suggest the legend be enhanced and a scale bar added for clarity. For Fig 3D, it is difficult to identify the yellow, grey, and orange dashed lines.

Below are a few comments: - I don't understand figure S1A. The TAD for VP16 is shown as 304-382. I assume this is a mistake as it is 410-490. - For the Med7-HA-SNAP549 construction, I assume controls have been made such as the ability to be correctly integrated into the Mediator complex. It would be nice to show this. - All the experiments were carried out using nuclear extracts and therefore potentially ‘contaminants’ (such as transcription factors interacting with the Mediator and competing with Gal4-VP16) which could interfere with recruitment. Did the authors attempt to directly purify the Mediator and/or Pol II in their system? - The multiple bridging model at the end is interesting. But if I've understood correctly, it can only work if 2 or more activator molecules interact simultaneously with the same Mediator complex. This model is possible if the activator targets different Mediator subunits. This is the case for VP16 in yeast (Med15 and Med17). But how does the model apply to an activator that targets a single subunit? Did the authors try another activator? A Gal4DBD-Gcn4 TAD for example? - -VP16 is also known to interact with TBP, TFIIB and p62 TFIIH.

I have a specific concern regarding figure 6. If I understand correctly, you make the assumption that the frequency of Ki67 positive cells directly correlates with proliferation speed. I find this assumption problematic, Ki67 protein accumulates in S-G2M and is degraded in G0/G1 (see for instance PMID: 30067968).  One can find that, at steady growth, a shortening of SG2M will actually reduce the proportion of Ki67+ cells, (a shortening of G1 will however increase it), depending on these parameters, the growth rate of the population could be significantly larger for big clones with no change to the proportion of Ki67+ cells. With the Fucci markers combined with ki67 you might be able to resolve this question, but I can imagine it would be very difficult to also identify different clones in this case.

I do hope that a substantially revised version of this paper would eventually be published—in an internationally renowned journal. The authors have done a great job and deserve such a form of recognition. Still, the paper also suffers from several shortcomings that have less to do with its 'pre-print' status than with its theoretical and methodological foundations. The following is a brief exposition of its weaknesses, as I see them. The paper is beset with inconsistencies. To begin with, the contrast between 'ERC science' and 'Consortia science' is a non-starter. Not only do some ERC grants require grantees to set up international consortia (i.e., Synergy Grants), but, also, 'Consortia science' in this context aims to group together types of EU-awarded grants that are internally diverse, including Research and Innovation Actions (that make provision for fundamental research) and Innovation Actions (that do not). 'Consortia science', put it simply, do not exist—not even as an analytical category. Along these lines, at some point in the 'Introduction' section, the paper hints at an important aspect of grant funding: the constant need to look for new funding, or 'strategic anticipation'. This has to do neither with 'consortia science' nor with 'ERC science', because, in both cases, recipients are expected and must search for funding once the project is finished. Unfortunately, this rather important aspect of grant funding (or project-based funding) is nowhere considered in the presentation and discussion of results. Pursuing this line of research further would be rather illuminating and would help us disclose the real problems connected to grant funding (a topic that Merimans is concerned with in another paper, already published). Also critical, by this commentator's point of view, is the assimilation of 'international collaboration' to 'knowledge co-creation' and 'knowledge co-production'. This usage is clearly confusing and misguiding. 'Co-production' has a very specific meaning in Science and Technology Studies, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with getting industry involved in the project. Furthermore, the reality of RIAs and IAs do not stand to the implied meaning of such moniker. Most of the time, such involvement truly amounts to a division of labour, according to which the companies in question act as 'demonstration cases' that implement and test (or demonstrate) the technology being proposed. Nowhere can one find an instance of 'co-production'. I am pretty sure that the authors know a great deal about grant funding, and about EC's Framework Programmes in particular. Yet, the previous critical remarks are a glaring illustration that additional research is needed to get fully acquainted with the subtleties of such funding scheme—knowledge necessary to fully understand what is at stake in the interviews. To conclude with this informal review, two methodological remarks: 1) it is by no means clear which the selection of participants have been. I believe that only a minority of them have experience in ERC grants (either applying for them or, crucially, gaining them), so that framing the whole paper in terms of 'how well ERC grants are' might be, once again, distorting and misleading; 2) nowhere are details about the coding process being offered. As the research work, despite the pre-print format of the paper, seems to have concluded, this is not an absence that can be attributed to the preliminary stage at which the results have been published. Hoping that these indications help the authors improve the manuscript.

In the field of blood substitutes, the Hb content is an important factor in NP synthesis, since the majority of the particle’s weight should consist of Hb to be able to deliver somewhat sufficient oxygen. (in RBCs, Hb is 96% of its dry weight). Could the authors also calculate and add the Hb content within the NP weight (the weight% Hb)? Going off the information given in Section 4.3: ‘Hemoglobin is passively encapsulated by combining the desired concentration of hemoglobin with silk solution prior to combining with PVA.’ Does that mean 250 µg/mL Hb was added into a 5% w/v silk solution (0.25 mg/mL / 50 mg/mL = 0.005 = 0.5 %). With Silk:PVA = 1:4, thus a 4x dilution (=1.25%).  Thus, the Hb content is either 1.25% (for 250 Hb formulations) or 0.625% (for 125 Hb formulations)? Whatever the Hb content is, it will give valuable information in their potential, and worth reporting in the manuscript. - UV-Vis Spectroscopy. The authors determine the mHb% using the cyanmethemoglobin method, which is based on the UV-Vis spectra of Hb. Would it be possible to add the full UV-Vis spectra of the tested formulation in the SI? Often, NPs create an absorbance signal itself, so it would be nice to see how this affects the measurements, if at all. - In vitro studies. Section 4.10: ‘The wells stimulated with silk nanoparticles received 250 μl of M0 media supplemented with 50 μg of silk particles.’ How did this concentration come about? Would it be possible to add a prior cell viability assay that determined the optimal particle concentration to use, or even show a IC50?",2024-12-12T11:32:12,,eggersii,10.1101/2023.03.01.530637,Silk Fibroin Particles as Carriers in the Development of All-Natural Hemoglobin-Based Oxygen Carriers (HBOCs),"Marisa O Pacheco, Henry M Lutz, Jostin Armada, Nickolas Davies, Isabelle K Gerzenshtein, Alaura S Cakley, Bruce D Spiess, Whitney L Stoppel",2023-03-02

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.25.620249v1#comment-6607526920,biorxivstage,2,"Science Discussion The multiple modern, peer reviewed papers on the field status of Ivory-billed Woodpecker (IBWO) are dominated by visual media depicting putative or actual  Ivory-billed Woodpeckers. The most important and impactful data sets determining that the species is extant is the collection of thousands of video and picture frames taken by discreet researchers with various cameras. Since there is only one other large woodpecker in the USA, which is not a congeneric, using visual evidence is effective as the two species are quite different in plumage, movements, and behavior. Visual evidence of putative or actual IBWOs shows that the subjects are clearly not Pileateds when plumage, movements and behavior are examined. Elevating the veracity of acoustical evidence firmly indicating IBWO presence, as this paper concludes, is problematic since there are several known and hypothetical avian and other vertebrate sources of kent calls. A major, glaring omission is that the putative IBWO kent data set is only compared to one Blue Jay kent when it is well known that several species of vertebrates, including birds, amphibians and mammals, are accepted as producing Ivory-billed-like kent sounds.  Even if the author establishes or approaches establishing that the putative IBWO kents are not blue jays, which is not accomplished, he has not addressed any other competing species. Note that the 2024 peer reviewed paper ""Echo of extinction: The Ivory-billed Woodpecker's tragic legacy and its impact on scientific integrity"", P. Michalak employs a much more sophisticated spectrogram analysis than the prepaper and found the putative IBWO kents from LA  did not match with known IBWO kents. (Bio Science, Volume 74, Issue 11, November 2024, Pages 740–746, https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biae072 Compounding the impediments to a firm acoustical ID, the only widely accepted kents of IBWOs recorded were of agitated birds (n =2), 90  years ago from the Singer Tract, LA.  Alerted or stressed individual birds can have frequencies different than nominal productions of the same song or call type. This prepaper fails to even acknowledge these major and other issues yet somehow has very strong  conclusions that are therefore unsupported, metaphysical and proselytizing in nature rather than scientifically anchored. One well known competing source of IBWO-like kents is the Blue Jay (BLJA). For decades it has been understood that some spectrograms of Blue Jay kents have shown differences with Singer Tract, LA, Ivory-billed kents. At a minimum any research paper that attempts to address and dispositively conclude this issue will need careful spectrogram analysis of many examples of these Blue Jay  kents and then compare them to IBWO kents or putative IBWO kents. The biological context of the putative jay kents must be detailed; not ignored. Many would concur with the prepaper author including Choctawhatchee River, FL kents in the set of putative Ivory-billed kents since these were spatiotemporal to hundreds of other IBWO supporting data points in key data sets such as---suggestive videos, IB sightings some by 2 observers, recorded and heard Campephilus-like double knocks near the kents, IB-like roosts holes. etc. I have line surveyed the Choctawhatchee River over 120 hours and found Blue Jays to be non-existent to rare since this river bottom corridor has few oaks. Unfortunately the author's standards for most of the non-Choctawhatchee, FL, alleged IBWO kents in his set is minimal and nebulous. The prepaper has so many biases, omissions, and basic scientific flaws that a rewrite is needed.  A terse comment here however  would not help the conservation of the few Ivory-bills likely left. The following observations and recommendations are offered. The data in this prepaper includes only one Blue Jay kent call spectrogram which was recorded and commented on by many over the decades. The author then inserts an unprecedented, unfounded and unsound comparative method, not found in the ornithological literature. The data includes ~ 136 Blue Jay calls, of which none are kent calls, to claim the establishment of an unabridged frequency capability for all types of Blue Jay calls. The author erroneously takes his incomplete set, in regards to the species extensive repertoire of Blue Jay and any hypothetical spectrograms and concludes that this eliminates all possible frequencies, tonality or partials/harmonics that may be produced when a Blue Jay kents. The author takes the actually abridged set of Hz and illogically and awkwardly states in the Abstract ""Differences are seen such that these two species cannot be mistaken for each other"". In the Conclusion sections he  supports the hyperbole by stating that interspecific physiological differences make it impossible for a BLJA to produce the Hzs he found in the putative IBWO set of kents he examined. ""Because of different morphology and functional anatomy, Blue Jays and Ivory-billed Woodpeckers are going to make different quality sounds."" He continues that all Blue Jay kents cannot be IBWO kents and the reverse but the scientific premise he employs is  unprecedented in ornithological research. The text or bibliography does not include one reference that uses body length as a driver or predictor of avian Hz range capabilities. During an on-line comment exchange with the author pivotal parts of his concept are formed by the idea that a larger bird cannot possibly be matched by smaller birds as far as Hz convergence. In this case the birds are of relatively similar size of 20 inches and 12 inches. There is no Ostrich to Hummingbird length disparity involved here. The author may have no field experience with any members of the genus genus Procnias (bellbirds) with a 125 decibel level with a body length of 11 inches.  Volume or Hz range may have little to no correlation with body size. I have searched the literature unsuccessful to discover what the author is possibly using as a prerequisite to his sweeping Bergmann's rule-like conclusions that correlate acoustical Hz and moderate changes in avian body size. This is an example of common sense bias that a 20 inch bird cannot produce at least some of the same Hz as a 12 inch bird. These biases and assertions seem unsupported and unlikely hypotheses let alone conclusions by the author. The author is responsible for doing a literature search, not readers, before prepapers are posted; the text and bibliography portray minimal research was done to support the presented hyperbolic declarations. Most publication submittals are rejected because the literature search was poor. This prepaper's bibliography verifies that not even one adequate reference let alone comprehensive work on Blue jay ecology, mimicry, relative high intelligence, syrinx, physiology, vocalizations, point surveys for Blue Jays in the alleged IBWO kent areas, etc. was read or done . Blue Jay' hypothetical acoustical capabilities have as a pretext a species possessing a syrinx with broad capabilities, high avian intelligence, wide repertoire, strong memory and substantial mimicry ability.  Years ago I checked the literature on the subject species and at these rather mid value frequencies and harmonics there is no physiologically based reason that IBWO kents and Blue Jay kents must always be at different Hzs. In addition  the literature does generalize that there is often sexual intraspecific differences in a species Hz for the same general call, such as a kent.  Extrapolating from known ornithological literature, no one knows how a male blue jay would mimic a modern female IBWO it ambiently heard kenting; how a female blue jay would imitate a male IBWO, etc.  It is not known how a blue jay would mimic a nuthatches kent vs an IBWO it heard kenting. A major, glaring omission is that the putative IBWO kent data set is only compared to one Blue Jay kent when it is well known that several species of vertebrates, including birds, amphibians and mammals, are known to produce IBWO-like kent sounds. Brief info on Hz Within a single bird species, different calls can have varying frequencies. This variation can depend on several factors: 1.            Type of Call: Different calls serve different purposes (e.g., alarm calls, mating calls, contact calls) and can have distinct frequency ranges. 2.            Individual Variation: Just like humans have unique voices, individual birds may produce calls with slightly different frequencies due to physiological differences. 3.            Context and Situation: The context in which a call is made can influence its frequency. For example, a bird may alter its call if it's trying to signal alarm in a crowded area versus calling to a mate. 4.            Environmental Factors: The surrounding environment can affect how calls are produced and perceived. For instance, birds may adjust their calls in dense forests versus open areas. The Abstract is ambiguous and misleading; also inconsistent with the rest of the paper. The Abstract does not mention many of the strong conclusions and constructs that accumulate as the paper proceeds. The constructs and conclusions, if true, would be quite compelling,  with scientific value; the issue of distinguishing recorded Ivory-billed Woodpecker kent calls from other species kent calls is a complex issue. Unfortunately this paper ineffectively addresses the issue with a short,  terse incomplete Abstract that is subsequently followed by unsubstantiated and unsupported conclusions and erroneous, sweeping ornithological assertions. Ambiguity---the paper’s central theme is initially thought to be that IBWO kents can be distinguished from Blue Jay kents. The short Abstract mentions ~ 136 Blue Jay calls have been examined; after quite a bit of reading one finds out that only one of the ~136 Blue Jays calls examined is a jay kent call ( Blue jay calls, n = 137, Blue jay kent call n = 1).  At this point some readers will realize the omission in the Abstract is an intended pathway to one of the papers eventual conclusions that Blue Jays are physiologically incapable of producing the Hz found in the putative IBWO putative kent call spectrograms. Misleading---the Title and Abstract concentrate on Blue Jay kents; the latter highlighting  n’s of 136 and n = 200, but these numbers are for data sets that do not include any Blue Jay kents. Actual Blue Jay kents spectrograms examined closely by this paper is  n = 1. Inconsistent --- The Abstract is overstated yet some of the subsequent constructs and conclusions are bold and somewhat hyperbolic. Conclusions presented are unsupported and are more correctly described as hypothesizes or unsupported hypothesizes. The paper has n = > 200 for putative IBWO kent calls but fails to call them putative. This omission leads to concerns of circular logic. The paper  provides no supporting evidence that some of these putative IBWO  kent calls were derived from birds that were field IDed as IBWOs or for some reason likely IBWOs. Acceptable reasons could be that the subject kent call were associated with a tempospatially IBWO sighting or double knocks. Field details are needed for all  kents that were not from Choctawhatchee River, FL. Kents in that study were spatiotemporal to hundreds of others IBWO supporting data points in data sets. It is possible that a hypothesis that all IBWO and BLJA kents can be differentiated by spectrograms is correct. I propose it as a hypothesis. However jumping to premature conclusions with so much missing is not the way to proceed. We have delayed the erroneous extinction proposal with solid field techniques that had little if anything to do with Blue Jays and exaggerations but did truthfully present the videos, game cams, sighting notes, etc. IBWO conservation will not be prodded by examining characteristics such as acoustical Hz with flawed methods. Some will rightfully suspect that these odd assertions are designed to proselytize rather than establish the truth.",2024-12-09T01:41:58,avtrader,avtrader,10.1101/2024.10.25.620249,Ivory-billed Woodpecker and Blue Jay kent comparisons at spectrogram level reveal differences,John D Williams,2024-10-25

They do not reflect the opinions of each individual journal club participant. Any responses to these points should be addressed to Malte Elson. In their preprint, Spiess et al. (2024) illustrate the impact of influential data points on statistical significance in linear regression analyses. The authors reanalyzed data from three high-impact journals by searching for the term ""linear regression” and digitizing graphs of the included papers (due to the absence of raw data). Their findings revealed that excluding influential data points often rendered previously significant results non-significant. The simulations included in the study largely confirmed expected outcomes, supporting the overall argument for incorporating leave-one-out analyses in data analyses practices. The authors ultimately advocate for broader adoption of such methods to enhance the robustness of statistical conclusions. We found the paper to be interesting and an illustrative contribution to statistical education, both in terms of the potential fragility of published claims and as an illustration of an intuitive but underused outlier detection method. We identified points that might allow the authors to strengthen future versions of the manuscript, including some critical points about potential weaknesses or absences in the current version of the manuscript. 1) TERMINOLOGY CONFUSION AND REPORTING ISSUES * Graphs vs. Papers: There is some confusion regarding the unit of analyses, and probably some reporting errors: On p. 4, l. 115, the paper states that the sample was 24 + 30 + 46 = 100 graphs, whereas on p. 6, l. 170 the authors state they examined 100 publications (going by Table 1, this is a simple clerical error, and should say graphs). * Similarly, the description of the columns in Table 1 (p. 11) is confusing, and we think has at least one reporting error: * It is unclear what “Hits” represent: Are these unique papers, or do the search engines of Science/Nature/PNAS return the same paper multiple times for each  instance of the search term (“linear regression”)? * What does ""number of graphs that were not shown"" mean? We think these are instances of linear regressions that simply were not reported with a corresponding graph in the original publication, but they could also be graphs missing, inaccessible, or excluded * The “Articles” column is described as “number of Articles in which the analyzable graphs were found” (p. 11, l. 314), but we think these are the 21 articles in which the 29 “influential variables” were found. The number of articles with analyzable graphs is not reported. It thus remains unclear how many papers were included, and how many graphs were analyzed from each paper. * On p. 6, the authors report having identified 29 graphs in 21 papers in which the removal of one datapoint changes the result of a linear regression (see also Figure 1). On p. 6, l. 179 the “incidence” (should be prevalence instead) of changes in papers is reported as ~20%. However, this puts papers (21) in the numerator and graphs in the denominator (100), which underestimates the prevalence. On the graph-level, it should be 29/100 = 29%. The paper-level prevalence cannot be calculated because the authors do not report the number of papers with analyzable graphs (see above). * We strongly recommend reporting a Prisma flowchart to clarify the inclusion/exclusion of graphs and papers. In the same vein, the paper lacks basic information about the included studies, such as sample sizes or the distribution of p-values. Other information would also help emphasizing the importance of the present study, e.g. citation metrics. * The authors refer to “Supplementary Data 1” (p. 4, l. 121) but provide no link. 2) SAMPLING STRATEGY * The study focuses on digitizable graphs without overlapping data points, inherently excluding studies with (1) larger samples and (2) homogeneous effects, where overlapping data points should be more frequent. This selection skews the included papers towards studies with smaller samples and p-values near 0.05 (due to lower power and publication bias / p-hacking), which are more susceptible to the illustrated effects. This is not a problem per se, but means the findings (including the prevalence rate) are about a narrower population of studies. Either way, the selection effects should be discussed in the paper. * It is not fully clear how it was decided which graphs are analyzable and which are not. Moreover, on p. 4, l. 127-130 the authors state that the obtained regression parameters match those reported in the paper closely, but they do not further explain what exactly this means, or what happened when they did not match 3) ANALYSES AND CONCLUSIONS * The analysis does not account for dependencies when multiple graphs from the same paper, which will likely be based on the same data (which are then susceptible to the exclusion effects), are included. * In a way, the susceptibility of findings to the removal of a single data point is a restatement of issues related to small samples. Small samples are inherently more fragile, and larger sample sizes are more robust to the influence of removing (or adding) single data points and render p-values (and other estimates) more stable. This is not to say that the findings reported are not interesting; however, we were wondering whether a table of all included studies sorted by observed p-value and sample size would have flagged the same fragile papers. This is also not to say that dfstat is redundant, and we absolutely see the pedagogical value in being able to point at individual data points that “cause” a finding to be significant. Rather, we would be interested to what extent dfstat converges with common heuristics. * Relatedly, the authors decry that influence measures such as dfstat are largely ignored, even by statisticians (p. 4, l. 139). This may well be, but of course, statisticians (and non-statisticians) are obviously aware of issues related to low power and small samples, and one of these issues is the problem of spurious findings (e.g. due to few, extreme data points). * The authors largely blame frequentist statistics, particularly on p. 10, where e.g. they state that “[a]s long as stating significance or not is still based on the ubiquitous α = 0.05 threshold, these statements can be sensitive to the presence of a single data point.” (l. 282-284). However, it is unclear how this follows from their findings. Any inference (not just α = 0.05) could be susceptible to the influence of single data points when the estimate is close to the criterion. Moreover, particularly when the sample size is low, any metric’s value (e.g. point estimates) will vary as a function of the removal of individual data points, regardless of whether the inference is threshold-based or not. This is simply a property of statistical models fit to a limited amount of data. So again, the issue seems to be with small sample sizes. 4) RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Things we would have liked to see: * Additional analyses, such as leave-two-out or leave-k-out methods. The leave-one-out analyses are providing a good intuition of how fragile some small-sample study results are. Additional leave-k-out analyses would provide further information about the fragility of the entire sample. * So far, the authors are concerned with the fragility of results as an outcome of removing data points. An additional study exploring the reverse scenario would be valuable. Specifically, it could investigate how extreme an additional data point would need to be to alter results, and how adding non-extreme data points could mitigate the relative weight of extreme data points. * Discussing dfstat as a robustness metric (“How many individual data points would have to be removed/added to render a significant result nonsignificant or vice versa”) * A discussion of how dfstat could be used for p-hacking by showing researchers which data points they would have to remove to turn a nonsignificant study result into a significant one. * The authors graciously and immediately shared data and code with one of us who requested it, and we thank them for this. We would like to see this data and code provided in a public repository and linked to in a future version of the manuscript. * We note that the authors chose to anonymise their data so that the reader cannot tell which original study’s results are robust or not. Personally, we think that meta-scientific interests are best served by making this information public; that is, we would like this data to not merely be used to illustrate the method but also inform the reader about the fragility or robustness of those publications’ results. Of course, not everyone agrees with this practice - perhaps the authors could comment on their perspective on this issue in a future version of the manuscript.",2024-12-06T17:54:14,,Malte Elson ,10.1101/2024.10.30.621016,Scientific reasoning driven by influential data: resuscitate dfstat!,"Andrej-Nikolai Spiess, Stefan Rödiger, Matthias Schaks, Michał Burdukiewicz, Joel Tellinghuisen",2024-10-30

Their lead compound effectively reduces the putative pathological substance, VLCFAs, in the CNS. There are a few points to address in this paper that could significantly improve an otherwise strong piece of work. In figure 2 Huang et al report C26:0/C22:0 levels. These probably slightly underestimate the potency of their compound, as ELOVL1 inhibition reduces not only C26:0, but also C22:0, the denominator. Through most of the paper, they report absolute concentrations, so this is a minor concern. Huang et al incorrectly report that our studies (Come et al, 2021) ""measured only Lysophosphotidylcholine C26:0 levels"", and were thus less complete. We report reductions in C26:0 LPCs, acyl carnitines and total VLCFAs in the CNS in our paper. Huang et al report that ""treatment with the ELOVL1 inhibitor unexpectedly led to profound transcriptional changes beyond correction of pathways altered by the loss of ABCD1."" Almost all small molecule drugs have off target activities and clinically apparent side effects that are accompanied by transcriptional changes. The most parsimonious explanation for the ""off target"" transcriptional changes is ""off target"" activity of the compound. If they were to test multiple structurally distinct ELOVL1 inhibitors and find a shared pattern across scaffolds, that could support the argument that this is somehow a general property of small molecule ELOVL1 inhibition. The conclusion to their abstract that ""ELOVL1 inhibition may have broader consequences . . . than the correction of lipid homeostasis"" goes beyond the data they have in hand. In the face of a disease that is fatal in one third of boys who carry mutations, such changes in transcriptional profiles, without any associated findings in traditional in vivo toxicology studies, should not be a reason to discontinue development.

Here are two examples: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NZ_BMOE01000030.1?report=fasta https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NZ_WWEN01000019.1?report=fasta Both of these are small contigs, and therefore may not actually be part of a contiguous bacteria genome. When we BLAST them with BLASTN, they match very closely known synthetic vectors for working with HIV. Therefore, in these two cases (and all others I've spot checked, although I have not been comprehensive), there is no evidence that these genes are present in the bacterial genome. Rather, these are evidently cases where someone was sequencing an HIV-related sample on the same lane as a bacterial genome, and cross-contamination occurred (either index hopping or well to well). The HIV-vector sequence was then assembled as part of the bacterial genome, and missed in contamination screening (both by the authors and by NCBI!). Thus I was not able to identify any cases of genomic evidence for the claims of the authors, although I did not look at every hit because the pattern above quickly emerged. If the authors of this work want to provide sufficient evidence for the claim that there are close homologs of HIV related proteins in bacterial genomes, I would suggest taking a close manual inspection of all hits in their table. They should be able to show that these hits are integrated into bacterial chromosomes, and not always on separate contigs. They should show the raw reads then support those integrations. If the claim is that ""some bacteria can acquire HIV-1 genetic material"", they should then also do a comparison at the nucleotide level, not at the translated amino acid level. Finally, if that claim was tree, they should construct a phylogenetic tree to identify the nearest HIV relative and estimate time since divergence. However, it is simply dubious that this is biologically true, because it would be an extraordinary claim if true, with no evidence yet emerged. It is essential to always closely inspect genomic results.

This strategy involves overexpressing ribonucleotide reductase in hPSC-CMs, enhancing their dATP production. Key outcomes include increased left ventricular function, greater exercise capacity, improved cardiac metabolism, and reduced symptoms of heart failure in animal models. The approach combines remuscularization with enhanced contractility, offering a novel therapeutic direction for chronic heart failure. Major Revisions 1. Validation of Claims: - Doubts: The study's claims about the efficacy of dATP-producing CMs in treating chronic heart failure need stronger validation in larger and diverse animal models and human studies. - Critique: The majority of the experimental data involve rodent models. Larger animal studies and eventual human trials are crucial for assessing translative potential and variability in responses (e.g., differences in metabolism and immune reactions). - Example: ""Our goal was to improve regenerative strategies by genome-editing hPSC to make dATP-donor cells… Our results indicate that dATP donor CMs can… persistently improve the function of the chronically injured heart"". 2. Mechanisms of dATP Delivery: - Clarification: Detailed mechanisms on how dATP is transported through gap junctions from donor to host cardiomyocytes require further elucidation and quantification. - Critique: While the study mentions gap junction-mediated dATP transfer, the precise dynamic and extent of this transfer across intercellular connections in vivo are not fully described. - Example: ""In vivo, dATP-producing CMs formed new myocardium that transferred dATP to host cardiomyocytes via gap junctions, increasing their dATP levels"". 3. Long-Term Safety and Efficacy: - Skepticism: Long-term safety data and potential adverse effects of continuous dATP elevation, such as risks of arrhythmogenicity, were not adequately addressed. - Critique: Although the study indicates beneficial dATP effects, continuous high levels of dATP need further investigation to rule out chronic side effects including arrhythmias or maladaptive cardiac remodeling. - Example: Concerns: ""Interventions to increase the contractility of the failing heart have been sought for decades…our novel strategy of cell therapy…"". Minor Revisions 1. Typos and Errors: - There are a few minor typographical errors and ambiguities in phrasing that can be corrected for better readability. 2. Figures and Diagrams Consistency: - The figures and diagrams should uniformly represent the data and should be referenced consistently within the text (e.g., Fig 6 referenced properly with aligned legends and labels). 3. Formatting and Style: - Standardize font sizes and alignments, particularly in figures and tables. Ensure that equation formatting, subscripts, and superscripts are consistently applied. Recommendations 1. Include Larger Animal Studies: - Conduct larger and more diverse animal studies to establish translational efficacy and safety across different species. This would bridge the existing gap between rodent models and potential human applications. 2. Detailed Mechanistic Studies: - Expand mechanistic studies on the biophysics of dATP transfer and integration into host cells, detailing the kinetics of dATP movement and concentration gradients across different heart zones. 3. Extended Safety Profiles: - Investigate long-term safety profiles of dATP elevation in vivo, focusing on electrical stability of myocardial tissues and potential non-target effects on other tissues/organs跨链接。 4. Human Trials: - Initiate phase I clinical trials after thorough preclinical validations to evaluate safety, dosage, efficacy, and delivery mechanisms in human heart failure patients. 5. Data Sharing and Reproducibility: - Provide access to raw data and methodological details to enhance reproducibility and allow independent verification of results. In conclusion, the preprint presents a promising approach to treating chronic heart failure using genetically engineered hPSC-CMs. Nonetheless, further work on validation, safety, and translational studies is essential to move toward clinical applications.",2024-12-06T01:19:33,xpeerd,xPeer,10.1101/2023.04.24.538108,Cell based dATP delivery as a therapy for chronic heart failure,"Ketaki N Mhatre, Julie Mathieu, Amy Martinson, Galina Flint, Leslie P.

However, the mechanism by which ATR regulates mTORC1 activity remains poorly understood. To address these knowledge gaps, the authors of the Tangudu et al. manuscript investigated the role of ATR  in activating mTORC1 in both unperturbed and p16 knockdown cell models. The findings of this study unveiled several key novelties including the role of ATR in modulating mTORC1 activity via de novo cholesterol synthesis under both low p16 expression and basal conditions. Additionally, lanosterol synthase (LSS), an enzyme that regulates the biosynthesis of cholesterol, is regulated by ATR, and ATR's regulation of mTORC1 is independent of the Checkpoint Kinase 1 (CHK1) and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) pathways. Several innovative experimental techniques were employed within the course of the study, including the simultaneous proteomic and transcriptomic profiling used to identify transcriptional and post-translational changes in ATR signaling and the use of phospho-specific antibodies to monitor the effects of ATR modulation on mTORC1 activation at specific time points. However, we have identified one major concern that we believe should be addressed prior to the publication of the paper. The major concern that was found in the paper was that the mechanism of action for the ATR-mTORC1 pathway was not fully represented in all the broad ranges of cells in the data shown in the figures. The issue is that while in Figure 1 the expression of ATR and mTORC1 was shown through a broad range of cell lines, the latter portion of the paper focused primarily on SKMEL28 cells, a melanoma cell line, which does not fully represent the broad spectrum of the cellular model that the ATR-mTORC1 pathway has a role in general cell metabolism and proliferation. An experiment that could be done to address this major issue of underrepresentation of the ATR-mTORC1 expression in unperturbed cells, as well as diseased cells, is to repeat the experiments done from Figure 2 to Figure 4 in all cells that were used in Figure 1 (HeLa, HEK293, MEFs). There are also some minor concerns we identified with the manuscript. One small issue is the lack of quantification or statistical analysis included in Figure 1. This would allow for a better understanding of the content of the figure. Another minor concern is the coloration of the fluorescence images in Figure 4. The chosen colors make it difficult to make out the overlaps in the merged images, especially in Figure 4B. This could be fixed by changing the colors to ones that are more distinct when merged. The final minor concern identified is the absence of GTPase Rheb in the working model. GTPase Rheb is included in the introduction as it plays a role in the activation of mTORC1 after localization to the lysosome. While the paper is focused on the localization of mTORC1, its activation by GTPase Rheb may also be affected by this mechanism.",2024-12-05T23:03:05,dinasarsam,Dina Sarsam,10.1101/2023.10.27.564195,ATR promotes mTORC1 activity via de novo cholesterol synthesis,"Naveen Kumar Tangudu, Alexandra N.

This manuscript, authored by Aird et al., demonstrates that in both p16 knockdown cells and unperturbed cells, ATR increases lanosterol synthesis through de novo cholesterol synthesis, which promotes mTORC1 activity by lysosomal localization. They determined that this pathway consists of ATR, not ATM, and is independent of the CHK2 and TSC2 processes. The paper contains several major concerns, detailed below, that must be addressed before the data can be properly evaluated. Until these concerns are resolved the findings within the paper are unable to be thoroughly assessed, delaying our understanding of how ATR influences mTORC1 during DDR. The first major concern identified within the paper is the lack of orthogonal validation, specifically for Figure 4 A & B. This is a concern because, in order to validate the findings, different methods should be applied to confirm reliability, reproducibility and robustness. In Figure 4 A & B we are specifically relying on the visual trends to make a conclusion, which could be misinterpreted. The authors should perform Radiolabeled Cholesterol Uptake Assays which measure cell cholesterol absorbance by labeling cholesterol compounds with radioactive isotopes which would contribute to their orthogonal validation and help support their results. The second major concern is that phosphorylation of S6K is not limited to mTORC1. This is a major concern because S6K is a direct substrate for other kinases, such as JNK1 and PKC. Multiple validations are required to show that mTORC1 activity leads to the decrease in phosphorylation of S6K. One validation that can be conducted is to overexpress ATR to observe if phosphorylation of S6K increases, which would further support the direct link between mTORC1 activity and S6K phosphorylation. An additional validation is to conduct an in vitro kinase assay with mTORC1 and S6K to eliminate the possibility of confounding variables. The third major concern is that p16 expression can vary significantly between cell types. This is a major concern because HeLa cells have high levels of p16 expression, HEK293 cells have low levels of p16 expression unless under stress and MEFs have significantly higher levels of p16 as cells approach senescence. Quantifying the basal levels of p16 in each type of cell line is crucial since the focus is on ATR’s effect under basal conditions. This can be done by quantifying the levels of p16 through western blotting and testing if ATR affects mTORC1 similarly across varying expression levels. The first minor concern is that the quantification of the western blots is needed throughout the paper in order to substantially improve the clarity of the figures. The second minor concern would be to provide justification about the selection of the specific cell lines which would provide clarity on the major concerns related to varying p16 expression. The third minor concern is that the verbiage of mTORC1 should be consistent throughout the whole paper to increase readability and reduce confusion. The final minor concern is that Figure 3’s title is unclear; replacing “decreases” with “knockdown” would be more effective.",2024-12-05T22:37:23,cecyliaolivo,Cecylia Olivo,10.1101/2023.10.27.564195,ATR promotes mTORC1 activity via de novo cholesterol synthesis,"Naveen Kumar Tangudu, Alexandra N.

The manuscript by Ellis et al. investigates an alternative approach to systematically quantify transcription rate and mRNA stability using RATE-seq and SLAM-seq to further validate the relevance of miRNA loads among induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), neural progenitors (NPC), and neurons (Neu). This approach expands on the role of mRNA stability in shaping transcriptional buffering and driving 3’UTR lengthening via miRNA load. The paper suggests a comprehensive approach towards understanding the regulation of mRNA stability and transcription rates during human neurodevelopment. The use of RATE-seq as a technique for measuring half-life and transcription rates was a powerful and novel approach to dive deeper into the current understanding of this field, and could be applicable to future studies.   The authors also explore the idea of a mechanistic link between miRNA regulation and transcriptome changes. The reproducibility of results between cell types was reinforced that accumulation of miRNAs during neurodevelopment potentially leads to preferential degradation of short 3' UTR-containing mRNAs in neurons. The manuscript outlined the following findings about neuronal differentiating cells: i) mRNA stability and transcription rate play an equal role in establishing steady-state levels of the transcriptome, ii) buffering genes controlled by pluripotency transcription factors are regulated by mRNA stability, iii) increased miRNA load corresponds to mRNA degradation of most genes in neurons, and iv) preferential degradation of neuronal short 3’ UTR-containing mRNAs resulting in decreased RNA stability. These are not novel findings to the scientific community but the reproduction of previous research is not without merit. Reproducibility is a hallmark of quality scientific discovery.  However the novelty of this research is demonstrated in the unique sequencing protocols and statistical techniques utilized. Despite this achievement the paper doesn’t sufficiently expand the literature in such a way that qualifies it for publication. Given the issues outlined below, the manuscript must address the following concerns prior to acceptance for publication. One of the most pressing major concerns is the lack of a discernable attempt to close the gap in knowledge regarding the relationship between mRNA stability and transcriptional regulation during neurodevelopment. Specifically, the manuscript demonstrates the shifts in mRNA stability and 3’UTR lengthening. These results have already been documented in previous literature thus leaving unclear how this research advances the field and our understanding beyond known mechanisms. The question of whether miRNA load is sufficient or necessary to drive 3’UTR lengthening should be addressed in any future iterations of this paper. The authors could address this concern by designing an experiment to validate the causal relationship between increasing miRNA load and 3’ UTR lengthening. This can be achieved experimentally by overexpressing miRNA in human cell lines and tracking subsequent increases or decreases in 3’UTR lengthening. A second major concern that should ideally be remedied by the authors is the use of a single experimental cell line. To strengthen the quality of the research performed in this manuscript experiments should be orthogonally validated in other human cell lines. Justification of each cell line used should be explicitly mentioned in the manuscript. Additional tissue types can also be explored experimentally to strengthen the mechanistic link. The minor concern that needs to be addressed by the authors of Ellis et al. is the addition of a justification of the time points used during data collection. This context will allow readers more insight into the overall logic of the experiment. It is generally understood that the chosen time points are typical when working with neural cells but this logic may not be clear to an individual not actively involved in the field.",2024-12-05T03:18:42,,Arianna,10.1101/2023.03.01.530249,Transcriptional buffering and 3ʹUTR lengthening are shaped during human neurodevelopment by shifts in mRNA stability and microRNA load,"Marat Mufteev, Deivid C.
