I enjoyed reading your paper and found it very informative. One comment I had was regarding line 255 of the manuscript where you assess kinase activity of the recombinant T474I and L528W mutants by monitoring Y551 phosphorylation; my understanding was that this site is typically phosphorylated by upstream kinases and that Y223 is an autophosphorylation site and therefore a better measure of kinase activity. I suppose since it was an in vitro assay it was not confounded by the presence of other kinases but I wonder if the Y223 would have shown discordant activity with Y551, particularly for the T474I mutant.

We think keeping target and decoy proteins as joined entities is an important aspect of sound error estimation in crosslinking MS. Consequently, our open-source software for error estimation, xiFDR is doing this since version 1.0 (openly released on GitHub Sep 9, 2016, https://github.com/Rappsilb.... It is great to see that your lab is also now coming to this conclusion. There are a few details regarding the implementation that make a difference, but that are not clear to us from reading your manuscript. You do not mention how you report protein-protein interactions in the fused approach. Additionally, the level of crosslinks (CSM, peptides, residues) is not specified. Crucially, although the manuscript demonstrates a clear effect, it lacks a mechanistic explanation for the observed outcomes - both the lack of decoys in the non-fused and the recovery of decoys in the fused case. Further questions include: How are N-terminal errors accounted for? Why did you change your previous FDR formula to the one employed by us and others (and will you revise previous work accordingly...)? Finally, you are not comparing your results to those obtained by FDR boosting. This would be valuable, as FDR boosting can offset at least the gains attributed to context-sensitive subgrouping by the (corrected version of) mi-filter.

They use this pipeline to segment single cells and extract both single-cell and 3D-based features. The authors also pursue three application experiments, in which they expose cells to osmotic stress, topology modifications, and different gravity forces. We read this paper as part of a journal club, and have decided to compile a collective review and publicly share it with the authors. This was inspired by the Arcadia Science Preprint Review Pizza Party Initiative, and this represents our third preprint review. Overall, our review focuses on the need for additional clarity, strengthening methodological justifications, and an increased discussion about potential implications of the findings and techniques used. We provide several specific comments below: - The authors discuss “database architecture” (line 99, and throughout) but they do not provide any additional details on the architecture nor the technology used. Without these details, it is difficult to understand the role and functionality of the database in relation to the pipeline. - The authors describe their pipeline effectively, but they do not disclose any potential limitations or challenges. How user-friendly is the pipeline? Is it reproducible and interpretable? Will the pipeline work with other spheroid or organoid types? - The pipeline tool describes the power of flexibility. Users can enrich the database with additional features of their choice, but what benefit does this flexibility provide? Does having more features improve results? Does the software provide guidance to a user on how to decide these parameters? - The authors discuss that previous tools do not disclose compute time, but then they use a publicly available tool (StarDist) and report compute time. It is unclear how the authors improve compute time independently of these other tools. The authors also do not benchmark the full run time and resource usage of their framework. - The authors extensively discuss quality control, but they do not describe any impact of uneven illumination on the cell images. Do the images suffer from uneven illumination? Would illumination correction improve segmentation and feature extraction? - It appears that the authors are actually using spheroids and not organoids, but the terms are used interchangeably, which could be misleading. - The authors should consider making OrganoProfiler open source to increase community impact, and the authors should properly cite other open source software like VTAE and KNIME. Many other software tools are properly cited, thank you! - In line 546, the authors state: “...realistic simulated 3D image data…” but details on how they created the images and indicators if the simulation worked are lacking. Similarly, because the model was trained on these simulated images, how do the authors understand and trust accuracy metrics? - In line 610 the authors state: “In each image, an expert counted the nuclei that were missing and those with a significant precision issue in their contours, which exceeded 30% of the total nucleus area.” It is unclear why the authors chose precision over other metrics (e.g., IoU). Also, what were the expected error rates of the expert annotator and how might this impact performance interpretation? - We had several comments about clarity and claims that the paper makes in the discussion. The paper states: “Overall, our approach demonstrates a powerful and efficient methodology for imaging, analyzing, and extracting biological information from 3D cellular microsystems.” These are a lot of different focus areas, and it is not clear in which area the tool specifically innovates. Furthermore, the authors state that “large amounts of data can be analyzed with their approach”, but there are no benchmarking or resource usage details. Additionally, the authors state that they have developed a “groundbreaking method” but it is not clear what the authors are doing differently than what is already known/standard practice. Is it the collection of tools in a framework? Lastly, the authors declare no conflict of interests, but it is unclear how QuantaCell might factor in. For example, is QuantaCell a private company selling the software presented here? - We have several specific comments on select figures: Figure 1: The authors segment cytoplasm with Actin, but this may not be the best stain for all cell types. How would a user determine which cytoplasm stain to use if Actin is not a good option or is unavailable? Figure 2d is not mentioned in the text, and there is a typo in the y axis “median z-plan” Figure 3: The authors need to state how many organoids they used for the roundness analysis in Figure 3a - if this shows a single organoid then this approach may not be generalizable. Figure 3b says “2 distinct organoids per condition”, but there are only two curves. Showing one curve per organoid would help determine generalizability. Figure 3c depicts 10 organoids but the authors do not specify how they were selected Figure 4: Could the changes in cellular topology and morphology be due to the changes in oxygen exchange in the molds? Figure 5: Methodological details on measurements would help us understand what was transformed via PCA? Additionally, more details on controls are needed. We also have concerns about extensive user modification of data. We suggest making these modifications transparent and public. Without access to software it will be difficult to determine how the software works given that the data are modified.Without access to software it will be difficult to determine how the software discourages this practice. Also, the authors show only PC1; what is the expected explained variance of PC1? What signals are left in the other components?

You say 'Some Amazonian species have been shown to sing as infrequently as twice in 50 days (Jirinec et al. 2018).' This is not correct- from the second sentence of the paper you cite: ' Tracking was spread over 23 discrete days during July and August 2017...'  The total number of days was 23, not 50.   It is true that the bird only vocalized twice while it was being located, but the paper also notes that it was tracked during daylight hours to determine its space use throughout the day.  In contradiction to the point you are trying to make, Grallaria varia seems to sing quite reliably before dawn (e.g. https://pstoufferbirds.file....

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.05.556422v3#comment-6345731619,biorxivstage,3,"In the previous comment (mtg7x7eXMb) posted on September 29th 2023 [1] to the earlier version of this manuscript (September 8th 2023, [2]), that can be found by clicking on the previous version of the Kim et al preprint https://www.biorxiv.org/con..., it was suggested that when increases in radiotracer uptake (SUV) in a given organ are accompanied by increases in radiotracer concentration in the plasma, it is necessary to adopt mathematical modeling techniques to extract the specific component from the non-specific component of the Time-Activity-Curves (TAC), in order to generate an estimate of the binding potential BP (the latter defined as the product of the ligand affinity (KA) and the molarity of the gp120 receptors in tissues (R0)). The modeling work by Mintun and colleagues in the early 80s shows that increases in probe uptake in the blood without changes in binding potential, leads to increases in SUV in the tissues but not to an increase in the ratio of the SUV in tissues over the SUV in the blood (relative-SUV). In other words, if an increase in SUV in a given organ takes place concomitant to an increase in SUV in the blood without changes in the ratio, the latter points to a fully non-specific component of the increase in SUV uptake in that particular tissue. The reason for my suggestion was because the images of the manuscript [2] clearly showed that increases in probe uptakes in several tissues were concomitant to an increase in blood pool activity uptake (which could be obtained through an ROI placed on the aortic outflow tract, which closely follows the uptake of the Heart,  and that we will call, for simplicity in this document, as Heart SUV or blood-pool-activity BPA SUV), although the BPA SUV levels were not reported in the earlier version. On November 17th, the authors posted a new version of the Kim et al. pre-print [2], in which they have now disclosed in Supplemental Figure S3B and S3C the SUV of the Heart as well as the SUV of other organs normalized on the SUV of the Heart. Other criticisms in the previous September 29th comment [1] were also addressed by the authors who made several changes in their previous 2022 publication Samer et al. [3] (with respect to which, the current pre-print [2] is a follow up study) first on November 8th (by posting new supplementary  files to modify videos, the fourth based on History Versions)) and later on November 22nd through an erratum corrige posted by the JCI-Insight. Through these corrections, the authors agreed that video 5\Figure 3F and video 8 of the previous versions (up to November 8th) of the Samer et al. [3]were incompatible, hence that there is no evidence of increase in probe uptake (post Galunisertib administration) in the Heart of any of the seven imaged animals;  they also realized that the correct scale used to display the images of the 2022 publication was 0-1.0 SUVwb not 0-1.5 SUVwb like stated in the earlier versions (consistent with the content of the earlier September 29th comment [1]).  See more under note z-1. The reason why the scale-correction does not show up in the erratum corrige published on November 22nd on the JCI-Insight website, is because the scale had been originally disclosed only in the legend of the supplemental material files, but not on the Figures or legends or text of the main paper, but  changes in supplemental material are in general allowed without an erratum corrige, the latter being the only editorial tool that can keep track of the changes made in each version. This is a policy followed by some  scientific journals, but its rationale is not clear to me as it seems to go against enhancing transparency in scientific publishing. Indeed, this change from 1.5 down to 1.0 seems relevant, because the new scale highlights a new concern about the images published in the 2022 [3] (which we now know that it displays images with scale 1.0) and the 2023 articles [2] (which displays images with scale 1.5, not 1.0).  The baseline images (images acquired before the first Galunisertib administration) in the 2023 pre-print [2] reveal evidence of higher uptake in the heart compared to the images published in the 2022 paper [3]…the hearts appear more greenish in the 2023 pre-print Figure 2A\S1 Nov 17th version [2] and more blueish in the 2022 paper  Figure 3 [3]. This difference is even more evident after we have now been informed that the SUV scale used to display images of the 2022 publication [3]  is 1.0 and not 1.5.  In other words, the two studies [2, 3], based on the newly corrected SUV scales, are showing clear evidence of differences in half-life of the radiotracer circulating in the plasma of the animals at 24 hr post radiotracer injection (higher Heart uptake (BPA) means longer half-life of the radiotracer). Could biophysical differences of the radiotracers used in- the 2022 and 2023 papers explain these seemingly different half-lives? Moreover, the new Figures S3B and S3C of [2]  show that, as opposite to the absolute SUV levels, the relative-SUV levels are not statistically significantly increased at the later cycles of the Galunisertib administration, which confirms the weakness of the SUV mathematical operator, alone, in highlighting areas of specific uptake (a notion that resonates with a popular paper in nuclear medicine literature: SUV, standard uptake or Silly Useless Value…? ). In absence of dynamic modeling of the TAC(t), the latter evidence points to a fully non-specific uptake of the probe in those organs for the reasons explained above, hence, additional validation techniques (discussed in the previous comment [1]) would need to be provided before claiming again, as we read in the conclusion of the new version of the pre-print, that this dataset ”demonstrates that the Galunisertib-driven increases in SUV were mostly specific, ..(and with the new data presented as) consistent with previous studies validating the specificity of the PET signal for areas of enhanced SIV replication in gut  and lymph nodes(Santangelo et al Nature Methods 2015 [4], Santangelo et al Mucosa Immunol. 2018 [5] and Samer et al JCI-Insight 2022 [3])”, i.e. before concluding that the new data supports the three previous non-human primate studies that fueled the rationale of the current pre-print study, and whose reproducibilities were questioned in the September 29th comment [1]. In my opinion, the three earlier nonhuman primate studies  [3-5]  and the new corrections made by the authors after the September 29th comment [1] reveal a possible common denominator that I will try to articulate in the next lines. The first two nhp studies (Santangelo et al.  Nature Methods 2015[4] and Santangelo et al. Mucosa Immunol 2018[5]) showed increase in the anti-env probe uptake of the blood pool (heart, BPA) of SIV infected animals, but the SUV levels of organs normalized on SUV levels of the Heart were not presented in those studies either. Based on the mean levels described for instance in Figure 1G of [4], the average increase in SUV in LNs of SIV infected animals compared to uninfected control is lower than the average increase in SUV of the Heart, hence the ratios (SUV of LNs over SUV Heart= BPA, relative-SUV) will most likely be lower or unchanged in the infected animals compared to the uninfected animals in both publications,  which again points to a fully non-specific nature of the increase in uptake seen in those organs of the infected hosts. With respect to the third 7d3 study [3], as discussed in the September 29th comment [1], the images of the seven animals published in that 2022 article before and after Galunisertib administration show that the increase in uptake post-Galunisertib can be, in principle, fully explained by non-specific uptake of the probe. Specifically, the increase in uptake in LNs could well be explained by unintentional subcutaneous administrations of the probe (as visible in the post-Galunisertib images, but not in the pre-Galunisertib images). The main reason for my conviction that those uptakes are not related to binding of the probe to the gp120 is that increases in probe uptakes post-Galunisertib are seen only in the clusters of lymph nodes close to those injection sites that show evidence of subcutaneous injection of the probe but they are not seen in other clusters of lymph nodes (and with the latter unintentional mistake made, coincidentally, only for images acquired post-Galunisertib administration). This evidence, alone, should be sufficient to present the extravasation due to an unintentional subcutaneous injection of the probe as a reasonable explanation for the observed increases in LNs probe uptake post-Galunisertib, as further articulated in that comment [1]. The latter, in conjunction with other evidence in antibody imaging literature cited and articulated in the previous comment [1], points also to a non-specific nature of the probe uptake in gut seen in some of the imaged animals post-Galunisertib administration. Another reason for my conviction, as also articulated in the previous comment, is that higher doses for longer period of administration in the 2023 study [2] did not produce in any of the 8 animals (after cycles 1) those high probe uptakes seen in the 2022 paper [3] (in which only one cycle was administered in most animals). To recap, none of the 7 animals of the Samer et al. 2022 paper [3] showed evidence of increase in the (absolute) SUV of the Heart, and there are reasons to believe that the increases in probe uptakes seen in LNs and the gut of the same paper are fully non-specific. This is similar to what the authors reported following the first cycle of the Galunisertib in the 2023 Kim et al. pre-print [2], in which , in fact, no statistically significant increases in absolute SUV levels were found in any tissue compartment, nor in the heart. So, the Samer et al.[3] images and the images of the first cycle in the Kim et al. pre-print [2] show whole-body biodistribution properties that are different from those seen in the images of the 2015 and 2018 monkey studies [4, 5] as well as in the later cycles of the 2023 pre-print study [2] in which animals showed increase in absolute SUV levels in tissues concomitant to increase in SUV levels of the Heart. In other words, if we agree that the increases in uptake in the LNs of the anti-env probe in Samer et al 2022 paper [3] would not be visible in those published images, had the needle of the i.v. injection been properly inserted into the vein, the common denominator of all these studies is that the SUV levels increase in the tissues only in animals in which the SUV levels of the heart also increase. A well posed question seems: what could cause changes in SUV levels of the heart? In general, as anticipated above, higher SUV levels in the heart, or blood pool activity, means longer half-life of the radiotracer.  Factors that could lead to increase in half-life of radiolabeled antibody\F(ab’)2 fragments include changes in isoelectric point ,  changes in the molecular weight of the radiotracer, level of dissociation of the radioisotope in the preparation or in vivo.  Radio-HPLC analysis of the radiolabeled compounds could help to exclude that changes in preparations of the radiotracers are behind changes in probe uptake of the Heart at 24 hr (for the [3] and [2]) or at 36 hr (for [4, 5]) post radiotracer injection. In the Samer et al [3] or in the new pre-print ,[2], based on what we read in the Methods sections, no pegylation was performed. But the latter was performed in the earlier two anti-env imaging studies [4, 5] . Pegylation can, in principle, change molecular size, isoelectric point, clearance, half-life of a modified probe…. The letter “p” is not defined in the article [3] but based on this PhD thesis online https://www.proquest.com/do... or the website www.resourcenhpir.com of the program that distributes these probes, it indicates the primatized version of the murine 7d3. Not only the new probe is a F(ab’)2 fragment, but it is based on a primatized version of the 7d3 (not on the murine intact IgG1 version used in the earlier two studies [4, 5]) and, for the reasons discussed above, it appears that it was not pegylated. Given all these differences, it would help not only to provide evidence that its binding affinity is retained but also  that the product is stable and most of the radioactivity in the product is explained by the radiolabeled protein, including in vivo. These data were not provided in any of the five monkey imaging studies so far in literature (by including in this count the 2023 pre-print), produced from the same imaging team, claiming the feasibility of imaging the virus in vivo using anti-env radiolabeled probes and nuclear medicine cameras [2-6] . Moreover, the whole-body radiotracer retention could, in principle, highlight other differences in the preparations of the radiotracers. Indeed, the evidence that with SUV scale =1, most images of the 2022 papers reveal a liver that is green and some animals a kidney that is also green (hence with an SUV less than 1, because to be 1 or above 1 the organ must be red when displayed on a rainbow scale 0-1), suggests that there is quite low radiotracer retention in the body at only 24 hours post radiotracer injection. Why the radiolabeled fragment clears out of the body so fast? So, If the images have been correctly reconstructed with proper decay correction, it appears that the SUV levels in the whole-body are much lower than one would expect at baseline with a F(ab’)2 radiolabeled protein. This could happen for instance if the radionuclide dissociated early post radiotracer injection, and would be immediately excreted from the body without leaving traces of it. Only dynamic and serial imaging during the first 24 hours could highlight this phenomenon. If that is the case, i.e. if a high significant portion of the injected dose is excreted soon, QC data for each radiosynthesis would need to be carefully reviewed. Note-z1. Note, while changes were made on November 8th in Figures and Supplemental material files of the Samer et al 2022 [3] paper, the main text is, for some reasons, still left unchanged, which would make the reading of the article very difficult (given the changes made in some of the Figures and video links), for instance there is still reference to video 9 or reference to changes in the heart, NALT and spinal chord of A14X004…. A new link has been however added to the JCI-Insight Samer et al [3] called Supplemental data-2 https://insight.jci.org/art..., highlighting the corrections that need to be made to the main text to make it compatible with the new changes made on the Figures as well as on the Supplemental Figures\Videos, although the reason for this unusual editorial format (changes to the main text reported in a supplemental material link rather than directly on the main text of the paper online) is unclear. The erratum corrige https://insight.jci.org/art... added by the Editor states : “ Figure 3F and Supplemental Video 5 were incorrectly scaled by the analytical software due to an input error”, and “In the online version, Supplemental Video 5 has been updated. The original Supplemental Video 8 showed the correct scaling of animal A14X004 and has been removed to avoid redundancy.”; In my opinion, however, it is not correct to state that the original Supplemental Video 8 (published on November 2022, up to November 8th 2023 version) showed the correct scaling of animal A14X004, because it was stated, up to the version preceding the November 8th 2023 version, that the scale was 1.5 not 1.0, consistent with the content of the September 29th comment [1]). So to enhance transparency a more appropriate  explanation seems the following  “The original Supplemental Video 8 of animal A14X004 was displayed with a lower scale than the one stated in the earlier version, like it was the case for the images of all other animals in the previous version of the paper, but Video 8 has been removed in the new version to avoid redundancy with Video 5\Figure 3F”. Even the latter explanation for the erratum corrige would not be sufficiently clear to the readers that have not read the previous versions. As explained above and in the earlier comment, [1], the video 5 and video 8 were dual representations of the same animal (A14X004) displayed with different SUV scales, because the objective was to highlight small differences in low levels uptakes between baseline and post-Galunisertib administration in organs, like the gut, that could not be well visualized by keeping all the organs in the same field of view with a low SUV scale. After the erratum corrige, one would still expect to be able to appreciate those differences (e.g. increase in gut uptake) with the earlier dual representation, which now is missing. Indeed, it is not possible to appreciate such differences in the gut of the new Video 5.  In other words, the two representations did not seem “redundant”, because the original dual representation was an attempt made to convey a new information about the whole-body biodistribution of A14X004. Note, the corrigendum also states : “Data from baseline (BL) and post-galunisertib weeks 1 and 2 (W1/2) were compared using Wilcoxon matched pairs nonparametric test, and the differences were nonsignificant with α > 0.05. The authors regret the errors.” However, there seems to be no explanation in the Methods section on how the SUV data are treated for animals that were imaged at both week 1 and week 2, and what statistical analyses were run (Wilcoxon or a mixed-effect model with the Holm-Šídák multiple comparisons test?). Finally, the removal of the NALT SUV analysis in the new version is a bit surprising, because, although there is evidence of PET and CAT misalignment for this animal, the latter is visible only at week 2, so it is not clear why baseline and week 1 SUV analysis of the NALT were also removed from Figure 3H. Note, as stated elsewhere in this document, that while the text of the 2022 Samer et al. paper is still unmodified, the Figures and videos have been all updated. However, the PMC link version of the paper https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go... still shows the older video 5 (scaled 0-0.3) and the older video 8 (by mistake placed in the video 1 link, now the new video 5 of the new version post-erratum-corrigendum of the Samer et al. 2022 JCI Insight publication [3]) or the older Figure 3H. Note, that Supplementary Figure S8 and video 8 of the new version  ( JCI-Insight on November 22 2023 to the Samer et al 2022 [3]) still show rainbow scale 1.5, not 1.0 as stated in the new legends. Changing the scale from 1.5 down to 1.0  would further increase those red levels on the images for this “control” animal and highlight (although with n=1 only) potentially important differences in whole-body biodistribution of the isotype matched pIgG1 control (whose catalogue number or chemical nomenclature is missing in both papers [2, 3]) compared to the anti-env probe, not explained by its affinity to an irrelevant antigen. Finally, we read in Samer et al 2022 [3]“Two additional rhesus macaques, A8L057 and 08M171, were infected with SIVmac239M2 …and used as controls for, respectively, Supplemental Figures 8 and 9 at, respectively, weeks 56 and 32 postinfection” ; 08M171 is also an ID in the 2023 pre-print [1]. This looks an editing mistake, the descriptions of the infection timeline for 08M171 in the two publications are indeed incompatible. 1.	mtg7x7eXMb, comment to Kim, ...Villinger, Martinelli  BioRxiv September 8th 2023. 2023. 2.

I have some general comments regarding the introduction and some of the figures outlined in this paper: Introduction: Tuberculosis is a dangerous and deadly airborne disease that can spread very easily. It would be nice to see statistics regarding the number of people infected in the world through the centuries or decades and more statistics of how many people die from this highly contagious strain, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Also, it would also be interesting to mention more information about the Mtb strain alongside the reason behind choosing this specific strain, instead of others. Figure 2: In Figure 2B, it was not indicated if the set of data shows gene expression of BL/6 compared to C3H, or the opposite way around. Alongside that, the data only shows that there is a significant difference, but does not show the magnitude of the significant difference. The y-axis is also supposed to have a negative in front of the “log10(padj)”. Also, figure 2C data did not specify which mouse strain compared to which, and it would be helpful if the sizes of the dotswere specified, too. In figure 2D, there wasn’t a color bar and scaling, so it wasn’t known what the red and blue represented and the magnitude was also not known. It would also be nice for a statistical test to be performed to see which genes were statistically significant for figure 2D as well. Figure 3: Figure 3B-C should have a Two-way ANOVA done for its statistical test because the groups compared are not all independent of each other, where the different variables could affect each other. In addition, there could be a statistical analysis done for figures 3D-G between the two different doses in addition to a power analysis to measure the effect size. Figure 4: Figure 4B could use a time series to prove that the mice are losing weight statistically. Also, the numbers on the y-axis of figures 4L-Q are not the same in the same range, which can possibly throw off the reader. Figure 5: Figure 5B does not have a statistical test performed between the different ETO concentrations. It would also be helpful to show the “+” and “-” signs. Figures 5C-D could use a control mice without infection to show that it is not just ETO that’s affecting the cell number. Otherwise, the paper was engaging and enjoyable to read.

I agree with the hypothesis that stuttering is caused by global motor inhibition, by a “freeze response”. However, I think it is important to distinguish between the reaction to a stop signal (where the person still experiences herself as the agent who controls his own behavior, even if the stopping is forced by a cue or a sudden danger) and a stutter block, where the person feels like the victim of an unknown internal power that inhibits speaking. If the stutterer could take the anticipation of stuttering as a cue to stop speaking, overt stuttering symptoms (repetition, prolongation, tension, grimacing) would not occur. But the stutterer can’t voluntarily stop at that moment; instead, speaking gets stopped against the speaker’s will. The feeling in a stutter block is: you can’t speak, and you can’t stop. Global inhibition by the person’s will (as a reaction to a cue or to a sudden danger) and global inhibition against the person’s will, felt like a transient loss of control (as in a stuttering), may involve similar neuronal networks, as both cause a similar “freeze” response. But there must also be a difference. Nevertheless, I think the idea of stuttering as a “freeze response” is a step forward. Global motor inhibition could be the automatic reaction to an invalid error signal in a motor sequence (Hickok, Houde, and Rong, 2011; Tian and Poeppel, 2012). Once such a “stutter mechanism” has been established in the brain, it could also be triggered by the anticipation of stuttering, as a result of operant conditioning.",2023-12-15T16:23:46,torstenhesse,Torsten Hesse,10.1101/2022.08.02.501857,Reactive Inhibitory Control Precedes Overt Stuttering Events,"Joan Orpella, Graham Flick, M.

Comparison two microelectrode mapping experiments might also reveal that BOLD and neural electrical activity (spikes) are not directly comparable and might give different mappings.

Intro, line 81:""Decisive is a big word with N=2 which are patients with a long disease history and very special treatment after amputation!

Results: I miss results from the toe mapping! Discussion, line 400f: I think there is consensus among most researchers that functional reorganization not necessarily requires underlying structural reorganization. Lines 405ff: It should be discussed that BOLD mapping probably is not equivalent to microelectrode mapping (Disbrow et al., 2000; Huettel et al., 2004).     You argue that top-down modulation might underly changed functional representations. Couldn't the ssame argument be applied here in that top-down or connections from the motor cortex during (imagined) movements modulate BA3b activation? Line 411f: I would say, it suggest the preservation of the structural connections determining the space for functional remapping.

Here are some comments I had about the paper: 1) Using both a rescue of the lrp4 -/- phenotype and the RNAi approaches in neurons and muscle to understand the role of LRP4 in synaptic formation and maturation was great. However, I believe the argument would have been even more convincing with the addition of additional figures demonstrating the success rate of RNAi inhibition. 2) I thought the sizes of samples used were great but the sampling was a little confusing. Since multiple NMJs from the same larva were analyzed as independent data points, it brought up questions about the effect of the sampling on the results. To resolve this problem, I would recommend either averaging the data acquired from multiple NMJ from the same larva and using it as a single data point or using a different way of analyzing data such as using a nested ANOVA. Overall, I really enjoyed reading the paper and it provided great insights into the complexity of synapse formation and maturation as well as the role of LRP4 within it.",2023-12-15T03:23:38,disqus_exulneIjo9,IVAN PAVLOVIC,10.1101/2023.11.03.564481,"Neuronal LRP4 directs the development, maturation, and cytoskeletal organization of peripheral synapses","Alison T.

I found your work to be fascinating and very relevant due to frequent antibiotic resistance occurring with many different bacteria. The importance of the work was very well emphasized. However, there were parts of the paper that were confusing and restricted my ability to understand the conclusion of the work performed. Below are a few suggestions that I hope you take into consideration: - Besides a few experiments, the statistical analysis tests were not listed in the paper. It is highly significant the test that is being performed is well known to the audience so that they can interpret how the data's significance was gathered. - In Figure 3, there are significant stars on the graphs, yet no test is listed for the audience to know. Additionally, I am still unaware of what is being compared in these figures and what the significance ultimately represents. - Presenting Figure 7 earlier in the paper and fully describing the xenophagy pathway that is proposed before LC3 and Bafilomycin, for example, are introduced in experiments will be very helpful. Because there was little to no explanation of LC3 and Bafilomycin in the paper, I initially did not understand why they were tested in the experiments. - Carry out more experiments that prove the xenophagy pathway to be true. For example, in Figure 7, mTOR is shown to be in the pathway, yet no tests were performed to make sure this aligns with the theory. - Avoid using similar controls to statistically compare it to many experiments carried out, such as Figure 1. This is because the more statistical tests that are run using the same control for the different treatments, there is a higher chance that one may result significant out of chance. What would be suggested would be carrying out control experiments for each treatment group. - The sample sizes are never given for experiments. To rely on the data and that there is not too little power, it would be very helpful to know the sample sizes of experiments. - Labeling is preferred to be consistent. For example, if ""Baf"" is used to indicate Bafilomycin, that abbreviation should be used to refer to Bafilomycin in all figures. This paper is very interesting and has the potential to go further as it is very important to understand how and why bacteria can resist antibiotics.

The organization of the paper allowed me to understand some of the intricate cellular processes that take place during synapse development and the presynaptic role of LRP4. Here are some general comments I had regarding the paper: 1. I liked that LRP4 expression at the pre-synaptic NMJ was confirmed using multiple experimental techniques including the LRP4-GAL4 driver for GFP expression, the CRISPR-cas9 mediated 3-HA epitope tagging and the co-staining with Brp. I believe that these results provided a strong foundation as to why LRP4 may serve functional and developmental roles near the active zone. 2. I found it helpful that the confocal images were accompanied by quantifications of what the researchers were looking at. I find that usually when there is too many images from staining, the reader can get confused on what exactly the focus is. The quantifications in this paper made it much easier to follow the results. 3. One thing that I was confused about was the sample sizes. I realized that multiple NMJs were taken from the same larvae in most of the figures and wasn’t sure how this would reflect on the results since they can’t be treated as independent data points. I would suggest using a nested-ANOVA or averaging the pseudo replicates per larvae to statistically account for this. 4. I would also prefer to see statistical differences between the experimental groups. I realized that in most figures the experimental groups were being compared to the control. I believe it would be a good way to confirm results if experimental groups were also compared.

The observation that the distance of a gene from nuclear speckles correlates with the splicing efficiency of its transcripts is very interesting and fits very well with an observation we made in trypanosomes, a highly divergent eukaryote. Trypanosomes are unicellular parasites responsible for sleeping sickness in humans. In order to survive in the mammalian host, it is essential that they express only one of more than 2000 antigens at any one time. By frequently switching the antigen they express, they can alter their surface coat and evade the immune system – a mechanism known as antigenic variation. Interestingly, we found that the single actively expressed antigen gene is located in close proximity to a nuclear locus enriched in pre-mRNA splicing factors (Faria and Luzak et al., 2021, Nature Microbiology; supported by Budzak et al., 2022, Nature Communications). Inactive antigen-coding genes do not show such spatial proximity and are located further away from the processing hotspot. Similar to the findings in the preprint, which show that nuclear speckle association of genes is dynamic and changes between cell types, we find that the interaction of the antigen gene with the splicing hotspot in trypanosomes is dynamic: upon activation of another antigen gene, the interaction with the previously active antigen gene is released and then re-established with the newly activated antigen gene. Our hypothesis in trypanosomes is the following: The active antigen gene is strongly transcribed by RNA polymerase I, and in order to ensure efficient processing of such large amounts of antigen pre-mRNA and to avoid its premature degradation, the transcribed antigen gene is brought into close proximity to a processing hotspot that provides the machinery for RNA maturation. Very cool to find the common principle that RNA processing can be regulated by 3D genome folding in such divergent organisms!",2023-12-13T12:39:02,,Siegel Lab,10.1101/2023.01.04.522632,3D genome organization around nuclear speckles drives mRNA splicing efficiency,"Prashant Bhat, Amy Chow, Benjamin Emert, Olivia Ettlin, Sofia A.

I am very happy that you enjoyed the preprint. As you suggested, I can provide some contextual information that will help on the understanding of the pointed issues. You indicate that our mention of AAP “phenology in freshwater lakes remains unknown” is inaccurate and there are already “few studies”. However, there is, up to our knowledge, no research that has been tracking the interannual variations and the recurrence (Phenology) of the AAP community in fresh waters. Here, we do not write that it is the first seasonal study of AAP in lakes, but the first study that focuses on the phenology of AAP community (three years in freshwater lake). In case you are aware of some studies that focus on AAP bacteria in freshwater lakes during several years, we would be very pleased. Regarding to the fluctuation of AAP abundance, you indicated that “it is unclear where this assertion comes from”, however, as described in materials and methods, AAP abundance was assessed using IR-microscopy. Since the paper is not based on manipulative experiments but observational samplings, no biological replicates were available and the AAP counts per sample (as described in M&M) can be found in Supplementary File S5. We agree that not statistical trends or deviations can be obtained from the graphical representation in Supplementary Figure S5, nevertheless, we tried to uncover relevant trends and show them also in the Supplementary Figure S7 and Supplementary File S6. AAP and bacterial numbers were calculated, as it is stated in M&M, using epifluorescence microscopy method as described in Piwosz et al., 2022 [17]. As you point out it is correct that lakes that are stratified might become anoxic in hypolimnion. However, despite the fact that there is a reduction of oxygen in the hypolimnion during summer, this is not the case for the illuminated to the bottom CEP lake (Supplementary File S5) which always presented an oxic environment. Additionally, this trend (oxic hypolimnion even during stratification) has been observed before in this same lake (Villena-Alemany et al., 2023. Diversity dynamics of Aerobic Anoxygenic Phototrophic Bacteria). Therefore, since CEP lake represents a fully oxic environment, the occurrence of anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs is negligible. Additionally, it is very well known that in anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs the expression of photosynthetic apparatus is repressed by oxygen. This indicates that the BChl-a signals that we observe from the fully oxic environment originates from AAP bacteria. Not only this but, in Kolesár Fecskeová et al., 2019 the expression of AAP phototrophic genes in this same lake was already proven. Regarding the “phototrophic Myxococcota”, in the reference 100, in the Supplementary Data of that paper are stated the environments from where the MAGs were reconstructed. There, it is indicated that several Myxococcota MAGs were repeatedly reported from oxic environments. We can agree that further researches need to be done to unveil the functionality of this recently discovered phototrophic group, and by writing about “potential significance in microbial communities” of Myxococcota we meant that there is the possibility they have an important role since they were recurrently detected during 3 years. As they are newly recognized phototrophic group, member of AAP bacteria, there is more research needed, but we can observe that they can be found recurrently in freshwater lakes. Furthermore, the AAP percent contribution is not related with the pufM gene database. It is calculated as the percentage of total bacteria that are AAPs. As described in Piwosz et al., 2022, all bacteria are counted using DAPI and AAP bacteria according to BChl-a fluorescence. We are really grateful that you liked the database and we believe and hope that it will be an excellent tool for people studying anoxygenic photosynthesis. Yes, the MAGs had a great contribution in our database, and we included as much pufM gene sequences as we could to improve the taxonomic assignment pufM gene amplicons. Naturally, it also encompasses pufM gene of anaerobic anoxygenic bacteria  and could also be used in anaerobic environments. Nevertheless, the category of AAP bacteria is a functional metabolic attribute, given to anoxygenic phototrophs in oxic environments, and the inclusion of anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophic MAGs into the database does not hamper the taxonomic assignation of AAP bacteria. I hope you find all the answers to the questions you stated here. I am really happy that you like the paper and to have this discussion. Looking forward if you have further contributions or thoughts.

Just by analogy of distances this is not enough. A physics-driven method would also provide some form of binding energy. Since the output here is simply a distance matrix I don't think it's fair to call this a physics driven method. The model also lacks a way to indicate confidence or ""binding energy"" if you will. What happens if I run the prediction on a pocket that does not contain a metal site? The model would still place the ion somewhere, no? Authors should explain how DisDock has the potential to accommodate the flexibility of both ligands and proteins. In l.47 or l76 authors state that rigid protein structures are used. Table 1 is confusing. Are the percentiles referring to mean distance between predicted and experimental position? This is only mentioned in the text but not in the caption Is 25% the best predictions or the worst ones? This is not clear. The authors also justify that they do not compare against Metal3D because it only was trained on zinc, yet they compare the predictor by Wang et.al trained only on copper with their method. For Metal3D it was also shown that it performs well for 10 of the 16 metals in the training set for DisDock even if it was trained only on zinc. The authors should also provide a segmented analysis of the performance of their method for the different metal ions in the dataset in the main text of the paper.  I don't think it makes sense to train the method on 5 CD sites and have actually 0 examples in the test set. In this case this metal should be excluded from training at all. For inference there seems to be a bit of divergence of where the actual metal is placed depending on the input search region. The authors should quantify this and provide a recommendation how many runs should be run starting from different location based on this analysis. Otherwise they cannot claim as in l.201 that the performance is consistent irrespective of the chosen initial location. In Figure S1 they just analyse the dependence on the starting distance. But there might also be an influence which equidistant starting point is used. For BioMetAll the authors should clearly detail in the methods section with what parameters the results have been computed and what is used as reference (any probe or just the cluster centers). It is also not correct that Metal3D takes the entire protein as input. Metal3D operates on residue centered voxel grids, that can be aggregated to compute a prediction for the whole protein but it is also possible to compute the binding probability around a specific residue. The authors should also clarify about code/data availability. Disclaimer: I am one of the authors of Metal3D (Simon Duerr).

However, what was really missing for me was a statistical comparison between the effects of those two treatments.

In addition, sentences like “Our results challenge the prevailing paradigm that NLR proteins exclusively signal via their N-terminal domains and reveal a signaling activity for the NB domain of NRC-dependent sensor NLRs.” make me feel like the novelty is “hyped”. The signaling activity of the NB domain presented here is passive, similar to a guardee. The guard model is not novel. This gives a bad impression on an overall good study. The study should be complemented. 1 Most importantly, interaction data between RxNB (and other NBs) and NRCs should be provided. 2 The quality of blots in fig 2 should be enhanced. 3 I think the lettuce experiments should be complemented with Q-PCRs to show that defense genes can be upregulated by Rx/NRCs. This should be required before suggesting the use of sensor/helper pair for crop improvement. Here are a few comments: I find it disturbing that the introduction mostly cites previous papers from the Kamoun lab. I think the use of Rx halves expressed in trans does not bring much to the study and to the understanding of Rx function. Rx full length triggers the same phenotype so why bother using halves? In addition, these halves do not behave like full length Rx in term of oligomerization thus they seem biologically irrelevant. Figure 1B. Red circle, why not Rx full length in red too? Caption: “Experiments were repeated 3 times with similar results” Did you perform 4 replicates of each experiment? Repeat once = done twice. Figure 2 V5 panel is not great. I only see a smear on the whole gel. What is signal, what is noise in this gel? I don’t think we can conclude anything from this. Plus, why should we care about what this chimeric truncation of a protein does? Figure 3D: Why use time point? There is no difference between 3/4/5dpi. Most importantly, where are eGFP and CP-GFP? Figure 4 is nice; I like this part. I would like to have the WB data in the main figure, it would be easier to read (to understand that accumulation is correlated to activity). However, this part could really benefit from protein interaction data. Figure 5: The chlorosis symptoms on the adaxial part of the leaves are not clear. You should remove this and keep only the abaxial pictures to avoid misleading the readers. Figure 6: This schematic is not great. Is the p-loop required for Rx activation or for NRC activation? Is it even a 2step process? Isn’t it just that CP activates NRCs by changing Rx conformation? Also, what do we know about Rx halves interacting together? The structure of the NRC resistosome is unknown, membrane insertion is unknown but here these are presented as facts. I hope this helps. Good luck with the publication!",2023-12-05T11:50:24,,guest,10.1101/2023.11.30.569466,The nucleotide binding domain of NRC-dependent disease resistance proteins is sufficient to activate downstream helper NLR oligomerization and immune signaling,"Mauricio P.

Unfortunately, I'm disappointed and even irritated. Berryhill et al. ignore (may be deliberately since the key info and refs present in the source which they do cite)  almost the whole body of knowledge about the O antigen-mediated shielding of E. coli the bulk of which (over the last 20 years) has been created by my lab with several important contributions form other teams, e.g. Martin Loessner's group (PMID 34784345). Among our papers this one  and the refs therein covers the essence of the question (PMID: 30814597). The systemic analysis of the current state-of-the-art in this field can be found in my review which I hope to see published shortly and now it is posted as a preprint ( https://www.preprints.org/m.... The phenomenon of narrow spectra of sensitivity of gut E. coli isolates to co-existing phages was also discovered by us (PMID: 17704275) and later studied in-depth and linked to the O-antigen mediated anti-phage protection (multiple papers are easy to find using my name as the keyword). The essential thing is that despite highly effective non-specific protection from of phage infection provided by E. coli O antigen, many phages have various mechanisms to penetrate the barrier. So the fact of this protection does not preclude phage infection in the community. The fact that humans seldom excrete virulent coliphages is long known (see our old review PMID: 19239553), and most probably is due to environmental constraints. The gut coliphage ecology is different in some other species such as  horses or pigs despite the omnipresent O antigens. The isolation of the phages by enrichment on a rough (lacking the O antigen) lab strain pre-programs the poor infectivity against most co-existing O antigen-proteceted isolates. By itself this result means nothing.

While we appreciate your feedback, we would like address here the points you raised. First, regarding the role of asymmetric tension. We appreciate that your J Phys Chem B (2022) paper tackles the role of membrane asymmetry in defining the budding direction. However, the role of asymmetric tension was reported first, to the best of our knowledge, by Thiam (DOI: 10.1016/j.bpj.2017.12.014), and then, in simulations, in our paper titled ""Membrane Asymmetry Imposes Directionality on Lipid Droplet Emergence from the ER"", published in Dev. Cell in 2019 (DOI: 10.1016/j.devcel.2019.05.003). Second, on maturation and budding. We read carefully your very interesting eLife paper, and we appreciate your contribution to understanding the role of seipin in scaffolding the neck of the nascent lipid droplet - as stated in our manuscript. However, lipid droplet maturation and budding are dynamic, non-equilibrium processes, in which the droplet grows and changes shape in time. We simulated growth and budding as dynamic processes, performing non-equilibrium simulations with non-constant number of particles, emulating lipid synthesis. The simulations in your paper (and all other simulations of lipid droplets in the literature, to the best of our knowledge) are equilibrium simulations, with a fixed number of lipids; they address equilibrium properties of *already budded* shapes, similar to experimental papers showing  *already budded* lipid droplets. Our work, instead, addresses the mechanism of budding as a dynamic process. Being dynamic processes, we maintain that growth and budding were never simulated before (nor observed experimentally, due to the insufficient time resolution of current experimental methods).

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.17.567504v1#comment-6333692831,biorxivstage,2,"I very much enjoyed reading your preprint and have a few small comments: In your abstract it is mentioned that AAP “phenology in freshwater lakes remains unknown”, but a few studies already exist that have tracked AAP fluctuations compared to environmental factors in different lakes. It could be argued that there is still more to learn, each lake may have AAP populations fluctuating differently based on particular factors, and they can be monitored differently, but there have been previous studies nonetheless. Perhaps a small rewording will suffice, maybe suggesting your first integration of AAP into a PEG model, rather than first seasonal study of AAP in lakes. The paper suggests that AAP fluctuate by season, with a spring maximum and then a resurgence in the fall, but it is unclear where this assertion comes from. First, there are no numbers or variance provided, except for a singular maximum of 3.42 - 5.50 × 105 cells/ mL. How much did they vary per replicate vs per season or per year? Did they reach the same maximum each year or were less found for one particular season? Fig S5 is only a heat-map of data, and while the colours are nice, it is unclear if different years had similar trends/ deviation. It would appear that 2017 had an outright absence of enumerated AAP vs 2018 or 2019, and this discrepancy may hinder correlative analysis. In addition, it is not clear how the AAP numbers were calculated, was it from the BChl a autofluorescence microscopy counts? In the manuscript there is mention of the lake becoming stratified, which leads me to conclude that there is a strong possibility for anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs to be present. As lakes have a fall turn-over (mixing), couldn’t the fall resurgence of detected BChl a autofluorescence not be of “AAP”, but instead be a mix (or predominantly) be made up of anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs? What evidence is provided that your measurements aren’t of both aerobic and anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs containing BChl a? Similar reasoning additionally questions if “phototrophic Myxococcota” are aerobic or anaerobic. The reference #100 shows that Myxococcota puf genes could be transferred into the anaerobic Rba. sphaeroides, which suggests it may be a (facultative?) anaerobe, not necessarily an aerobic phototroph. In addition, those authors suggested these Myxococcota have CO2 fixation – another indication of being anaerobic. Also, your nice story ends with a suggestion that while the Myxococotta “contribution was low”, that they are “potentially significant”. In what way are they significant? Perhaps showing some numbers into their contribution, or expanding upon this may support the implied significance. The puf database appears to be a really good asset. However, it is unclear how the AAP percent contribution of the bacterial community Fig S5E was calculated. While the puf database was used for looking into the variability of AAP populations within the community of anoxygenic phototrophs, there is no mention of how you chose AAP of the total community of bacteria that do not have pufM. Presumably you used the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes, but no list of AAP genera chosen for this analysis is provided or cited. Furthermore, while your puf database is indeed impressive, it is stated in-text to be composed of not just type material, but also MAGs (of high quality). While useful to show off diversity of sequences, MAGs do not provide concrete evidence of the respiration statues of any bacterium, particularly if the MAG is divergent from known AAP. Taken together, because your study followed the genes/ autofluorescence of not just AAP, but potentially of all anoxygenic phototrophs, I suggest providing content explaining how you sorted each group separately. If the levels of BChl a containing bacteria are detected by autofluorescence alone, then it is tracing all anoxygenic phototrophic populations, not solely aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs. If your pufM genes are closely related to MAGs that have not been proven to respire and produce BChl a aerobically, then those reads cannot be linked to AAP specifically. Instead, they are putative anoxygenic phototrophs with undetermined oxic tolerances.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.06.561180v1#comment-6332982781,biorxivstage,1,"Deep mutational scanning has revealed the impact of individual point mutants on protein function and improved computational predictors of mutational effects. However, many mutations observed in evolution and disease are the result of insertions or deletions (indels) and the impact of these mutations are poorly predicted computationally relative to missense mutations. While a few other papers have profiled InDels in a systematic way, the major contributions of this paper are: 1) profiling indels across many different proteins (9), 2) profiling InDels for both stability and function, 3) introducing the concept of high throughput profiling of DelSub mutations (Mutations that remove an aa and substitute an aa in a single event) The authors make a library of substitutions, insertions and deletions of 9 protein domains. They carry out deep sequencing coupled to  fragment complementation assay (aPCA) that is well correlated with expression/stability. They then go deep on two peptide binding domains, comparing functional mutational scans as well. This provides a rich set of data to compare to computational predictions, where notable limitations in current prediction methods are identified. The major limitation of the paper is in the presentation - there is a lot of data and the figures are quite complex - but the text is brief and difficult to follow in parts. An expanded text and breaking up the figures into more figures would likely improve the ability to extract insights from these impressive datasets. Additionally further discussion of the results within the context of past literature would be helpful in guiding interpretation of the study. **Major points:** - The authors included 9 domains that span classical motifs to include in their indel scan. From our reading, it is unclear what rationale the authors used to include these domains. What makes these a diverse set of domains (a/b content? size? eukaryotic/prokaryotic origin? other topological features? etc)? This will help the reader understand how to generalise the results. - In section “Evaluating indel variant effect prediction”, authors can comment on why PROVEAN is better suited to predict insertions and deletions relative to substitutions. In contrast, why CADD predicts substitutions better than PROVEAN? What design choices can distinguish PROVEAN from CADD? Is there a way a model could be trained that could perform well on both? - In the section “Structural determinants of indel tolerance,” the authors mention multiple features that seem potentially important for the effects of insertions and deletions. Currently specific patterns are discussed for the substitutions but the main draw of this manuscript it contains indel mutagenesis across many proteins and the discussion in this section regarding indels are vague beyond that indels are more tolerated at the N and C termini, that the secondary structure is important, and where the indel is seems to have an impact. Currently in our reading these are vague descriptions and perhaps it would be possible to describe general trends? What specific lengths are tolerated vs not? Which secondary structural elements are more sensitive? It would be helpful to clarify these trends with existing literature. For example, previous work in a potassium channel kir2.1 (Macdonald, CM, Genome Biology 2023) found that deletions were more disruptive than insertions in beta sheets especially. Is that also seen? - The authors train a model as described in the ‘Accurate indel variant effect prediction’ section to predict the effects of indels within all the proteins that are contained within the screen and another manuscript Tsuboyama et al. However, there are other previous indel scans that have been done including one within a viral AAV capsid protein ( www.science.org ="""" doi="""" 10.1126="""" science.aaw2900="""">), a potassium channel kir2.1 ( genomebiology.biomedcentral... ="""" articles="""" 10.1186="""" s13059-023-02880-6#citeas="""">), and an amyloid protein that involved the senior author ( pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ="""" 36400770=""""/>). It may be useful to test performance of the model on these datasets that were not generated within the same study and discuss where the model performs well vs those that do not perform as well. - The authors find that insertions can generate gain-of-function molecular phenotypes at higher rates relative to deletions and substitutions. Overall, the manuscript presents the results of deep indel mutagenesis on several protein domains, but lacks thorough discussion of the results. A discussion addressing the possibility of non-native ligand binding following indel mutations would provide an evolutionary perspective that contextualises this research. - The authors mention that some gain-of-function mutations occur due to short insertion mutations. While some domain insertions have been shown to have stabilising effects ( doi.org ="""" 10.1371="""" journal.pcbi.1006008="""">, doi.org ="""" 10.1038="""" s41467-018-08171-0="""">, www.nature.com ="""" articles="""" s41467-021-27342-0="""">), the findings presented here are novel for being short insertions but prior work on domains and deletions of varying type being beneficial would be useful. Emphasising this in the “Insertions generate gain-of-function molecular phenotypes” section and considering how the insertions in the PSD95-PDZ3 domain might increase stability would enhance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving these gain-of-function phenotypes. - Related to gain-of-function: The last sentence of the discussion section references the potential usefulness of indel mutagenesis for protein engineering. As the paper notes, the results here will impact the protein engineering field significantly, so further discussion here will help extend the reach of this paper. Discussing what protein engineering strategies would be enhanced (e.g. directed evolution) would help the reader in evaluating the impact of the data presented. There are a few related papers in the literature (e.g.[ https://doi.org/10.1073/pna... ]( https://doi.org/10.1073/pna... that could support this. **Minor points:** - Several of the figures are very information-dense. This manuscript would benefit from breaking up these figures and reorganizing them to make them easier to understand. It may be helpful also to focus the figures on the main points the authors would like to make within the manuscript as currently the sheer amount of data and analyses makes it difficult to follow the narrative. Additionally, figures could benefit from having secondary structure representations above or below heatmaps to aid in interpretation. - Figure 1 contains A-C labeled sections but contains 9 comprehensive experiments with 6 subpanels each. It is very difficult to evaluate the data when it is so densely represented. aligning an “unfolded” secondary structure below the heatmap for all domains might be clearer than colouring by secondary structure. We find secondary structure coloring to obscure the patterns. - Figure 2 would benefit from significant reorganization perhaps around SH3 and PDZ domains specifically. The spacing within this figure makes it difficult to follow the immense amount of comparisons contained here. Perhaps it would be worth separating this figure up or moving some of the comparisons to the supplement. As in Figure 1 secondary structure above or below the heatmaps would be helpful. - In figure 5E data is shown for GRB2-SH3 in which some mutants show high binding and low abundance. Additionally these mutants are most prevalent in the core and surface. What could be an explanation for such a phenotype for core mutants, since they are bound to have the most destabilizing effect. For the surface mutants, are those residues close to the binding site? Additionally the distributions of these two plots look fundamentally different (with a much higher correlation between binding and abundance for PDZ and a distinct change in the pattern of binding residues being gain or loss of function across the two domains). What does that say about the baseline stability of GRB2 vs PSD95? Or is this more representative of some methodological aspect of the dynamic range and sensitivity within respective assays when run on these specific proteins? - In the heatmap figures the coloring is confusing. Currently they are colored from red to white to blue - in the corresponding color bars next to the heatmaps white is not centered at 0. Presumably 0 is wildtype fitness and blue and red are greater and less than wildtype fitness, respectively. This should be explicitly stated within all figure legends. White should correspond to 0 otherwise it makes it difficult to determine the effect of a mutation. - Figure 3E contains violin plots however a boxplot is missing from these that indicates the median, interquartile range, and whiskers to represent non-outlier distributions. This would be useful in comparing across these variant types - In ‘Materials and Methods’ section, we were confused by the filtering steps taken in the ‘sequence data processing’ section. It would be helpful to include the minimum read cut-off. - Figure 4b should be explained more completely in the figure legend. It is very difficult to make out what the difference in colour for each panel means. - In the last paragraph of the introduction, it would provide additional support and context if you referenced other work with similar findings.

I especially like the testing of different homology arm lengths. The use of non-plant exonucleases is very innovative. I have one comment which I think is needed and would improve the paper .With the Arabidopsis transformants it reads like you are screening in the T1 generation. Is this correct? If so I think it should be made explicit in the paper. Assuming they are T1 plants I think it is important to indicate what proportion of T1 transgenic plants have undergone successful HDR using the donor template. It looks like your experimental design makes it difficult to quantify this as there is not another selection cassette on the T-DNA beyond the GL1 sgRNA which produces a phenotype which cannot be selected for in these mutants if not grown on thiamine. The growth of the thiC mutants on media lacking thiamine necessarily selects against transgenics where T-DNA integration has occurred and HDR has not. As it stands I think the number of seeds sown in this experiment needs to be documented at a minimum. However I would suggest repeating that experiment with a T-DNA which allows selection for transformants on thiamine selected media and either screening T1 plants via PCR and maybe growing on media lacking thiamine in the T2 generation, perhaps the editing of gl1 in the T1 generation can indicate which T2 families should be screened. This would give a better picture of the efficiency especially if people are interested in targeting loci without a phenotype so amenable to selection",2023-11-27T16:40:43,disqus_OzaiuqP6Ey,Geoffrey Thomson,10.1101/2023.11.24.568561,Efficient scar-free knock-ins of several kilobases by engineered CRISPR/Cas endonucleases,"Tom Schreiber, Anja Prange, Petra Schäfer, Thomas Iwen, Ramona Grützner, Sylvestre Marillonnet, Alain Tissier",2023-11-25

We appreciate that you find the manuscript to be of interest and we will try to address your comment in the next version. It is true that domestic dogs show adaptations to omnivory compared to wolves (which is what the original diet dataset would have scored), so the carnivory score for dogs may be mismatched. However, it is unclear how much of a mismatch it would be. Dog domestication happened relatively recently (~15,000 years; https://doi.org/10.1126/sci..., https://doi.org/10.1093/mol...), so a signal of selection for carnivory may still be detected, given the hypercarnivorous evolutionary history of the lineage.",2023-11-27T16:10:33,matthewdpollard,Matthew D.
