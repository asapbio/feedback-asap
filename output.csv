https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.25.650714v1#comment-6702404410,biorxivstage,1,"The manuscript by Stanhope et al. investigates the role of the one-carbon metabolism enzyme S-Adenosylhomocysteinase (Ahcy) in the alteration of neurodegeneration gene expression in Drosophila. The authors found that oxidation of C195 of Ahcy inhibits its activity, leading to neuroprotective changes in gene expression through an unknown mechanism. The findings highlight the importance of C195 oxidation in Ahcy, potentially limiting enzyme activity in a metabolism-dependent manner. We agree with the authors’ conclusions and we provide major and minor comments below to assist in the clarity and ease of interpretation of the manuscript. Major comments - Please provide more information on Ahcy and AhcyL1, e.g. how many cysteines does Ahcy contain? Does AhcyL1 respond to blue light stress? - Line 55, please include a brief explanation of the redox proteomics approach and whether it was concluded that C195 is involved in a disulfide bond. We suggest discussing early on from structural prediction of Ahcy whether the two cysteines (C195 and presumably C228) are in close proximity for a disulfide bond to form as otherwise it is unclear what is meant by oxidation of C195 (it could be e.g. a sulfenic acid) and what the ‘second’ cysteine is. - Fig1E, include samples with reductant and oxidant +/- labeling to show where the fully reduced or oxidized protein migrates. There appears to be a slight band present in the “second labeled cys” in the C195S, which would contradict the statement in Line 99. Could you comment on it. Although not required for the conclusions, including protein samples from flies that are blue light-treated would inform on whether Ahcy-C195 becomes oxidized. - We found it quite striking that the RNAi lines for AhcyL1 were also displaying a low level of Ahcy. Could it be an issue of sequence identity between Ahcy and AhcyL1 leading to off-target effects? Or could AhcyL1 positively regulate Ahcy gene expression? Also, could you explain the modest changes in the expression of AhcyL1 in the AhcyL1 line? - Fig2D, E, how do you explain the variation in AhcyL1 and Gnmt between the three Ahcy RNAi lines? Consider revising line 126-127: “without any corresponding changes in AhcyL1” as there are changes. - Line 255, it would be of interest to provide more discussion of the discrepancy between this work and the previous work which showed Ahcy-dependent enhancement of H3K4me3. Line 273, consider revising this sentence as it was not shown here that Ahcy promotes methylation, which data indicate this point? Minor comments - Figures, figure panels are mostly small, with large white space between them. Increasing panel size and image fidelity would help to fully visualize data (e.g. Fig. 2A, 4E). Figure 1E, increasing the size and brightness/contrast would be good too. - Line 43, consider revising 'higher' to another term (e.g. multicellular organisms) because 'higher’ assumes that complexity increased with the evolution of eukaryotes, which is not always the case. - Line 70, briefly describe S2 cells and why they are being used here. - Line 77, define TMT. - Lines 81-84, repeated information from introduction that could be removed or condensed. - Fig1A, we found it unusual to include previously published data, is that because it wasn’t displayed as a graph in the previous study? - Fig1B, add arrowheads and acronyms by the molecules (SAM, SAH) and an arrow indicating inhibition of methyltransferases. - Fig 1E, define “IGMR”. - Line 108, cite also Fig1C. - Line 113, refer to Fig2A instead of Fig1A. - Line 115, add Fig2A for the Ahcy interaction with itself. - Line 140, refer to Supp Fig2B instead of 2A. Could you describe the data presented in Supp Fig2B in the legend. - Lines 146-147, refer to Fig 3A only instead of 3A & 3B, as you are describing catalytic efficiency (kcat/km). - Line 158, could you discuss further how else C. elegans Ahcy differs from Drosophila? Maybe provide an alignment of the full protein sequences in supplemental. Are there other key differences between Drosophila and C. elegans Ahcy in structure or function? The rate shown in Fig. 3B appears different at lower SAH rates specifically, is this relevant? - Line 170, refer to Supp Fig2A instead of 2B. Figure 3E, add adenosine label. Could adenosine come from cleavage of NAD+ in these conditions? Or is the product of SAH hydrolysis (adenosine) still complexed with the enzyme Ahcy upon purification? - Line 180, refer to Fig3A instead of 3B. - Line 181, consider including the structure of the C195S mutant (does it accumulate to wild type level or does the mutation destabilize the protein?) - Lines 191-192, do you have other evidence than structural ones that suggests that C195 is completely protected from solvent (i.e., H2O2) when NAD+ is bound? - Line 207, add the word cells after ""photoreceptor"" - Figure 2, could you include in the legend what is meant by 3% input? In “(A) Ahcy, AhcyL1, and AhcyL1 in S2 cells” should read Ahcy, AhcyL1, and AhcyL2 in S2 cells. - Fig2A, there’s a lower band for AhcyL1-V5 in the input, is that a N-term truncation product (if V5 is in C-term)? - Fig 2C-E, the style of displaying the statistics on these graphs are initially a bit misleading as the straight lines across multiple bars seem to indicate significance across all the bars under the line, but on further inspection it might be representing a statistical comparison between the bars at the end of each line. It might be helpful to use bracketed lines instead of straight lines that point directly to the bars been compared. - Fig2C-F, the RNAi lines used in these panels are referenced in the Supplementary Table 1, but this table is missing. - Line 250, when discussing redox sensing, and the lack of Set1 oxidation in your previous analysis, clarify whether only cysteines were analyzed. It could be that methionine for example are oxidized in their sulfoxide form and possess a regulatory role. - Lines 263-265, maybe rephrase “when compared both with untreated Ahcy RNAi flies and with mCherry RNAi flies exposed to blue light” to “when compared with mCherry RNAi flies exposed to blue light” because the untreated Ahcy RNAi flies had lower levels than the treated ones, and the original wording suggests that the treated is lower than the untreated. - Lines 296-297, missing space between using and anti. - Line 332, include the specific type of qPCR kit used. - Figure 4B, could you explain in the legend what the dashed arrows represent or are showing? - Figure 4E, could you orient the non-initiated reader as to how these data are compared, how can one tell the differences observed e.g. between Ahcy RNAi blue light vs. control blue light is not significant?

Your research is quite novel and brings interesting implications for the further development use of RNA biotech in aquaculture. Summary Summary: This paper demonstrated a novel approach of feeding fish E.coli engineered to express double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a vector. The authors demonstrated that non-invasive dsRNA delivery via feeding technique can knock down the dnd gene during PGCs migration and differentiation in S. schlegelii. The authors demonstrated that transformed E.coli vectors can be combined with rotifers, brine shrimp and dry feed to serve as an effective means of introducing dsRNA. Introduction A comprehensive review and introduction on the topic was given. Objective was clearly stated and achieved. Materials & Methods Methods are straightforward and easy to follow. Someone who is not necessarily an expert in aquaculture or RNAi technology would be able to understand how this experiment was conducted. Methods are put in succinct and desirable detail. The inclusion of a figure to represent the construct generated did enhance the section but would have benefited from a caption rather than representation at the end of the paper. Including supplementary material on primers specific sequence would also be good to add for improved reproducability. Results The results of this experiment were very interesting. An approximated 50% of fish displayed dysplasia in their gonads. Insinuating that a large number of these fish would be infertile. Taking off target effects into account would have been useful, but did not seem to be tested for in this experiment. I viewed your paper on biorxiv, so this may have contributed to formatting issues, but I found it difficult to interpret some figures because they were displayed at the end of the article without an explanatory paragraph. This made full interpretation difficult and required heavier interpretation by the reader. You explain your results in the discussion which allows an attentive reader to understand the results. Discussion The significance and relevance of your results are clearly explained. The value not only in scientific but also commercial realms is illuminated to draw maximum There is some conjecture that the gonads in the fish are ideal candidates for germ cell transplantation. However it is not clear that these gonads would be functional, especially considering the dysplasia and sex reversal observed in many individuals. In lines 462 through 463, describing these fish as ideal recipients for PGCs is dubious due to seemingly described gonad dysfunction and deformity. Further exploration on how gonads could be made useable would help to backup this view. Figures Some issues in viewing the figures may be due to the nature of how I viewed the document, however the imaging of gonads would have benefitted from additional explanation. Comparison between normal and altered gonads would have made the significance of these images more understandable. Tables (a) & (b) lacked a nearby description which made interpretation difficult. A way to demonstrate recorded effects over sampling time in a table or graph would have been favorable as well. Also including a figure categorizing gonad manifestation would have been useful. References They are well arranged, easy to understand and suitable for this paper. Overall Review This paper presented very novel techniques and had fascinating results. Someone with adequate technical skill could replicate this experiment. I wonder if this can be applied to the more efficient creation of transgenic organisms, vaccine delivery and other benefits. I look forward to reading about more applications of this research.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.03.641271v1#comment-6701086194,biorxivstage,1,"The paper focuses on the discovery and synthesis of small molecules that target the p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT), a key enzyme involved in epigenetic regulation. The researchers identify a series of N-phenylbenzamide analogs, including activators (YF2, RA010900, RA010160, RA010168) and inhibitors (JF1, JF10, JF16), exploring their effects on lysine acetylation of histone 3 at residues K18 and K27. Through structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis, the study found that the alkyl side chains and specific substitutions on the N-phenylbenzamide scaffold critically influence whether a compound activates or inhibits p300. Despite its poor metabolic stability and rapid degradation in human and murine liver microsomes, YF2 emerged as the lead molecule for its strong activation profile. The paper effectively supports its conclusions through clear data presentation, including detailed chemical structures, metabolic stability tables, and molecular docking simulation. Figures illustrate the structural differences between activators and inhibitors, while enzyme activity data (EC50 and IC50 values) validate the authors’ hypotheses. However, the study lacks a direct comparison of docking scores, making it challenging to contextualize binding efficiency across compounds. Nonetheless, YF2's successful docking into the p300 bromodomain binding site, along with its SAR insights, provides a solid foundation for future optimization of HAT modulators, offering promising therapeutic avenues for treating neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and certain cancers. Introduction: The introduction effectively sets the stage for the study by clearly outlining the importance of histone acetyltransferases (HATs), particularly p300, in epigenetic regulation and its relevance to diseases such as Alzheimer’s and cancer. It provides a well-structured explanation of how histone acetylation affects gene expression and protein synthesis, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of targeting p300. The authors also successfully highlight the gap in current research, noting the limitations of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and the need for more selective HAT modulators. This thoughtful framing makes a compelling case for why their work on designing novel small molecules to modulate p300 activity is both innovative and necessary. The inclusion of the background information on the structural domains of p300 and its functional overlap with CBP adds further depth, helping readers grasp the enzyme’s complexity and prodrug potential. There are a few areas for improvement though. While the introduction presents a strong scientific rationale, it could benefit from a more streamlined discussion of the p300/CBP structural features, as certain sections verge on being overly technical without immediate relevance to the study’s aims. Although the authors mention previous HAT activator scaffolds like CTPB, they do not sufficiently explain their limitations beyond solubility and permeability, missing an opportunity to underscore how their new compounds address these shortcomings. A clearer statement of the study’s specific hypotheses, beyond the general goal of identifying p300 modulators, would strengthen the narrative and better guide the reader into the results section. Overall, the introduction is solid and informative but could benefit from slight refinement for focus and impact. Results: The results section presents a clear and methodical exploration of newly synthesized N-phenylbenzamide analogs designed to modulate p300 activity. The study effectively categorizes these compounds into activators (YF2, RA010160, RA010168, RA010900) and inhibitors (JF1, JF10, JF16), providing enzyme activity data (EC50 and IC50 values) for histone 3 acetylation at lysine 18 and 27. Notably, YF2 emerged as a strong p300 activator, showing EC50 values of 155.01 nM (K18) and 72.54 nM (K27). The figures, such as Figure 1 and Table 1, are clear and easy to interpret, directly supporting the authors’ claims. Also, the metabolic stability tables highlight YF2’s limitations, revealing a poor half-life of 10 minutes in murine and 4.35 minutes in human liver microsomes, pointing to the need for further optimization. Despite these strengths, the results section has some limitations. While the structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis effectively links molecular modifications to biological activity, like how smaller alkyl groups promote activation and longer, branched chains drive inhibition, there is a lack of direct docking score comparisons. This omission makes it challenging to fully contextualize YF2’s binding efficiency relative to other compounds. Furthermore, while YF2’s molecular docking into the p300 bromodomain is visualized and described, a more quantitative comparison of binding affinities would strengthen the conclusions. Overall, the results are well-supported by data, but additional docking metrics and a clearer link between metabolic findings and compound design strategies would enhance the section’s impact. Discussion: The discussion section effectively describes the findings within the broader context of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) research, emphasizing the therapeutic significance of p300 modulators. The authors highlight how their study builds upon previous work involving small-molecule HAT activators like CTPB and CTB, which were hindered by low potency and poor pharmacokinetics. By designing N-phenylbenzamide analogs, they address these limitations and identify both p300 activators (YF2, RA010168, RA010900) and inhibitors (JF1, JF10, JF16), advancing the field by offering a new chemical framework with improved activity. The paper stresses the relevance of HAT activation as a promising strategy for enhancing histone acetylation, particularly for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and contrasting it with the more commonly studied HDAC inhibition. This shift from HDAC to HAT targeting reflects a nuanced approach to epigenetic drug discovery. The discussion could benefit from more direct comparisons to the potency and pharmacokinetics of prior compounds like CTPB and CTB to better highlight the progress made. While the paper acknowledges YF2's strong p300 activation profile, it downplays its poor metabolic stability, mentioning it only as a future optimization target without exploring strategies for improvement. Although the structure-activity relationship (SAR) insights are valuable for linking side chain and alkyl group modifications to compound behavior, the discussion stops short of offering predictive models or design principles for future analogs. A more critical reflection on the challenges of balancing activation potency with metabolic stability would strengthen the discussion’s impact. The section solidly contextualizes the research but could benefit from deeper analysis of the study’s limitations and clearer comparisons to previous findings. Suggestions: This paper presents a strong foundation in the development of p300 histone (HAT) modulators, with the key discovery of N-phenylbenzamide analogs that act as either activators or inhibitors; however, a clearer hypothesis regarding the mechanistic underpinnings of how specific structural changes drive either activation or inhibition would sharpen the study’s impact. The results section effectively supports the study's claims through clear data presentation, including well-labeled figures and tables, but one notable gap is the lack of docking score comparisons via graphing tools, which limits the ability to fully contextualize YF2’s binding efficiency relative to other analogs. Including this data would provide a more robust evaluation of each compound’s molecular interaction with p300, further reinforcing the SAR analysis. These visual comparisons, such as graphs mapping SAR trends or docking results, would enhance the clarity and impact of the presented data. The discussion successfully contextualizes the study within the broader scope of HAT research, contrasting the new analogs with previous compounds like CTPB and CTB; however, the discussion does not fully address the poor metabolic stability of YF2, mentioning it briefly without proposing solutions. Suggesting strategies, like pro-drug approaches, targeted structural modifications, or lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery, would strengthen the discussion’s practical relevance. While the SAR insights are well-documented, the paper stops short of exploring why certain side-chain modifications shift compounds from activators to inhibitors, beyond size considerations. A speculative explanation based on molecular modeling or enzyme dynamics would add depth to the analysis. While the study employs appropriate methods of molecular docking, cell-free enzymatic assays, and metabolic profiling, there are clear areas for improvement. The lack of in vivo validation leaves a critical gap, as the compounds' efficacy and toxicity remain untested in a physiological context, which is necessary for drug development. Addressing YF2’s instability is also crucial, as the current data raise concerns about its drug viability. Overall, the paper presents innovative findings and expands the field of p300 modulation, but revisions should focus on providing strategies for improving YF2’s stability, including more comparative docking data, and offering deeper mechanistic insights into the activator and inhibitor behavior of N-phenylbenzamide analogs. With these enhancements, the study would be a strong candidate for publication in high-impact journals like the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry or ACS Chemical Biology.",2025-05-07T00:48:26,disqus_zNEHHjaT83,Young Cho,10.1101/2025.03.03.641271,Design and Synthesis of Potent First-in-Class Histones Acetyltransferase Modulators,"Elisa Zuccarello, Mattia Mori, Elisa Calcagno, Rosa Purgatorio, Yan Feng, Erica Acquarone, Yitshak I.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.25.640236v1#comment-6701084260,biorxivstage,2,"General comments The study provides a great baseline using a novel perspective that connects carcinogenesis to observed epigenetic changes and can benefit future understanding of the effects of formaldehyde exposure. References are effective and well-executed. The title is appropriate. The Abstract appropriately summarizes the study, but could benefit from mentioning the ambiguous response to dose concentrations. Organization and language are appropriate and effective. While the study has great potential to benefit the field, statistical analysis between groups and figures are of particular concern and prevent publication of the study in a prestigious journal. Introduction The introduction clearly reports the gaps in knowledge of FA exposure carcinogenesis which the study hopes to bridge. Current studies relating to the topic are referenced. Objectives are clearly stated. Lacking some justification for the methodology. Methods The methods are well explained, reproducible and appropriate as they provided a representative cell line to study the effects of FA. Furthermore, the use of LC and tandem MS/MS allowed for precise peptide separation and identification. The simplicity of this experimental design allows for the responses to the treatments to be clearly identified, and creates the baseline for further examination into FA exposure carcinogenesis. Statistical analysis methods need revision. Results: Thorough explanation of figures and results. For comparison between groups, and particularly for PTM-combined peptide fragments, additional statistical tests may be required for proper analysis since PTM-combined groups may not be independent. Figures clearly present the data and support for the researcher’s conclusions. They are effective in showing comparisons between different sites and effects of formaldehyde exposure. Because most figures are box-and-whisker plots, color selection of each figure could be more intentional. The number and sizes of the figures is excessive, particularly since some data described in the figures are not included in the discussion. Discussion The discussion extensively interprets the results using epigenetic cancer markers described by previous studies, but is overly focused on the application of observed epigenetic changes directly to cancer, potentially overlooking confounding effects between the two. Strengths of the study are briefly discussed. Despite mention of exogenous vs endogenous FA exposure in both the abstract and introduction, there is little discussion of how the results of the current study elucidate the DNA adduct hypothesis. Generally, the discussion also lacks possible future directions and assertion of the valuable baseline that the study provides for future research. Weaknesses of the study are also not thoroughly discussed. Increased suppression in response to the lower concentration groups should also be further discussed, possibly with the suggestion that further studies should focus on a wider range of concentrations and exposure durations.

In addition to the non-parametric one-way ANOVA, consider a non-parametric comparison such as Dunn’s test with correction instead of the student’s t-test. Results Section 2.1: Table 1 and Table 2 take up a large amount of space, and fragments with large p values serve little purpose.

Your study provides valuable insights into the role of DNA methylation in crop domestication, particularly in understanding how cultivation practices shape epigenetic patterns over time. Below, we provide our review of your manuscript. Summary Your study investigates the influence of domestication on DNA methylation patterns in grapevines by comparing wild and cultivated accessions using reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing. Your team found that cultivated grapevines exhibit higher overall methylation, with almost 10,000 differentially methylated cytosines, most of which are in non-coding regions. Functional analysis links core methylated genes to stress response and terpenoid/isoprenoid metabolic processes, while differentially methylated genes are associated with ethylene regulation, histone modifications, and defense responses. The study also suggests that the geographic origin of grapevine varieties partially influence DNA methylation patterns, contributing to region-specific epigenetic signatures. Introduction Your introduction highlights the gap in research regarding the role of epigenetics in grapevine domestication. You provide a strong rationale for studying DNA methylation as a mechanism underlying domestication and stress adaptation. While the introduction is well-structured, including additional background on key traits involved in the process of grape domestication beyond size and quality would help contextualize the study. Results Your data and figures comprehensively address the research question of the study. However, adding a legend to figure 1B would improve the readability of the bar charts. Also in figure 1, the principal component analysis plots clearly show a separation between cultivated and wild accessions, which is an important finding. Differential methylation analysis revealed almost 10,000 DMRs between wild and cultivated varieties of grapevine. However, the terms “DMR” and “DMC” were used interchangeably, which may be confusing to the reader. Figure 4 successfully demonstrates methylation distribution across different genomic regions. However, the reference to dividing methylation patterns into four groups while listing six may need clarification. Discussion Your discussion places the findings in a broader context and highlights key mechanisms by which DNA methylation contributes to domestication. The comparison to rice, where domestication led to decreased methylation, is particularly interesting. This comparison would be more compelling with additional discussion on epigenetic differences between other domesticated crops and their wild counterparts. Moreover, the potential functional significance of intergenic DMRs and their association with long intergenic non-coding RNAs is well-explained. However, the broader implications of these findings—such as their potential for crop improvement—could be further elaborated. Lastly, this study showed that methylation patterns are maintained when grapevine propagates are removed from the region they are cultivated in, suggesting that the epigenetic expression may be fixed and persist in subsequent generations. Suggestions While the study is strong overall, we have a few comments that may improve readability and emphasize the potential of this research. Provide clarifications for a couple inconsistencies, specifically the use of DMCs and DMRs interchangeably and referencing four methylation pattern groups when six are listed. Additional comparisons to methylation studies in other crops, if available. Further elaboration on the broader impacts of this research. Since DMRs were found between wild and cultivated grapevines, how can this information be used for crop improvement? Your study provides a valuable foundation for understanding the role of epigenetic regulation in crop domestication. Your findings are clear, well-supported, and offer novel insights into how DNA methylation shapes cultivated grapevines. We look forward to seeing how this research evolves and contributes to the broader field of plant epigenetics. Thank you for sharing your work with the scientific community.

The study reveals that these RNAi-mediated epimutations can be inherited across generations through a non-Mendelian pattern, providing insights into a novel mechanism of epigenetic inheritance in eukaryotes. Introduction: The introduction effectively sets the stage for the research by highlighting the pressing issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in fungal pathogens. The authors successfully articulate the need to understand the mechanisms behind antifungal resistance, particularly focusing on RNAi as a driver of epigenetic changes that can be inherited without altering the DNA sequence. Results: The results are compelling and largely supported by the figures presented. However, there are some concerns regarding data presentation. The extensive use of extended data makes it challenging to follow. For instance, in Figure 1, the total sRNA coverage is obscured by siRNA data, complicating interpretation. Additionally, certain resistant strains shown in Figure 2 are not adequately discussed in the text, which may lead to confusion for the reader. Figure 3b shows that siRNAs are present at the fkbA locus in resistant progeny, but there is no enrichment of H3K9me2. This suggests that RNAi is responsible for the epimutation, yet this critical point is not mentioned in the paper. Highlighting the regions where H3K9me2 is absent and siRNAs are present would improve clarity. The authors present a Chi-squared test to demonstrate non-Mendelian inheritance, but further statistical analysis, such as regression models, could enhance the robustness of their claims. Discussion: The discussion provides valuable insights into the implications of the findings for understanding RNA-based epigenetic inheritance. The authors effectively connect their results to previous research, demonstrating how RNAi-mediated antifungal resistance can be inherited through sexual reproduction. This novel finding contributes to the understanding of how fungi can develop reversible and heritable drug resistance without permanent genetic changes, potentially explaining the unpredictable nature of antifungal resistance in clinical settings. Suggestions: While the paper presents robust findings, there are areas for improvements: The authors should address the limitations of their study, particularly the focus on a single species of Mucor. Exploring RNAi-mediated epimutation inheritance in other fungal species – medically and agriculturally important fungal species – could strengthen the claims. A deeper investigation into the clinical implications of these epigenetic traits for treating fungal infections and combating fAMR would enhance the relevance of the research. Improving the clarity of data presentation in figures, ensuring that all relevant resistant strains are adequately discussed in the text and figures, would benefit the reader. Additionally, including more detailed strain-specific information and explicitly defining statistical thresholds would enhance reproducibility.",2025-05-07T00:38:22,disqus_zNEHHjaT83,Young Cho,10.1101/2024.10.15.618540,RNAi epimutations conferring antifungal drug resistance are inheritable,"Carlos Pérez-Arques, María Isabel Navarro-Mendoza, Ziyan Xu, Grit Walther, Joseph Heitman",2024-11-19

Introduction: The introduction provides a strong justification for the study, emphasizing the importance of heat  stress in poultry production and its transgenerational effects. It effectively introduces epigenetic  mechanisms as a means of adaptation, though it could benefit from a more concise background on  previous findings in avian species. Results: The findings are well-structured, detailing DNA methylation changes, gene expression analysis,  and functional enrichment of differentially methylated genes. The identification of ATP9A as a  potential key gene in heat stress adaptation is particularly interesting.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.11.623029v1#comment-6701013085,biorxivstage,0,"Summary This study presents compelling evidence that rapid protein evolution in essential cellular processes, such as telomere protection, can be accommodated through adaptive coevolution. Specifically, the authors show that HipHop and HOAP, two interacting proteins involved in telomere capping in Drosophila, coevolve to maintain telomere integrity despite sequence divergence. The work uses elegant CRISPR-based gene swaps, functional assays, and evolutionary analysis to demonstrate that compatibility between these proteins is critical for viability and proper chromosome end protection. Introduction The study addresses a fascinating paradox: how essential proteins evolve rapidly while maintaining function. The authors frame this question within the context of telomere biology and selfish genetic elements. Their focus on HipHop and HOAP as a coevolving pair allows them to explore this question at both functional and evolutionary levels. The rationale is clear and well-motivated. Results Genetic swaps between D. melanogaster and D. yakubausing CRISPR/Cas9 provide direct functional insights. The authors show that replacing D. melanogaster HipHop with the D. yakuba version leads to lethal telomere fusions, while restoring just six key amino acids or co-expressing the matching HOAP rescues viability. This is supported by viability and fertility assays, fluorescence imaging of telomere fusions, and dN/dS analysis across orthologs. Overall, the results convincingly support the conclusion that protein-protein coevolution preserves essential function. Discussion This paper goes beyond previous studies by providing direct in vivo experimental proof of adaptive coevolution in a multi-protein complex. It confirms earlier observations that telomere-binding proteins evolve rapidly under selection driven by selfish genetic elements. However, unlike many past studies that compared distantly related species, this work focuses on two closely related species, enhancing the resolution of the evolutionary and functional insights. The proposal of a maternal-effect hybrid incompatibility arising from telomere capping protein divergence is especially novel and intriguing. Suggestions Expanding the discussion on whether similar coevolutionary mechanisms might apply to other essential protein complexes under conflict-driven evolution.

Key Findings: The researchers conducted a comprehensive comparison of 16S rRNA gene-sequencing (metagenomics) and meta-transcriptomic (RNA-seq) analyses to profile the microbiota of the female reproductive tract (FRT). They revealed that the 16S rRNA sequencing effectively identified the bacterial taxa present; however, the authors did not account for the functional or metabolic activity of the bacteria. The meta-transcriptomic sequencing captured gene expression, identifying which microbes are transcriptionally active. This distinction is interesting, for it became clear that microbial communities inferred from DNA-based methods do not always reflect active nor beneficial contributors to the local ecosystem. The study found profound differences between the DNA and RNA profiles from the same samples, leading to significantly different conclusions to which microbes dominate the FRT environment. For example, the Lactobacillus species that are traditionally considered beneficial and dominant in healthy FRT were abundant in 16S profiles but exhibited low transcriptional activity in RNA-seq data. In contrast, the potentially pathogenic or dysbiosis-associated genera like Gardnerella and Prevotella were underrepresented in 16S data but demonstrated high transcriptional activity, especially in samples where DNA-based methods did not identify their presence as significant. These findings suggest that the mere presence of Lactobacillus may not be a reliable indicator of vaginal health unless the bacteria are also metabolically active. By exposing the divergence between microbial abundance and activity, the study challenges the assumption that taxonomic dominance equals functional influence, allowing the authors to propose that integrating both DNA and RNA-based molecular profiling is essential to an accurate understanding of the microbial dynamics in the FRT and to improve diagnostics and interventions for female reproductive health. 3. Results: - Figure 1 effectively supports the paper’s conclusion by demonstrating that integration of both methods of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and meta-transcriptomic analysis shows the different microbes in the female reproductive tract. This means this approach can detect both live and dead microbes. - Figure 2 shows the abundance of various microbes in the female reproductive tract from utilization of the dual approach and supports the dual method in significantly increasing or improving the detection of microbial composition. - Suggestions for the box plots are to add asterisks to visually see any significances and possibly only show the top 10 most abundance or significant genera to reduce clutter and highlight the meaningful results. - Figure 3 supports the conclusions by showing the microbial diversity in the endometrium by comparing it to the vagina based on the different sample types as well. The significance was shown by asterisks as well. - Figure 4 strongly supports the conclusion by effectively showing both DNA and RNA profiles across the samples, showing limitations of just depending on the RNA-based profiling alone, and the table also shows the support for the importance of quality interpretation of RNA-seq data as seen through the dramatic drops of number from human reads to microbial reads. - Suggestions include grouping or ordering samples on the x-axis by the sample type, so far it appears random. This would help make it easier to compare patterns. For human vs microbial reads, label clearly with commas or decimals. - Figure 5 effectively shows overlapping and unique genera, as well as emphasizing methods and tissue specific differences. They were able to show that the microbiome composition detected varied according to method and the type of sampling. - Figure 6 supports conclusions by showcasing the main genera varied by methods and emphasizing that the microbe activity does not necessarily equal abundance . Suggestions include adding significance asterisks to show the differences.\ - Figure 7 reinforces the conclusions of the paper by showing functional activity vs structural presence and that specific genera in the endometrium may be undermined by relying on DNA-based approaches alone. - Figure 8 strongly supports the conclusion that the 16S rRNA and meta-transcriptomic approaches result in different microbial profiles and that both approaches are essential to understand the endometrium microbiome. They directly compared DNA vs RNA endometrial biopsy samples. - Figure 9 is an excellent figure in illustrating the workflow and summary for characterizing the microbiome and microbiota in different samples types. It was clear on their methods, analyses, and objectives on what they wanted to look at. 4. Discussion: I liked that the beginning of the discussion section started off reiterating the importance of this study. One area that could have been improved was the first sentence. What diseases or medical conditions can 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the female reproductive microbiota help? Further into the discussion, I liked that the authors explained the importance of each experiment. For example, going into detail about why the Tao Brush and decontamination was a necessary step. Another area of improvement would be discussing the future directions with this novel concept. After these findings, how else can the authors use it to advance their understanding of the female microbiota? Other than that, I thought the discussion summarized the findings of the study well. 5. Methods: Overall, the methods were well-written with thorough explanations as to why each experiment was conducted and this section was nicely organized. There are some missing gaps of information that could be elaborated upon to make the paper more digestible. For example, the study cohort consisted of women aged from 27-42 years old. I think the authors could have done a better job at explaining how they were able to define the exclusion criteria for reproductive age range. I noticed that when I google “reproductive age range”, there are a variety of ranges and am curious as to why the authors chose this range. In addition, the study cohort consisted of 44 women and the validation cohort consisted of 5 women. Why is the validation cohort such a smaller number of women? Does this affect any statistical analysis? Another section that could be expanded upon is on page 27, where they discuss 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A bit more of an explanation as to why the V4 hypervariable region was amplified may be helpful. As for Figure 9, while the figure is relatively easy to follow along, I think there were other ways to display the workflow and could have helped the readers more. Other sections such as the DNA and RNA isolation and Bioinformatics methods were easy to follow along and understand. 6. Strengths and Limitations: One of the strengths of this study lies in its innovative side-by-side comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and meta-transcriptomic analysis applied to the same clinical samples from the female reproductive tract. This dual approach offers a more nuanced view of the microbiota by distinguishing between microbial presence and metabolic activity, an important distinction that previous studies relying solely on DNA-based techniques have overlooked. The authors implemented a rigorously controlled sample processing pipeline that included steps to minimize host RNA contamination, which increases the reliability of microbial transcript detection. The study is supported by robust bioinformatics workflows with clear visualizations like principal component analysis and taxonomic heatmaps that effectively illustrate the divergence between DNA and RNA-based microbial profiles. The findings have important implications for clinical diagnostics, for they suggest that relying solely on taxonomic abundance may be insufficient to assess microbial function or pathogenic potential in reproductive health contexts. There are a few limitations that constrain the broader applicability of the study’s conclusions. The relatively small sample size of only ten women limits the statistical power and restricts the generalizability of the results across diverse populations; moreover, the cross-sectional nature of the study means it captures a snapshot in time and cannot account for dynamic changes in the microbiome across different phases of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, or infection. While the detection of microbial transcripts adds a valuable functional layer, the study stops short of validating gene expression with proteomic or metabolomic data, leaving open questions about whether detected transcripts translate to actual protein production or metabolic impact. Also, the authors do not account for host physiological factors such as hormone levels, immune activity, or vaginal pH, which could influence microbial transcriptional activity. Addressing these variables in future studies would help refine interpretations and improve the clinical relevance of microbial activity profiles. 7. Editorial Decision: Overall, I think the paper is relatively well-written and breaks down each section in a digestible way. I am not often exposed to these types of research but I was able to follow along. There were some minor suggestions I have which just include adding more detail to help the reader understand more. The overall paper does an excellent job in presenting the results in a way that allows the reader to follow along and understand their methods and the why. They effectively showed the benefits and specificity of the dual method through comparison of certain methods alone to emphasize how significant their dual method approach is. The results show the significance of implementing a dual approach for the potential clinical use to impact gynecological disease Suggestions: ● Some results could be grouped together such as Figure 2 and 3. It would be neat to show together both the abundance of microbes in the female reproductive tract and the diversity of microbes. As well as combine figures 7 and 8, both figures go over the abundances of the most abundant microbes in endometrial brush vs endometrial biopsy samples and compare DNA vs RNA. Combining these figures together to make one figure would allow the reader to quickly see the pattern or any differences. ● In the methods section, there are a couple spelling/grammatical errors. On page 25, under the sample collection header, the word “gynaecologist” is spelled incorrectly. The proper spelling for this should be gynecologist. On page 26, “two additional aliquot were…”, it should be aliquots written plurally. Then, on page 27, the sentence reads “a double purification with magnetics beads…”, shouldn’t it be magnetic beads? ● In discussion, they can emphasize more on the interpretation on the discrepancies such as why is there a discordance between DNA and RNA. They could also dig deeper as to why the RNA-based analysis provided higher resolution in detecting certain pathogens, even in the endometrium. Some minor revisions should be considered to strengthen the manuscript and improve its clarity and reproducibility. First, we recommend expanding the discussion on the clinical relevance of microbial activity profiling. For example, how might the distinction between dormant and transcriptionally active bacteria influence treatment strategies for recurrent bacterial vaginosis or fertility assessments? Second, it would be helpful to include a brief statement on whether sequencing batch effects were assessed or controlled, especially since subtle technical variability can influence community composition in small-sample studies. Clarifying this will reinforce confidence in the strength of the researchers’ findings. Third, the methods section should provide more detail in regards to RNA integrity metrics, for RNA quality is critical in meta-transcriptomic studies where degradation can skew transcriptional profiles. The paper fills a methodological and conceptual gap in the field and provides a framework for future studies incorporating both taxonomic and functional dimensions of microbiome analysis.",2025-05-06T22:01:39,disqus_zNEHHjaT83,Young Cho,10.1101/2025.03.18.643876,Comprehensive 16S rRNA gene sequencing and meta-transcriptomic analyses in female reproductive tract microbiota: Two molecular profiles with different messages,"Alberto Sola-Leyva, Inmaculada Pérez-Prieto, Analuce Canha-Gouveia, Eduardo Salas-Espejo, Nerea M.

Of the ORs found, 38% are upregulated in the antenna compared to the hind legs, indicating these genes are still heavily used for olfaction. Of those genes there is one, OR6, that is upregulated in males compared to females. This gene is likely a pheromone receptor due to the fact that males express it at such high levels. Though the pheromone may be used only at close range for mating verification. The findings suggest that fireflies use multimodal signals during mating instead of solely relying on olfactory or visual signal. 3.Results (Mathew): Evaluate the figures and data presentation. Do they effectively support the paper’s conclusions? Why or why not? I feel that the figures and data support the paper well, especially figure 5 which shows a visual of the differential expression. Figure 2 is good, although a little hard to read, but that is a limitation with many phylogenies of genomic data. The table (figure1) that shows the number of ORs in different species also gives a good visual of the differences in beetle ORs. Showing that fireflies are quite different from EAB, despite being similar in relying heavily on visual cues and being closer related. The data can be difficult to interpret in genomic papers but the rest of the figures and the way the results are written help the reader parse out the significant parts. This makes the data easier to digest. 4.Discussion (Mathew): How do the results contribute to the broader context of previous research? What similarities or differences exist compared to prior studies? Their findings show that it is important to evaluate both full genomic data and RNA data, focusing on only one will leave you with a limited view, potentially misleading you in your conclusions. Comparing past genomic data from other beetles gives insight into the evolutionary history of this species. The new data will do the same for future studies as well. They have expanded the understanding of the mating behaviour of P. Pyralis, showing that while visual cues play a large role, olfaction is still used to some extent. The OR genome of P. Pyralis is larger than other beetles that rely on visual cues but only a portion are actually upregulated in the antenna. The rest are conserved for some reason but adults still rely on olfaction for a portion of mating. 5.Methods (Mathew): What techniques did the authors use, and why were these methods appropriate for this study? They first used a tblastn search to identify scaffolds with potential ORs using published P. Pyralis genome data. Then they manually annotated the ORs in genius prime using other known beetle ORs to run blast searches on each scaffold. They compared those ORs with known ORs and predicted the transmembrane domains of each one to verify they were ORs and support the annotations. They then constructed a phylogeny to compare the new ORs with closely related beetles. The second part of the study extracted RNA from the antenna and legs of P. Pyralis for sequencing. Using the sequenced RNA data they ran a differential expression analysis to see where the ORs were up or down regulated. They also compared the OR expression in males vs. females. They describe the use of flies after being captured in the wild but I’m not sure how the developmental stage of flies was confirmed and if all of them were already at the stage where the ORs are fully developed and expressed. (Rai) 6.Strengths and Limitations (Mathew): What are the key strengths of this paper? Are there any limitations or unanswered questions that should be addressed? Strengths: This paper does checks throughout the data collection to strengthen the validity of the results. They used both full genome and RNA data to examine both halves of the picture. This applies the genomic data immediately to discover deeper insight into the biology of P. Pyralis. They also had a large group of individuals that each worked on a portion to make sure their expertise was used to its full potential. This fills gaps in the study that one lab could not have done alone. Limitations: The ORs need further study to determine the true use of key genes, this will take another study and significantly more time. It also relies on the validity of past OR data, while the data seems very sound, if anything ever upended that data then the genomic portion of this data would also be upended, though this is highly unlikely. Another limitation is that this data can be hard for some to interpret, but I feel the authors handled the presentation of the data well and made it more accessible than many other papers. 7.Editorial Decision: If you were an editor for a top-tier journal, would you accept this paper as is, require major or minor revisions, or reject it? Justify your decision. If you suggest rejection, recommend a more suitable journal for submission. (Mathew) I would accept this paper, it is thorough and provides new insight into the biology of P. Pyralis. The methods are solid and contain continuous testing of the data to verify the validity of the study. They also apply the genomic data they found immediately to run the RNA analysis, this expands the impact of the study greatly. They have clearly self reviewed to refine the paper to the point it is at now. Suggestions: I don't have any really, I may be biased but I think it's a great paper.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.08.617286v5#comment-6701007642,biorxivstage,0,"Key findings The first primary discovery discussed in this paper is that age affects DNA methylation (DNAm) in different ways depending on the location in the genome. For example, the researchers found that promoter regions experienced hypermethylation with age, while transposable elements experienced hypomethylation. The second discovery was that female dogs had lower methylation in X chromosome-linked long interspersed nuclear element-1s (LINE1s) than male dogs. This was unexpected because X chromosome inactivation would normally lead to much higher methylation, and thus a possible explanation is that females are more susceptible to age-related decline in methylation than males. The third discovery is that size is largely associated with the rate of methylation decline, where larger dogs lose LINE1 methylation with age at a significantly higher rate than smaller dogs. This may be a large part of the reason why larger dogs tend to have shorter lifespans. Results Figure 1 shows how the researchers prepared, processed, and annotated the blood samples from 864 dogs in order to measure the DNAm at various CpG sites throughout their genome. Figure 2 shows how age affects DNAm at different locations in the dogs’ genomes. Figure 3 shows that X-linked and age-associated X-linked LINE1s are more methylated in male dogs compared to female dogs. Figure 4 plots LINE1 methylation against age, showing that large dogs lose LINE1 methylation faster and have shorter lifespans than small dogs. These figures effectively show each significant conclusion the researchers made. I liked that only the major figures were included in the main part of the paper, while other less important, supporting data was labeled as supplementary figures. Supplemental figure 1 shows that there was no significant difference in the sizes of the female and male dogs used in this study, and also that each dog was appropriately categorized by size so that there was minimal overlap. Supplemental figure 2 gives an overview of the CpG sites that were analyzed in this study, showing CpG densities, region lengths, mean methylation, and high sample coverage. Supplemental figure 3 shows that promoter regions that are affected by methylation as one ages are often associated with important biological functions, such as integrated stress response signaling, immune response, etc. Discussion The discussion clearly outlines the main findings of this study. The first of which, correlates age with methylation in the genome. Additionally the methylation of LINE1s, a class of autonomous transposable elements, had a lower frequency in females than males. Lastly, the rate of DNA methylation in LINE1 was also associated with dog size. These conclusions were also supported by previous studies in other model species. For instance, the loss of methylation of LINE1s in other mammals was also associated with age, an observation also made in dogs. Furthermore, the authors conveyed the importance of this study (i.e. the higher frequency of LINE1 methylation in males) through linking the loss of silencing in Y-linked LINE1s with shorter life span, as this was observed in human studies. Methods In the methods section, describing blood sample collection, mention of transporting blood samples between universities was included. However the temperature at which these samples were at during this time period was not recorded. Additionally the amount of sample taken was not mentioned. Rather, this section conveyed what cohort of dogs their samples were taken from, who isolated specific cells from the samples, and why these peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated. Additionally, the method to extract the peripheral blood mononuclear cells may be present in reference 115. At the time of writing this review, this reference could not be accessed. Sample annotation, describes how information about the dogs’ backgrounds were obtained, first through survey. Which was utilized to categorize the dogs by size. Following this, a machine learning model calculated adult dog heights from 0-4. Where 0 equated to ankle height and 4 was waist high. For this, it may be preferable to designate height values or ranges rather than descriptions, as these heights are subjective. However, utilizing calculated or predicted heights allowed several advantages compared to survey or self-reported data, which was also included. RRBS was used to identify CpG sites by converting unmethylated cytosines to uracils, which is highly appropriate for this study, because it allowed the researchers to find and analyze any age-related changes in methylation across their samples. These sites were grouped into 47,393 regions based on their distances from each other, such that CpG sites from the same region were no further than 250 bp apart. This was an important preprocessing step because CpG sites that are close to each other are likely to experience similar levels of methylation, and thus any sites located further could have negatively skewed their data. Furthermore, a large majority of CpG regions (80%) had greater than 5x coverage in more than 95% of samples, ensuring that the data they collected was consistent and therefore reliable. The researchers annotated their CpG regions by using previously made data as a reference. For instance, they used NIH CanFam4, which is the current reference genome for Canis lupus familiaris, to align their sequenced data with. They were also able to map chromatin states (e.g. active promoters, enhancers, heterochromatin, and inactive regions) using Son et al.’s epigenetic map. PQLSeq was used for region-based differential methylation analysis because, as RRBS provides methylation and total read counts for CpG sites, PQLSeq uses binomial proportions to model the methylation data as an age-related factor and account for fixed and random effects of sex, predicted height, and genetic relatedness. With a generally large sample size of 864 dogs, each with their own larger set of methylated regions, it was necessary to use the Sol Supercomputer in order to compile and process all of the data efficiently and accurately. Strengths and limitations This paper was enlightening. There was a clear reason as to why this research should continue as these results can shed light on epigenetic processes that occur as mammals age. The goal of this paper was also achieved, as the authors recorded that DNA methylation plays a role as dogs age, where specific DNA regions experience changes in methylation frequency. The methods utilized to obtain these results and the following data supported their conclusions. Wherein their discussion section, ample prior results in various model species supported their results. Furthermore, the authors stated some limitations in their study but were able to come to conclusions utilizing papers focusing on other species. Thus, analysis of their results were sufficient. However, there are areas for improvement. There are minor adjustments that may need to be considered before publishing, which were detailed in the editorial decision. Furthermore, in terms of the cohort utilized, the number of female to male subjects and breed sizes varied between these categories and was not addressed. Which may inspire the question of how many subjects would be considered sufficient for the conclusions made in this paper. Additionally, figure clarity can be improved, specifically for Figure 4. As in print, the color differentiating breed size are very similar, to increase visibility it may be preferable to utilize other colors or dotted/dashed lines. However, these are minor changes and inquiries that do not diminish the importance of this paper. Editorial decision There are some formatting issues. For instance, in the third paragraph of the discussion section in the fourth sentence, stating, “A genetic mechanism underlying this breed’s increased cancer risk. . .” between, “breed’s,” and, “increased,” is a double space. Additionally, in the third paragraph of the introduction section, DNA methylation’s acronym (DNAm) is defined for the second time, which can be omitted, as the acronym was fully spelled out in a previous paragraph. The references are not formatted using current APA format. Furthermore there are some inconsistencies with the addition of DOIs, as only a couple references have them. In references that name species, they are not italicized. Additionally reference 115, at the time of writing this review, was not accessible. More clarity would also be preferable regarding how 864 subjects were chosen out of the approximate 1,000 dogs enrolled in the cohort used. Furthermore, during sample annotation, height values categorized by a machine learning model were described rather than providing a range of measurements, as the descriptions were subjective (e.g. “ankle high”). Otherwise, the value of this study is clear and this project is certainly valuable to understanding the impact of methylation and aging in mammals. Overall, the paper was a great read. This paper was organized into sections in a way that made it very easy to follow. We especially liked that major conclusion statements were bolded and made as subheadings in the discussion section, and that only figures that directly supported those conclusions were included in the main part of the paper. One other minor thing that we would say could be improved upon is the golden retriever case study — in order to show that age-related methylation patterns affect dogs on a breed-specific level, we feel like it would have been interesting to see the comparison of methylation in golden retrievers to distinct breeds rather than just non-golden retrievers.

I understand that in this work, the authors sequenced large genomes, so it requires PromethION. If working with smaller genome-size sample (e.g. shrimp), does MinION work as well (since MinION is more cost-effective for majority of labs). Also, from the Table 1, it looked like more parameters are better when using trio than Pore-C. Therefore, I was wondering if Pore-C is a good choice over trio in this case? Introduction - Authors stated that Pacbio HiFi provides 99.5% accuracy and Oxford nanopore (ONT) for ultra long reads gives 95% accuracy. To my knowledge, ONT provides higher accuracy rate than this number. Therefore, it could be better if you could provide references for these information. Results - Figures and captions: figure resolution was not great Discussion - Authors mentioned that there is a large variability in yields over times due to pre-released versions of Duplex sequencing.

The paper highlighted key findings including being one of the first articles to produce methylation data from the retina. With this data they were able to use methods like GWAS, deep neural networks, and CRISPR experiments on mice. Ultimately, despite the small sample size I think this article sheds light on an important topic or retina diseases and those related to age. Introduction: The introduction section of this article was able to provide necessary details on the retina and the specific diseases that affect this type of tissue including the implications of age on the retina as well. Additionally, this section provided the paper with a good foundation of the overall research project and introduced the objectives and a brief overview of the techniques used. Results: The result section of this paper were useful in solidifying the conclusions made. It was apparent that with the many figures provided, that the researchers were confident in their results. One figure in particular was very interesting, the spatial imagery of the retina tissues were of interest as this is likely on of the first spatial images of the retina tissues. Other figures including the CRISPR analysis and the deep neural network predictions provided very helpful results in supporting their conclusions. Ultimately, the researchers were able to highlight the SNPs associated with particular genes that affect or may be causal to retinal diseases. Discussion: The discussion section of this paper was helpful in connecting the findings of their experiments to the implications of retina diseases. It was most interesting to see how the authors used methylation data to truly identify specific SNPs related to genes involved. The discussion also mentions the one major limitation of the study which is the very limited sample size. The authors mentioned only having 3 donors available to give retina tissues post-mortem. Understandably, the process of getting high-quality retina tissues is an incredibly difficult task. However this does affect the possibility for generalizable results. This is particularly damaging to the strength of this paper as this was one the main objectives of the project. Ultimately, the paper does well in describing the importance of their findings but falls short in showing how their findings could be applicable to the general public. Suggestions: The main suggestion proposed to this article would be to have some way of improving the sample size completely. Although difficult, this will drastically improve the statistical power of the study and provide a broader analysis of the population. Additionally, it may be useful to provide some comparison to other studies related to retina diseases as this could help support the findings in this paper. Ultimately, this article was very interesting to read and could benefit from these suggestions to make it even better.",2025-05-06T21:51:26,disqus_zNEHHjaT83,Young Cho,10.1101/2024.12.28.630634,Single-cell analysis of the epigenome and 3D chromatin architecture in the human retina,"Ying Yuan, Pooja Biswas, Nathan R.

Please allow me to share a few thoughts and reflections as a fellow researcher interested in genome architecture and neurodegenerative disease. Summary Your study represents an exciting and novel application of long-read nanopore sequencing to uncover large-scale structural variations (SVs) and retrotransposon dynamics in postmortem AD brain tissue. The integration of locus-specific methylation analysis adds a valuable layer of epigenetic insight, offering a fresh perspective on the genomic instability that may underlie Alzheimer’s disease. Introduction The introduction effectively outlines the limitations of short-read sequencing in detecting SVs and frames the rationale for using nanopore technology clearly. I appreciated the way you contextualized your work within broader efforts to understand somatic mosaicism in neurodegeneration. It set the stage for a study that delivers on its promise. Results The clarity of the figures and analysis stood out, particularly: Figure 1’s workflow, which provides a strong foundation for readers less familiar with long-read pipelines. The findings in Figure 2, which convincingly demonstrate the added value of nanopore sequencing in detecting larger and more complex SVs. Figure 4 was particularly compelling, offering Braak stage-specific methylation patterns in retrotransposons, which would likely be overlooked in bulk analysis. Your evolutionary stratification of transposable elements adds meaningful nuance. It was also notable that many of the identified SVs intersect with genes implicated in neuronal function and inflammation—further supporting their relevance to AD pathology. Discussion Your discussion provides thoughtful consideration of both the strengths and limitations of your study. I appreciated your candid acknowledgment of sample size constraints and the lack of functional validation at this stage. The framing of this work as a springboard for future mechanistic studies was well-positioned. One area that could be expanded is the potential mechanism behind LINE-1 reactivation in the AD brain. A brief exploration of possible epigenetic or inflammatory triggers could enrich the interpretation of your methylation findings and open additional paths for hypothesis generation. Suggestions Consider including a more detailed explanation of why LINE-1 elements may become reactivated in AD, whether through inflammatory signaling, heterochromatin loss, or oxidative stress. If possible in future work, validation using transcriptional data or orthogonal molecular techniques (e.g., PCR, RNA-seq) would help clarify the biological impact of the detected SVs. Adding brief demographic or neuropathological details about control samples could improve clarity regarding your comparative analyses. Again, congratulations on this impressive and thought-provoking manuscript. It was a pleasure to read, and I look forward to seeing how this work evolves.

They identified 50,828 age-related differentially methylated CpG sites (dmCpGs) and found that hypermethylation was prominent in promoter-associated CpG islands. Promoter associated dmCpGs in CpG islands were underrepresented compared to CpGs in the whole genome. They also found that resistance training rejuvenated the aged methylome. After 12 weeks of resistance training, 73% of age-related dmCpGs in older men were no longer significantly different from young muscle. A cluster analysis showed that older post-training muscle samples resembled young baseline samples. It was also found that recurrent resistance training enhanced epigenetic and transcriptional responses. Retraining induced more hypomethylation and gene upregulation in comparison to the initial training in both young and older muscles. There was also evidence of epigenetic memory which was shown in the AMOTL1 in young muscle and VCL in older muscle. There was also a pathway analysis of focal adhesion and MAPK signaling which related to aging and training related adaptations. 3.Results: Evaluate the figures and data presentation. Do they effectively support the paper’s conclusions? Why or why not? Figure 1 was useful in explaining the experimental design of the study and giving a visual to help readers see the layout of the training program. Figure 1 was a very simple diagram that is useful to an introductory explanation of the study. Figure 2 had multiple parts and displayed the number of differentially methylated CpGs and differentially expressed genes across different points of the training program. Looking at figure 2, it can be found that there was an increased response during retraining and the reversal of changes during detraining. While figure 2 is useful in describing the results, we feel as if they could be more spread out instead of being grouped together. Table 1 was useful in seeing the top 3 enriched pathways per analysis and beneficial for comparison of data. For figure 3, it was also very cluttered and similar to figure 2. We feel that these could be better spread throughout the paper. Figure 4 was nice because it displayed differential expression between young and older muscle and different dmCpG sites. Figure 5 used a heat map of normalized B-values of CpGs that had significantly different methylation levels between young and older men at baseline. Figure 6 was also similar to figures 2 and 3 where it had multiple parts. These can make it more difficult for readers to follow along. Figure 7 shows another version of overlapping the genes following the different training phases. We feel as if this is similar to the ones shown in figure 2 and 3 with the exception that it adds the AMOTL1 and VCL being indicative for an epi-memory. Figure 2b and 6b both showed the distribution of differentially methylated CpGs across gene regions and structures which make it repetitive. Overall, the figures effectively supported the paper’s conclusions although it felt like there were too many figures. Also, the figures could have been spread out more throughout the paper instead of compiling them together frequently. 4.Discussion: How do the results contribute to the broader context of previous research? What similarities or differences exist compared to prior studies? The results of this study contribute to a broader context of research on skeletal muscle plasticity, aging, and exercise. Previous studies have established that both the transcriptome and methylome of skeletal muscle are influenced by physical activity. This study expands on this by demonstrating that recurrent resistance training, also known as retraining, not only enhances but rejuvenates the muscle transcriptome and methylome, bringing older individuals' molecular profiles closer to those of younger individuals. Then there is the “muscle memory” effect in which prior training experience leaves a lasting molecular signature (especially in DNA methylation), which allows for a more robust and faster response upon retraining. This supports and builds on previous findings that suggested retained epigenetic marks could facilitate adaptation to subsequent training. When compared to prior work that focused more on the acute effects of exercise or single bouts of training, this work shows that longitudinal and repeated training interventions have extreme benefits, especially at the molecular level. 5.Methods: What techniques did the authors use, and why were these methods appropriate for this study? The authors used a combination of resistance training interventions, muscle biopsies, and multi-omics analyses to investigate how training, detraining, and retraining affect the skeletal muscle of young and older men at both the transcriptomic and epigenetic levels. Some key techniques they used: Resistance training -	The participants underwent a 12-week resistance training program, which was followed by 2 weeks of detraining and then another 12 weeks of retraining. They employed a longitudinal design which allowed the researcher to track the molecular changes over time and assess the effects of both initial and repeated training. Muscle biopsies The research took muscle samples from the vastus lateralis (quads) at key time points, these timpoints were pre-training, post-training, post-detraining, and post-retraining. These samples were important for downstream molecular analysis. Read next -> RNA Sequencing -	Gene expression changes DNA Methylation profiling - EPIC Beadchip Array -	DNA from muscle tissue was assessed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. This measures methylation at over 850,000 CpG sites. This allowed the researchers to quantify epigenetic modifications and how they are influenced by training phases. Statistical Analysis -	Principal Component Analysis (PCA), differential expression/methylation analysis, and pathway enrichment tools were used to interpret changes across time and between age groups. Important for handling large-scale data and showing biological patterns. 6.Strengths and Limitations: What are the key strengths of this paper? Are there any limitations or unanswered questions that should be addressed? This paper has a multitude of strengths, one being the use of a longitudinal study design, by utilizing this type of study including the training, detraining, and retraining phases, provides a realistic and dynamic view of how the skeletal muscle responds over time. This is important for understanding muscle memory. Another strength was how the researchers used both young and older participants which allowed for direct comparisons of age-related molecular plasticity and also how training can potentially “rejuvenate” older muscle. The use of a multi-omics approach by combining RNA sequencing with DNA methylation was another strength as it gave a comprehensive molecular picture which allows for the linkage of gene expression changes with underlying epigenetic modification. Lastly, the collection of muscle biopsies at multiple time points strengthened the interpretation of training effects and validated their findings. With strengths come limitations, one being that only Male participants were used. This leads to the findings not being very applicable to women, as they exhibit different hormonal and molecular responses to training. For future studies, they could have female participants. Another limitation is the small sample size, which can limit statistical power and generalizability. The study could have also benefited from more detailed physiological measures, such as strength gains, muscle hypertrophy, etc, to correlate molecular changes with functional outcomes. They also only took biopsies from the vastus lateralis which is part of the quadriceps, the lower body. They could’ve taken biopsies from other parts of the body in the upper extremities, such as the biceps brachii or latissimus dorsi as these are largely used muscles and some of the strongest for males in general. Lastly, the detraining period was quite short, only two weeks. These two weeks don’t fully represent the longer breaks from exercise that some may take due to injuries, illnesses, etc. This results in the extent of “memory” from a longer gap being relatively unknown. 7.Editorial Decision: If you were an editor for a top-tier journal, would you accept this paper as is, require major or minor revisions, or reject it? Justify your decision. If you suggest rejection, recommend a more suitable journal for submission. This study addresses an important question on whether prior exercise training leaves an epigenetic “memory” that can enhance future responses, especially in older aging muscle. The researchers had some great findings that have strong implications for aging, rehabilitation, and exercise medicine. With that being said, I would accept this paper, but first, I would suggest some minor revisions. Once being that the authors expand on functional interpretation, the molecular data is strong, but they could build more on the physiological outcomes like strength/hypertrophy, which would better support the significance of molecular changes. The bias of using only male subjects and the short detraining period should also be discussed and expanded upon as they are some of the major limitations in my opinion on this study. While I understand this paper was written by scientists, they should be getting input from actual athletes and using that information to work on their protocols. The study group was also very small which would not be very representative of athletes as a whole. A suggestion could be to repeat this study with a larger group and including female athletes in this study. Our group also found that the figures in this study were partially repetitive and cluttered. Reduction of figures could be considered or attempting to spread them out more throughout the paper so that readers can better follow along with the results.",2025-05-06T21:38:24,disqus_zNEHHjaT83,Young Cho,10.1101/2020.06.30.179465,Recurrent training rejuvenates and enhances transcriptome and methylome responses in young and older human muscle,"Sara Blocquiaux, Monique Ramaekers, Ruud Van Thienen, Henri Nielens, Christophe Delecluse, Katrien De Bock, Martine Thomis",2020-07-02

This study revealed that LptM has an essential region (C20GLKGPLYF28) within its N-terminal domain that interacts with LptD, although possibly slightly longer as discussed below. Consistent with the resolved cryoEM structure of EcLptD/E/M, in vivo disulfide crosslinking experiments revealed that LptM residue F28 is involved in the interaction with the LptD barrel domain. Additionally, residue G21 was shown to be critical for the function of LptM in the maturation of LptD. Also, the authors revealed the timing at which LptM interacts with LptD, showing that it acts at the late maturation step of LptD, after the action of BepA. The manuscript is well-written, and the conclusions made are supported by the data presented. We provide major and minor comments to help clarify some of the data and interpretations made. Major comments - Figure 1C. Could you explain why erythromycin sensitivity increased in the ΔbepA strain, while it resembled that of WT in the ΔlptM strain? Does it mean that maintaining a well-folded β-barrel domain is sufficient to maintain OM integrity? This is beyond the scope of this study, but do you think that would also be the case in ΔdsbA strain? - Figure 1E-F. Narita et al., 2016 concluded that BepA might play a role in facilitating the interaction of LptD and LptE at the BAM complex. This conclusion was based on the observed suppression of erythromycin sensitivity when overexpressing lptE in a ΔbepA strain which you also observed. Consider including this hypothesis as part of the discussion. - Figure 2B. Could you explain the accumulation of LptDC in K33amb and A35amb strains? Could it mean that LptM becomes less stable, or are these residues essential for LptM function? Lines 174-183 and lines 248-250: The interpretation that LptM in the cryoEM model stabilizes the folding of LptD due to the observed tight closure of the β-barrel junction is not fully convincing. It was based on comparisons made with the crystal structure of S. flexneri and an Alpha-fold model. Would it be possible to perform the comparison with a cryoEM structure of EcLptD/E without LptM instead, to see whether the junction is tightly closed in the absence of LptM or not? Or maybe do the comparison with the solved crystal structure (only β-barrel domain) of E. coli (PDB ID: 4RHB)? - Figure 4B. Consider showing the +ME lane between 15 and 20 KDa with αFLAG antibody to control that LptM is present. Minor comments - Introduction (Lines 80-88): Could you add to the LptM paragraph that it interacts with the LptD/E translocon by mimicking LPS binding? - Figure S4A (middle). The crystal structure presented (PDB ID: 4q35) is for Shigella flexneri and not E. coli. - Lines 176-177: The crystal structure solved in Qiao et al., 2014 is for Shigella flexneri and not E. coli. - Figure 5 and Lines 208-209: Could you clarify why alanine, cysteine and tryptophan were chosen for the mutagenesis experiment? Is it because they represent a non-polar (small), polar and non-polar (bulky) amino acids, respectively? Also, the data shows that only when G21 was mutated to Trp (and not to Ala or Cys), was the LptM activity affected. Could you explain why? And whether it has to do with steric hinderance or that the bulkiness of Trp obscures an essential interaction between other two amino acid residues? Could you show with what residues of the β-barrel domain G21 interacts in the cryoEM structure? Also, could you show an alignment of the conserved region with LptM homologs in the Enterobacteriaceae family and show whether G21 is conserved? - Lines 243-245: “Considering that this short essential region tightly interacts with the β-barrel domain of LptD (Figure 3, 4), it is unlikely to serve as a recruiter for the disulfide oxidase DsbA or disulfide isomerase DsbC to the LptD intermediate”, Could you explain why being in tight interaction with the β-barrel domain rules out the possibility that LptM recruits either DsbA or DsbC? Also, could you re-type “Considering that this short essential region....” to “considering the short essential region of LptM ....”, because it is not clear to the reader if you were referring to LptM. - Section 5 (Lines 218-250): Since this section describes the model, could you make the model a main figure instead of a supporting figure? - Lines 261-263: Could you remove “consisting almost entirely of signal sequences”, because, for example, LptM is not made entirely from a signal sequence or clarify that you are referring to the secreted proteins.

By comparing healthy controls and cerebellar ataxia patients in a visual tracking task with perturbations, the authors observed that both control pathways are preserved in patients, but that delays are higher for patients in both feedforward and feedback control loops. Additionally, patients exhibited a reduced feedback gain, which the authors interpret as a compensation strategy applied by patients to respond to the temporal incoordination between feedforward and feedback pathways rather than a consequence of the cerebellar damage itself. Finally, the authors demonstrate that the intact feedforward control mechanism can be leveraged in patients to improve tracking performance by presenting a 500ms preview of the future target trajectory. Although patients overall exhibited smaller performance improvements in the preview condition compared to controls, the authors suggest that the significant improvements seen in patients demonstrate that visual preview may serve as a direction for future therapeutic approaches to alleviate motor coordination problems in cerebellar ataxia patients. #Major comments: - Page 4/Figure 2C: At the bottom of page 4 you cite that the mean (or is it the median?) feedforward time delay was 245ms in the patient group. This does not line up with the mean shown by the two error bars in figure 2C. Could you please check if this is a typo or if not mention which moments are described in the text and the figure (mean/median)? The same question applies to the value 144ms (patients) cited for the feedback pathway on page 6. - Page 10 (Section “Target preview improves …”): As shown in figure 5E you mention that there was no significant relationship between ataxia score and error reduction. Based on this non-significant result you suggest that path preview leads to performance improvements independent of ataxia severity. However, have you considered if the absence of significance here might be because of the relatively small sample size of 17 patients? You could consider performing a Bayesian analysis to provide evidence for the absence of an effect? Or maybe have you tried performing a median split of the patient data and compare the means for patients with a high vs. low score? I am asking because figure 5E gives the impression that there is at least a linear trend between error reduction and ataxia score. - Page 12 (end of paragraph): how did you conclude that the improvements in smoothness and phase lead where stronger for the control group compared to the patient group? Did you perform a quantitative analysis of the data presented in figure 6D? - Page 18, Table 1: please provide a more detailed description of the different diagnoses of your patient group. Do you have any information about the approximate onset of symptoms (age at onset) in these patients? - Page 21 & Figure 10: You mention that you compared “various” model candidates for the transfer functions of the feedback and feedforward pathways but in figure 10 you only mention the top two candidates for each pathway. Could you provide more details about the different models that were compared and how you selected which possible transfer functions could describe the feedforward and the feedback controller? - Page 24/section 5.6: Could you please provide more details about your statistical analyses. For example, did you test if the assumptions for ANOVA and t-test were satisfied? Which correction method did you apply to compute the degrees of freedom for your unpaired t-tests (DoF are decimal numbers here)? Could you provide F-values, p-values, and effect size measures for all the ANOVA results (for some analyses you only mention p-values)? #Minor comments: - Figure 1D: how does the phase in the lower panel relate to average in figure 2B? Specifically, the range of phase shifts are very different in these two figures and I don’t understand why from the text. Why is there a phase lead shown in figure 1D, while there is a phase lag in figure 2B? Why does the gain increase in figure 1D and decrease in figure 2B? Please explain Figure 1C/D better in the text. - Page 4, 7th line from the bottom: You refer to figure 2B but it should be 2C - Figure 5 B/C: x-labels are missing - Figure 6A/B: For clarity maybe rename the y-axis labels to gain ratio and phase ratio? - Figure 8: Could you please specify somewhere in your methods what the total duration of one trial was? This was not clear to me from the various figures in the method and result sections. - Page 21/22 (section 5.4) and page 29 (section 6.1): Could you please improve the consistency in your notation of the transfer functions? Specifically, in the method section you use jω to denote the Fourier transform but in figure 10A you use s. Further, you use sometimes k, sometimes a, and sometimes b to refer to the gain and the pole of the filters. - This might be field/journal specific, but I would find it easier to follow as a reader if the statistical results would be added to the main text of the results instead of the figure legends",2025-04-28T09:52:40,disqus_giWenCsTY7,Anne Hoffmann,10.1101/2025.02.09.637327,Feedback and feedforward control are differentially delayed in cerebellar ataxia,"Di Cao, Michael G.T.

Through live imaging in zebrafish explants, the study shows that microtubules originating from a perinuclear microtubule organizing center (MTOC) guide the extension of dendrites for effective debris engulfment and enable precise migration toward tissue damage. When microtubules are disrupted, Langerhans cells become less efficient at phagocytosis and lose directional control during migration. These defects are linked to altered actin cytoskeleton polarity through the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway. The findings highlight how microtubule-dependent cell polarity enables immune cells to respond effectively within complex epithelial microenvironments. We found this study to be well-written and containing high-quality data that advances the fields of microtubule and immune cell biology. Overall, the data presented in this manuscript are done well and support the claims made by the authors. We outline some major and minor adjustments aimed at aiding the clarity of reporting and presentation. Major comments Page 10, Lines 286-289: We felt it was somewhat unsupported that F-actin accumulation in the trailing half of the cell was “consistent with the idea depolymerizing microtubules increases RhoA activity at the rear of the cell.” While the data clearly show a disruption in F-actin distribution with nocodazole treatment, we felt it was not clear that this would increase F-actin in the trailing half rather than evenly throughout the cell. Our lack of expertise in the field may lead to our misinterpretation of this sentence, however we felt additional explanation is needed (e.g. on the Lifeact-mRuby reporter) to clarify the section and support the conclusions drawn. Consider including a schematic of the model to ease interpretation of the data shown in Figure 4. Minor comments Page 2: It may be more effective to explicitly introduce RhoA/ROCK in the introduction rather than first mentioning it on page 10. This could connect your ideas more thoroughly, even if it’s just a brief mention in the introduction. Page 3, Line 102: You mention that the mpeg1.1 promoter labels multiple macrophage populations. Is there a concern that you’re labeling more than Langerhans cells in the epidermis, and that cells could be confused due to their altered morphology during the treatment? Page 3: The writing may be clearer if all acronyms (i.e. EMTB as ensconsin microtubule binding domain, EB3 as end-binding 3) are defined at their first use. Figure 1D: We found this panel somewhat difficult to interpret. Consider showing this panel in two dimensions displaying the percentage of EMTB+ dendrites as a function of the number of dendrites per cell. Figure 1K: It appears that the nocodazole treatment has one outlier (value of 100 µm). Does removing this datapoint change the significance of the treatment on maximum dendrite length? Figure 2E: It was unclear how the distance between the MTOC and phagosome was determined, i.e. whether the phagosome was measured from the point most distal or proximal to the cell body. Figure 2J: We thought your data would be most effective if you showed both the number and percentage of engulfment events for both control and nocodazole-treated cells to demonstrate how many events happened under each condition. Figure 3B: It appears that there are fewer Langerhans cells present in nocodazole-treated samples. Is this a significant impact or just coincidence in the images shown? Furthermore, could off-target effects or toxicity be impacting the migration differences seen here? Page 10, Line 263-264: There may be a typo here, where it‘s omitted that the “Langerhans cells had a smaller meandering index” were nocodazole-treated. Figure 4: A quantification of RhoA activation, e.g., using immunoblot, would be stronger evidence to support the conclusion that disruption of microtubules alters actin polarity through the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. This may be technically challenging: can one compare pulled-down microtubules to quantify RhoA binding between treated and non-treated? Figure 5: We’re interested to see if nocodazole-treated Langerhans cells would respond similarly to vehicle-treated (5C) or paclitaxel-treated (5D-E), especially considering the impacts of nocodazole on dendrite morphology (decreased cell dendrite number with increased length) you showed in Fig. 1G and Supplemental Video 3. We don't think this is a necessary experiment but may be worth including to provide alternative evidence of the impact of microtubule alteration on cell migration. We also found the placement of Figure 4 to disrupt the line of thinking connecting Figure 3 and 5. Consider moving Figure 5 after Figure 3 for logical flow, as Figure 4 is more mechanistic and addressing the question of the role actin plays in this process. Page 14, Line 385: It seems there may be a typo here, where “n=128 cells counted from N=13 scales” should include that these are in paclitaxel conditions. Page 14, Line 395: You mention that “acute chemical perturbations” were used in this paper. We thought that the laser ablation and/or scratch injury assays may be more accurately described as a physical or mechanical perturbation rather than chemical, but this may be from a lack of familiarity with writing conventions within the field. Page 15: In the second paragraph under “Cell motility,” there’s no name given for the image processing software used, which we think it would be helpful to include. Methods, Line 522: Could you write the exact percentage of DMSO used for the vehicle controls either here or directly in the figure legends. Supplemental Videos: We found your supplemental videos extremely informative. Would it be possible to include these in the main text?

Psilocybin rescues sociability deficits in an animal model of autism. Preprint at doi:10.1101/2020.09.09.289348 (2020); Song, C. et al, Lasting effect of psilocybin on sociability can be blocked by DNA methyltransferase inhibition. Preprint at doi: 2025.03.10.642385). Our studies in fact described that psilocybin increased sociability in animal models of autism and noted the absence of such effects in control (normal) mice. We therefore respectfully point out that the citation of Mollinedo-Gajate et al (2020) appears misleading here when cited as to support simply the statement “Psychedelics have been reported to influence social interactions” without specifying context of our studies’ s conclusion (namely, psilocybin rescues a deficit and does not rebalance what is in balance). The implication of questioning the therapeutic efficacy of psilocybin in neuropsychiatric conditions - built on observations in the absence of such conditions to begin with - would be misleading and illogical. We hope the authors may consider this feedback during the revision of the text, and together we may facilitate the generation of not only replicable and reliable results but also meaningful implications to constructively progress the field as a whole.

There are major problems with Enformer's pre-computed variant effect scores. The main summary is that in Enformer's precomputed scores they estimate the variant effect by comparing the allelic differences in total signal of predicted profiles of ~100 Kb length. So the effect of variants is greatly dampened. If u estimate the local effect size i.e the allelic effect of signal over 1Kb around the variant, you get much better predictions.

The authors found that wild type Arabidopsis root hair cells feature high levels of autophagy, measured by the presence of autophagic bodies while mutants in autophagy genes (ATG2, ATG5, and ATG7) show diminished levels of autophagic bodies. The root hairs of these autophagy mutants deteriorate at earlier time points than those of wild type seedlings, while displaying markers of developmental programmed cell death which are not found in young wild type root hair cells. They also found that, unlike similar phenotypes in other tissues, the premature degradation of root hair cells is not dependent on salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, or ethylene signaling, as double mutants in these pathways still presented early root hair collapse. Finally, they examined triple mutants in ATG2 and programmed cell death transcription factors ANAC046 and ANAC087 and found that mutations in these genes suppressed the early root hair cell death phenotype. This study reports interesting results that advance the field of developmental biology in roots with elegant single-cell resolution, we provide below some suggestions to increase the reproducibility of the work and clarity for a broader audience. Major comments - In the Introduction, there could be more elaboration on what the functions of the chosen autophagy genes are, as well as if there is any redundancy between them. In the text of the Results or the Methods section, an explanation of the types of mutations of each atg mutant would be helpful, as well as a justification for using a specific atg mutant in one experiment but not others (atg7 in Fig2A, and atg5 or atg2 throughout), using ATG8a as the autophagy reporter (Fig1) and using mutant atg7-2 with the H2A-GFP reporter, while the TOIM reporter was used for the other atg mutants (Fig2D, E). - In the text of the Results or the Methods section, more detail of how the confocal images were taken would be required for reproducibility, such as contrast settings, how software (ex: Fiji) was used, camera type. - To strengthen the conclusion that ATG5 expression in the xylem does not complement, although probably technically challenging, consider including evidence that it is expressed. - The Discussion section could benefit from a deeper discussion of the results that were obtained e.g. are there other mutations that cause a root-hair less phenotype? If so, what is the phenotype of such mutants? What happens if you grow the plants longer, would an atg mutant eventually have more root hairs? It would also be interesting to include your thoughts on some of the mechanisms behind the antagonistic relationship of autophagy and programmed cell death, could there be a direct interaction between a given ATG and ANAC046 and/or 087? A discussion of the possible redundancy between ANAC046 and 087 would be of interest. Would the single mutation of either in the atg2 background not rescue the premature root hair cell death? In Figure 4F, the ANAC046 line L7 has a few root hair tips remaining at the root junction, compared to line L4, which seems to have no root hairs. Could this be due to variable level of expression under the pE7 promoter? Minor comments - dPCD and ePCD are described in the introduction, and the meanings can be inferred, but it might be clearer to explain those abbreviations outright. - Supplemental Figure 2A, dotted line in atg5-1 image is not explained, so it is not clear if it is the same as the dotted line in earlier figures (which outline the root profile). - Figure 2 heading, “The loss function of autophagy...” should read “The loss of function.” - At the end of the results section “... the premature dPCD of root hairs in atg mutants dependents on canonical” should read depends. - Supplementary Figure 1H is missing a caption. It seems that the caption for Figure 1G may have been intended to address both figure panels from its description. - To fully validate the new atg2-8 and atg2-9 mutants, consider including ATG2 RNA or protein expression compared to atg2-2. - Define what the TOIM reporter is and what the acronym stands for. - Fig1A, B, C: Each of the representative confocal images has a right-hand panel showing a merged image, but their purpose is not fully clear. An explanation in the figure legend would be helpful for clarity. The cytosolic level of fluorescence makes it difficult to distinguish the difference between autophagic bodies and background fluorescence, consider including the details of image acquisition in this case to ensure the comparison between WT and mutants is suitable. - Figure 1E: Longitudinal is spelt wrong. - Figure 1E: In the figure caption atg7-2 and atg5-1 are mentioned but not shown. - Figure 3B: The figure is cut off and is written as “mCher”. Figure 2A, 3D, 3G, 3H, and 4F: The scale bars were also cut off (or are lacking). - Could you explain the nomenclature pPASPA3>>H2A-GFP reporter name written with the “>>” symbol instead of a colon. - In Figure 3B and 3F, the y-axis shows the number of cells expressing pPASPA3. It is not entirely clear in the text how this was counted: was this done using the H2A-GFP reporter? - In Figure 3F, the line L1 appears to have a slightly lower number of cells expressing pPASPA3. Are there any possible reasons for this (such as differences in Cas9 targeting in different lines)? - Statistical analyses: consider including an explanation for using t-test or ANOVA. - The cross section of the root seen in Figure 3 could be helpful in Figure 1, since Figure 1E features a cross section confocal as part of the ConA imaging and/or include a symbol to indicate orientation on both the transverse and longitudinal section views.

It is named « the felid from Iron Age Entzheim, France ». Apart from the absence of any citation of the analysis of this specimen that needs to be introduced, there are several scientific problems in the way it is used: 1.	It is not clear which specimen was used in this analysis. No measurements are indicated in tables S3 and S4 and the specimen is used in Fig. S2 simply named « the felid from Iron Age Entzheim, France », but there are two mandibles that I analyzed: one comes from site 4752 Entzheim-Geispolsheim ""Aéroparc-Lidl"" excavated in 2006 and the other from site 5046 Entzheim-Geispolsheim ""Lotissement d’activités Entzheim 4"" excavated in 2008. As the authors of the present study did not contact me, they did not have my measurements. Therefore, it is not clear how the indicated measurements were taken and on which specimen. 2.	In legend of Fig. S2 « A) Mandible and B) cheektooth row lengths (P4 - M1) (numbers upper case) » are problematic. First, as it is a mandible, these measurements should be indicated as (P4 - M1) (i.e., numbers as lower case) and not as (P4 - M1) (numbers as upper case). Second, it is unclear why the authors measured (P4 - M1) and not (P3 – M1), as they did in table S4 and for the axis of Fig. S2B. Finally, the length (P3 – M1) is shown as to be ~24,5mm, while the measurements of this trait I took on the complete mandibles before sampling for the paleogenetic study (published in 2017) are very different. Therefore, these various issues must be corrected.",2025-04-17T11:02:02,evamariageigl,Eva-Maria Geigl,10.1101/2025.03.28.645877,"Redefining the timing and circumstances of cat domestication, their dispersal trajectories, and the extirpation of European wildcats","Sean Doherty, Magdalena Krajcarz, Alberto Carmagnini, Evangelos Dimopoulos, Alexandra Jamieson, Joel M.

The paper tantalizingly mentions more detailed images of the structure in supplemental figures, but they are not included in the PDF and do not seem to be available for download. Will they be posted soon? Also, is there any chance your Alphafold models (and manual extension of the model to the full pp1a’-nsp4-nsp10 + pp1ab’-nsp4-nsp16) can be made available for others to view? I'm very interested in the proximity of specific AA residues throughout the complex, which may help explain unusual mutational patterns throughout the replicase complex that have emerged independently hundreds of times.",2025-04-15T10:58:18,ryhisner,ryhisner,10.1101/2025.04.10.648184,A structural roadmap for the formation of the coronavirus nsp3/nsp4 double membrane vesicle pore and its implications for polyprotein processing and replication/transcription,"Jason K.
