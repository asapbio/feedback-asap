The paper you sent is quite well-written, yet I find it puzzling in several areas. I hope you will find these comments helpful as you prepare it further for full publication, and in your next work. 1) References in the Introduction. I was surprised to see no mention of the work of: a) Turner, Oros-Peusquens et al (2008), who were able to reliably image the stria of Gennari in several volunteers, with nearly isotropic voxels (0.4x0.4x0.5) mm3 at 3T, using an IR-TSE sequence. While you mentioned the slightly earlier work of Barbier, it is obvious that isotropic voxels with 0.5 mm resolution or smaller are essential for characterization of microstructure, and it was the Turner paper that pioneered this breakthrough. b) Trampel, Ott and Turner (2011), who actually used ultra-high resolution (0.5 mm isotropic) 7T structural MRI to address an important neuroscientific and clinical question--the extent to which congenital blindness alters the structure of the visual cortex. This paper, on its own, contradicts the current paper's statement:""However, in vivo mesoscopic MRI has not advanced beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and has not been incorporated into the toolkit of practicing neuroscientists."" Indeed there are other recent papers which use structural 7T MRI at high resolution to discover new knowledge about brain organization. c) Bazin, Dinse et al (2014) and Waehnert, Dinse et al (2016) which present a complete suite of image processing tools that can ""optimally process mesoscopic imaging data."" These tools, largely created by Pierre-Louis Bazin and including equivolume cortical layering, have already been used widely in some groundbreaking studies, for example Gau et al, Elife 2020. If your group found good reason not to use these tools, for instance preferring to segment your images manually, it would help the community to explain why. It might therefore be a good idea--more courteous and accurate--to tone down some of the claims of novelty made in this Introduction section. 2) Remarks about layer structure in primary visual cortex. You comment (end of Section 3) that ""It can be seen that there are lower T2* values around the middle of the cortical thickness. This structure is likely the stria of Gennari..."". Of course it is the Stria of Gennari. Many researchers have now compared myelin-stained cadaver brain sections with ex vivo and in vivo MRI scans of primary visual cortex. The increased myelin density and higher iron content in the Stria of Gennari significantly reduce T1 and T2*, and this is unquestionably the source of the line in an MRI scan with sufficient spatial resolution, whether qT1, qT2*, phase imaging or simply T1w. No further explanation is needed! The Stueber et al paper of 2014 (not cited here) is quite conclusive. A further comment. The Stria of Gennari in your T1 maps (Figure 6 of your paper) shows up quite poorly. Indeed, there is hardly a decrease in T1 to be seen in the middle of the cortex, especially in the average along the cortical plane. It has become a familiar observation from published papers (such as Duyn et al) that the Stria shows up more clearly and sharply in T2*-weighted images than it does in MP2RAGE T1 maps with the same nominal spatial resolution. It was clear to me several years ago that this effect was probably  due to the MRI sequence, rather than any anatomical subtlety. Iron-stained sections of primary visual cortex show a thickness of the Stria very similar to that seen in myelin stained sections, with a similar increased myelin and iron density towards the white matter. The image sharpness issue seems to be the point spread function of the MP2RAGE sequence. Because each of the long train of echoes is actually recorded at a different inversion time, the point spread is convolved with the recovery curve of the longitudinal magnetization, and is thus broadened. It was to circumvent this problem that I devised the Multi-Shot Multi-Slice Inversion Recovery EPI sequence, now implemented brilliantly by Rosa Sanchez-Panchuelo and colleagues at Nottingham. Here each of the EPI acquisition windows is short in duration compared with T1, and the broadening is much reduced. You can see this in Figure 8 of our 2021 paper (attached), where our MS-IR-EPI T1 maps show a much sharper Stria. Fabrizio Fasano and I demonstrated this at last year's ISMRM using a gel phantom with a sharp boundary between two gels with different T1s. I would recommend this sequence to anyone interested in quantitative mapping of cortical myelin at high resolution. 3) In Section 3.4.2 your paper states: ""T1 contrast is also known to be related to myelination and therefore used for delineating areal borders (Cohen-Adad et al., 2012; Deistung et al., 2013; Dick et al., 2012; Haast et al., 2016; Marques et al., 2017). While there have been efforts to acquire mesoscopic resolution T1 and T1-weighted images in the past (Federau & Gallichan, 2016; Lüsebrink et al., 2021; Lüsebrink et al., 2017), there has not yet been a quantitative T1 dataset together with T2* at mesoscopic resolution in the living human brain."" Yes, indeed, T1 contrast is related to myelination. There are several papers (e.g. Leuze 2017, Morawski 2018) showing that if CLARITY is used to clear the myelin from cadaver brain, T1 contrast completely disappears. Could you put this first line a little more strongly, perhaps? The first paper to argue that quantitative T1 maps should be the most accurate in vivo guide for cortical parcellation was actually Geyer et al (2011, attached), describing results shown at the OHBM meeting in 2010, which then in fact inspired David van Essen and Matt Glasser to attempt their own parcellation of the cortex, partly based on the arbitrary ratio of the image intensities of T1-weighted MP-RAGE images and TSE images (also mostly inversely T1 weighted, but inaccurately denoted 'T2-weighted' images). In the attached Geyer paper you can find a reasonably complete summary of previous related work. 4) At the beginning of Section 4.2 you state: ""However, as argued within (Wallace et al.,2016), mesoscopic in vivo imaging may still be insufficient to capture the subtle changes in myeloarchitecture aside from primary visual cortex where the stria of Gennari is extremely thick."" Perhaps you have missed the papers by Skeide (2018) showing hypermyelination of left auditory cortex in dyslexic individuals, and Kuehn (2017) showing subtle variations in myelination of BA3b relating to somatosensory fields. 5) One last comment--have you tried denoising your images? With luck, you might gain a factor of 3 in SNR, and they would look more convincing.",2022-04-07T20:30:32,disqus_QxHwE8A5az,Robert Turner,10.1101/2021.11.25.470023,Mesoscopic Quantification of Cortical Architecture in the Living Human Brain,"Omer Faruk Gulban, Saskia Bollmann, Renzo Huber, Konrad Wagstyl, Rainer Goebel, Benedikt A.

None of these mechanisms cares about the chemical bonds between the atoms, so there can be no meaningful difference between 1 g/cm2 of melanin and 1 g/cm2 of pretty much any other organic compound.  (This is not necessarily the case for charged particle radiation, like the deuterons in reference [33]).  The chemical formula of melanin is  C18 H10 N2 O4, which has no high-Z elements in it that could enhance x- and gamma-ray attenuation, as noted (with no reply) by VGR Subramanian.  I'm elaborating here for future readers.  In the current version of the article the authors back off slightly from their claims, but they still ignore the basic physical mechanisms that imply that organic material is organic material as far as x- and gamma- radiation shielding is concerned.  Whether it is living material, melanin, etc. cannot make it perform better than any other random slab of CHNO compounds.   To suggest otherwise would require a standard of proof high enough to justify overturning 125 years of settled physics on the interaction of radiation with matter. -David Smith University of California, Santa Cruz",2022-04-06T07:33:18,disqus_PxoJFL5yQ7,David Smith,10.1101/2020.07.16.205534,A Self-Replicating Radiation-Shield for Human Deep-Space Exploration: Radiotrophic Fungi can Attenuate Ionizing Radiation aboard the International Space Station,"Graham K.

However, I wondered why you do not also relate to all those MEG studies that quite successfully localised structures deep in the inferior temporal cortex, like the parahippocampal place area (PPA, e.g. Baldauf & Desimone, 2014, Sci) or the fusiform face area, FFA (see e.g., Khan et al., 2015, PNAS; Baldauf & Desimone, 2014, Sci., DeVries & Baldauf, 2019, JoCN )? One of your arguments in the Intro is how well MEG can register signals from 'deep structures, compared to superficial cortical structures'. However, PPA and FFA in the Inferior Temporal cortex is really about as 'deep' as, e.g., the hippocampus. Isn't the question more whether subcortical structures have a neuronal organization (like much of cortex has a columnar organization) that allows summing magnetic fields?",2022-04-05T16:58:21,,Daniel Baldauf,10.1101/2022.02.28.482228,Magnetoencephalography can reveal deep brain network activities linked to memory processes,"Víctor J.

The Chlamydomonas mutant lacking LHCBM1 ( npq5) displays a low NPQ phenotype. The authors found that the antenna size and LHCSR3 accumulation are not responsible for the lower NPQ phenotype in npq5. They also artificially acidified the lumenal pH to protonate LHCSR3 for NPQ induction and found that npq5 NPQ is still low. They propose that absence of LHCBM1 could alter the association of LHCSR3 with the PSII supercomplex or that LHCBM1 interacts with LHCSR3 which would enhance its quenching capacity. This work enriches the knowledge about the impact of lack of LHCBM1 on antenna size, PSII function, LHCSR1 and 3 proteins accumulation and NPQ capacity during a 48-h high light treatment. Major comments - Fig. 1, it is stated that LHCBM1 (Type IV) does not accumulate but Fig. S1 and S2 show that Type IV accumulates between 7 and 9% of the total amount of LHCBMs. Could you comment on this accumulation, and whether it increases in high light? - Statistical test between WT and npq5 for all the data represented in bar graphs would be required to state that differences are significant. Consider showing all data points in addition to error bars. - Consider providing Fo and Fm values for all fluorescence measurements (and D1 accumulation) to discuss whether a possible increased Fo in npq5 in HL is due to disconnected antenna and/or loss of functional core complexes. - Discussion, discuss why there is much less LHCSR1 in the npq5 mutant? Is this regulation at the transcriptional or post-translational level? It could be that LHCBM1 interacts with LHCSR1 preventing its degradation. In the abstract, and discussion, as no interaction data is shown, consider toning down statements regarding LHCBM1 interaction with LHCSR3. - Discussion, discuss whether similar results were observed for the npq4 mutant (increased antenna size in HL and less functional PSII observed in npq5). Is this phenotype linked to the low NPQ capacity or specific to the lower level of LHCBM1 in the npq5 mutant? Minor comments - Please give a title to summarize the first result in Fig. 1. In the result section, consider making the section subtitles more informative about the main result from that section (e.g., “Photoprotection capacity after high-light acclimation” could be “NPQ induction is severely hampered in npq5 after high-light acclimation”). - Page 3, method, actinic light of 1,500 μmol photons.m-2.s-1 (and saturating pulses of 12,000 μmol photons.m-2.s-1) are used for the fluorescence measurements. Comment on the choice of such a high light intensity (and high intensity pulses, actinic effect?). Why not use a light intensity closer to the HL treatment? Also state length of dark-acclimation prior to each type of measurement. - Immunoblot method, state dilutions used and secondary antibody type and dilution used. - Page 4, it is stated that “the level of the other LHCBMs is similar to that of WT (CC-425)” by referring to Fig. S1 and S2. It is difficult to see in Fig. S1 that the level of other LHCBMs is similar in npq5 and WT as the data is represented in percentage of total LHCBMs. Could you also represent the amount of the different LHCBMs in npq5 normalized to WT in a bar graph? For the Type III and Type II/I LHCBMs accumulation, a dilution series might be best for quantification to ensure that CP47 antibody signal is not saturated. In Fig. S1, npq5 should be italic. In Fig. S2, one of the labels is likely wrong: there are two 48h time points. By biological replica, is it meant three independent batches of grown and treated cells? What is the fourth band right below the upper band detected by the LHCBM5 antibody at 48h? - Fig. 5, please enlarge panels B and C to match panel A. - Fig. 6, specify in the legend that 24h and 48h refer to the HL treatment. - Discussion, “and confirmed here by analysis of the [ npq5 ] mutant” (not npq4) Jingfang Hao and Pierrick Bru (Umeå University) - not prompted by a journal; this review was written within a preprint  journal club with input from group discussion including Alizée Malnoë, Aurélie Crepin, Fadime Demirel, Jack Forsman and Domenica Farci.",2022-04-05T14:10:29,alizee_malnoe,Alizée Malnoë,10.1101/2022.01.13.476201,The role of LHCBM1 in non-photochemical quenching in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,"Xin Liu, Wojciech Nawrocki, Roberta Croce",2022-01-14

First, I absolutely agree that sampling more timepoints and more locations would certainly give us more insight into how consistent microbiome patterns are over space and time and with respect to infection status. But since this was the first such study in wild Daphnia microbiomes, we wanted to start with the simplest experiment design to establish that there were indeed microbiome changes correlating with infection (the clear differences we found were surprising given that these animals were taken directly from the field; we expected far greater variation between replicates, and we also expected any signal associated with infection to be weak, see lines 268-271.) This site was chosen based on routine infection prevalence monitoring data: we chose the site that had the highest infection rate so we could collect enough animals for the study. The samples were not stored, processing began immediately and was completed within 24 hours of the Daphnia being collected from the lake; during this time they were kept at room temperature in filtered lake water. For coverage, we plotted rarefaction curves (number of OTUs versus sequencing depth) and found that that the curves even out around 65,000 reads for all samples, suggesting we discovered most OTUs that were present. We used the UNOISE algorithm to remove chimeras. Clustering the OTUs at the standard 97% sequence similarity accounts for possible PCR and sequencing errors, so we avoided classifying each strain variant as a separate OTU. We did not use qPCR or culturing to quantify bacterial load, so all our 16S results refer to relative abundances only. This would be a very interesting question to persue, but both these methods have their associated biases: 16S qPCRs would pick up dead bacteria whereas culturing would only detect culturable bacteria. We did use a 16S qPCR as part of the standard library preparation procedure to avoid overamplifying the samples. We did not correct for 16S gene copy number or variance in genome sizes, and we acknowledge that this remains a general limitation in microbiome studies; it is also difficult to correct for since most OTUs were only identified till the Order or Family level, and gene copy number can vary within a genus. In the results: thank you for pointing out these issues. The horizontal spread of points in Fig. 2 do not convey information. Clustering points in Fig. 3 was a little challenging due to the variation between replicates, but we will continue to work on improving all figures. Thank you for your time and I hope this answers your questions. I look forward to another discussion if need be!

Rodriguez et al. and Vanni et al. have a completely different focus. a. Vanni et al. focused on developing a methodology for unifying known and unknown protein families. They demonstrated how this strategy can reduce the number of unknowns in metagenomics datasets, and analyzed the diversity and lineage-specificity of functionally unknown protein clusters vs the known ones using metagenomic and genomic gene catalogs. Focus: novel methods and known vs unknown comparisons. b. Rodríguez del Río et al. focused on characterizing a subset of high-quality predictions of unknown protein families that are unique from uncultivated lineages, non-orphan and under strong selection; further delineating novel protein families that i) co-occur in the same genome of species from particular lineages, ii) are potentially associated with specific metabolic pathways or iii) represent putative synapomorphic traits for high-rank uncultivated lineages. Focus: characterizing the unique genetic repertory of uncultivated taxa. 3. All findings in Rodriguez del Río et al. refer to a conceptually different set of data as compared to Vanni et al. a. In Vanni et al. most analyses refer to a generic classification of protein families into functionally known versus unknown, without distinguishing between those present in cultured and uncultured species, nor discarding orphan genes (e.g. ~60% of their lineage-specific clusters are species-specific). b. In Rodríguez del Río et al., all results and biological interpretations refer to a subset of protein families within the unknown category that are exclusive from uncultivated organisms, not orphan, and having particular genomic properties (e.g. under strong purifying selection). No results are reported that refer to comparisons between known and unknown protein families, and no results can be extrapolated to the general pool of unknowns. 4. Rodríguez del Río et al. focused on maximizing the quality of predictions, while Vanni et al. used a comprehensive approach. a. The unknown protein families predicted in Rodríguez del Río et al. were inferred based on mostly full-length genes that span more than one species, contain a conserved region of at least 20aa, have expression data/predictions, are under purifying selection, have no obvious homologs in cultured species, and have a reference genome to infer reliable taxonomic annotations and genomic contexts. As a result, all protein clusters with detectable homologs in cultured species and the vast majority of the unknowns were discarded and not included in subsequent analyses. b. Vanni et al. used a comprehensive approach for most of their biological analyses, using a set of clusters that might be over-split, due to the large number of fragmented genes present in metagenomics (as recognised in their own paper)  and orphan genes (i.e. no homologs beyond species level). 5. Major findings in Rodriguez del Río et al. are novel and do not overlap with the observations in Vanni et al. a. Rodríguez del Río et al. reconstructed the genomic context and calculated synteny conservation for over 400k unknown protein families, delineating particular cases embedded in highly conserved functional contexts associated with key metabolic processes. In Vanni et al., genomic context conservation is shallowly showcased as an example of the potential of their approach. b. Rodríguez del Río et al., identified uncultivated lineages where individual organisms contain a striking number of the selected *subset* of unknown protein families from their catalog (i.e. high-quality, uncultivated-only, not-orphan novel fams per genome), linking them to potential functional roles; which does not compare with the observations reported in Vanni et al. By contrast, and although the data sets used are not equivalent, results in Rodriguez del Río et al. would largely contradict the main observation made in Vanni et al. about the Patescibacteria phylum having the greatest content of unknowns (see section 3). c. Rodríguez del Río et al. predicted over 900 novel protein families as putative synapomorphic traits for high-rank uncultivated lineages. This is, novel traits that are both highly specific and prevalent for all organisms under a given lineage. In their letter, Vanni et al. confronted their lineage-specificity (LS) results with our synapomorphic predictions, which are not comparable. As we show in section 4 of this report, the LS results shown by Vanni et al. would be incorrect if interpreted as synapomorphies. Most importantly, Vanni et al never discussed any protein family that could potentially represent a synapomorphic trait at basal taxonomic levels, and only brought this claim in their letter. d. Rodríguez del Río et al. reported putative synapomorphic protein families at high-rank levels as traits of great evolutionary significance, showing that they are also under stronger selective pressures than other unknown families. The results in Vanni et al. do not compare conceptually or technically with any of those findings: they report that functionally unknown protein families are more phylogenetically conserved than the known ones, which addresses a different question, performs a different comparison and uses a different metric than in Rodriguez del Río et al. (see section 5 for additional data). e. The subset of unknown protein families predicted in Rodriguez del Río et al. inverts the ecological patterns observed in Vanni et al. and Coelho et al. (see section 6) i. Vanni et al. reported functionally unknown genes to be ecologically narrow, acknowledging the existence of a small fraction of broadly distributed families in all the protein family categories (known and unknown). ii. Rodríguez del Río et al. demonstrate that the subset of predictions delineated with their analyses are largely widespread across samples and biomes, and most are not associated with mobile elements. f. Rodríguez del Río et al. make available an online resource to graphically explore and interpret their predictions ( https://novelfam.cgmlab.org), which is largely different both in content and form from the AGNOSTOS database released in Vanni et al. ( https://doi.org/10.6084/m9..... 6. The methods used in Rodriguez del Río et al. are standard in the field, already published, and properly cited. (see section 8) a. The methodology used to identify novel gene families does not follow the approach presented in Vanni et al, but the one published by us and colleagues in Salazar et al, 2019. In such work, published prior to Vanni et al., we already described a method to unify known and unknown protein families using genomic and metagenomic data, which we also used to predict putative functions of unknown metagenomic protein families based on co-expression analyses. b. Rodríguez del Río el al. used AntiFam to locate spurious sequences, which is a generic procedure.  We don't think this should be taken as a lack of recognition to Vanni et al. c.  Rodríguez del Río el al. mapped their predictions to the most relevant catalog of unknown, but putatively functional, small peptides (Sberro et al. 2019); which is properly cited. We don't think this should be taken as a lack of recognition to Vanni et al. d. Rodríguez del Río et al mapped all their predictions to Price et al. to provide further hints on their putative functional roles. Vanni et al. used one example from Price et al. to showcase the use of genomic context for functional analyses. We don't know how our use of Price et al. could mean a lack of recognition to Vanni et al. e. Rodíguez del Río et al. developed their own ad hoc method to identify and date synapomorphic traits at high-rank levels, which is, as we show in section 4, conceptually different from the method used in Vanni et al.

Cohen as my mentor in Fall 2021: In this study, authors used high-density probes to perform large-scale neural recordings for identifying and characterizing the coordinated activity across MEC grid-cell modules in the presence and absence of visual cues. Authors aim to show that the inter-module activity in MEC is coordinated even in visual-sensory deprived conditions. The study is well-designed to test the hypothesis that local networks within MEC can calibrate the inter-module activity even in absence of visual feedback of animals' spatial location. With the cutting edge experimental and statistical tools, this study provides novel insights into the role of MEC activity in maintaining a coherent cognitive map. There are a few concerns about module classification, and application and validity of dimensionality reduction technique. Major concerns: The exact definition of the term ""module"" is unclear, and a more precise definition will help readers understand the impact of the findings. For example, is a module defined by a specific volume of tissue, or number of cells in a volume, or a number of cells within a network showing toroidal topology manifolds, or functional connectivity? Relatedly, what are the estimated physical dimensions of the modules in EC? Are different cell types part of each module across layers? How different are the probabilities that two cells with correlated activity could belong either to the same or different module (line 9-13 on page 5)? It is an interesting observation that grid cell modules retain the coordination even when mapping between grid cell activity and position deteriorates (line 23-24 on page 5). What does the coordination in such a case reflect, if not position? Are there any scenarios where position decoding is possible even when grid cell modules do not retain coordination? Are there any sessions when light recording is followed by dark session to compare the change in grid cell coordination across light-then-dark sessions? (line 37 on page 5) In line 37 on page 5, light recording sessions have a broader duration range of 30-60min. Is it possible that the difference in the duration of dark vs light sessions led to a systematic bias? It may be helpful for readers to compare the ratio of time in dark vs. light for all the individual animals or comparing the total time for each animal in dark (all dark session durations combined) and light (all light session durations combined). Similarly to prevent the doubts about systematic bias in spiking data (line 1 on page 6), it would be helpful to compare the ratio of spikes in light vs dark for each of the 842 grid cells identified in the experiments. Including the information about temporal distribution of spikes would also be helpful to address whether all the grid cells were active for full session or they varied their activity within different epochs of a session i.e were all 500+ spikes spread homogeneously over full session? McInnes et al mentions that UMAP is more reliable for large datasets and UMAP assumes there is manifold structure in the data. Considering this along with the fact that the number of datapoints processed through UMAP in this study are very close to the lower limit for UMAP, are there other alternate dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g. PHATE which may be more suitable for the size of datasets for this study) that lead to similar conclusions in this study? Could authors quantify the false positives that could occur due to limitations of UMAP in clustering of grid cells into different modules? Also, could authors demonstrate the reliability of module classification e.g. through cross-validation or split-half reliability? According to Roy et al 2000 (Neural Computation), low firing rates (<10spikes/s) often lead to spurious correlations. Hence, it may be helpful to compare the likelihood for actual, not down-sampled, mean-firing rate between light and dark. Also, considering the issue with correlations for low-rate spike trains, are there any alternative methods to best estimate inter-module coordination other than pairwise correlations? What are the approximate dimensions of the brain region around the tip of a tetrode vs a recording site on the neuropixel probes used in this study? If they are considerably different, should tetrode data have comparable statistical interdependence across modules as we expect for neuropixel probes? If not, it brings to question the validity of applying the statistical methods used for tetrode data to neuropixel data. Figure 2 and Supplementary Fig.2 - module classification and clustering issue: Supp Fig 2 - Grid M3 in ‘a’ and M2 in ‘c’ appear too close to the respective non-grid clusters, do the results hold if such grids are excluded from the data? Minor concerns: Introduction - Line 6-9: “the recurrent ...sensory inputs.” - a reference for this statement would be helpful. It may be useful to mention in discussion about which spatial encoding mechanism would render grid-cell coordination sustain in darkness? Odor cues and Path integration? (Fischler-Ruiz et al 2021 Cell), Step-count? Proprioception? Page 4 – line 1-2: “The grid cells within a module encode together a two dimensional quantity which, in some conditions – could be dissociated from the true position of the animal” It is not clear why authors mention this fact. It may be helpful to relate this to the findings. Page 4 - Line 14-16 – “Since population activity of an individual module lies on a two-dimensional manifold, the joint activity of M modules spans, at least in principle, a 2M dimensional space” Reference for Mathematical principle on which this statement is based.? References for this statement supporting whether the joint activity of M modules spans at least 2M dimensional space or different? Please add references for the statement in Line 8-9 on page 5. Line 16-18 – “However, during continuous motion…..the state of each module is faithfully mapped to the location of the animal in two dimensional space”. What is the definition of continuous motion (3cm/s?)? How consistent is it across the studies on spatial encoding of Ent cortex.? If there is tactile/olfactory feedback in the dark, would the modules represent increased accuracy of encoding spatial location? Line 26: For clarity, ‘rate adjusted likelihood’ could be referred to in the manuscript as ‘likelihoodRA’ instead of just ‘likelihood’.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.16.460656v2#comment-5809613204,biorxivstage,2,"In this paper, the author uses innovative SVD rotation methods to analyze previous serial crystallography datasets with the aim of delineating retinal isomerization in bacteriorhodopsin (bR). This analysis reveals novel intermediate states that lend insight into how the transition takes place as well as the role played by residues in bR’s active site. The author hypothesizes that a non-specific Coulomb attraction force triggers sampling of multiple cis conformations and single bond rotations in retinal, but the selection of the 13-cis conformation is achieved by the stereochemical constraints in the protein environment. The author lays out the major questions of the paper very clearly in the introduction and the results and discussion sections remain well-focused on answering those questions. The mathematical and computational methods presented here demonstrate how they can be used to tease out the intermediates from “multi” datasets (as shown by the author in his other publications). We share the author’s frustration that “never-observed dataset reconstituted from a collection of experimental datasets does not match the well-established crystallographic template of PDB” - there are interesting new directions in joint refinement across datasets that are considered siloed by the PDB - and this paper contributes well to that frontier. Overall, the paper is well written and the methods section is particularly instructive in the general approach, but lacking details that would allow us to follow the exact implementation used for this paper. Major Points: 1. Overall: no statement on data/code availability is given. Even if proprietary software is used, it is essential to know what options are used and to have a detailed protocol to reproduce the work. 2. The author comments on how timepoints from the Kovacs et al drive the vectors of interest (U10, U14, U17), yet it’s challenging to differentiate the insights gained from the SVD over FO-FO maps from Kovacs. We suggest a quantitative comparison showing signal-to-noise or goodness of fit which may help the reader interpret the benefits gained from SVD. 3. While the methods section is quite detailed in describing how SVD is performed and how the Ren rotations retain the orthonormal properties of the SVD, the details of how the angles for rotations are chosen are not given. The author says “SVD analysis presented in this paper employs rotations extensively” but what angles of rotations were sampled? Which were the good rotations and which were the bad rotations? A read-through of the earlier papers of the author (Ren 2019, Ren 2016) did not provide answers for these questions either (with large portions of the text in the methods sections being nearly identical between these papers) We infer this is using the software “Dynamix” based on the Acknowledgements. While it is understandable that decisions on what rotations need to be done are subjective, it is imperative that the author guides the reader through these decisions to help in reproduction/application of this method. Without these details it is difficult to know, for example, whether the oscillatory vectors are related to particular choices in the SVD procedure or are relatively without bias. 4. Majority of datasets are clustered in the current SVD iteration - did another Ren rotation not separate Kovacs datasets according to an interesting piece of metadata? This seems like an opportunity to rotate the SVD and further demonstrate the utility of the Ren rotation method. 5. The author shows the oscillatory behavior of 5 pairs of components in figure S3. But how did he arrive at these 5 pairs? Did other pairs not show such kind of oscillatory behavior? 6. The author goes into fine details of the intermediate conformations of retinal and shows differences in distances in the range of less than an angstrom. Is there a goodness-of-fit metric that can be used by the author to show that the atomic positions determined by the author are indeed the best/only possible positions? What if there is another intermediate conformation of retinal that fits equally well into the densities but does not have the S-shaped creasing? How do these conformations navigate the need to fit to density without being too high energy? Minor points: 1. Labeling of “inboard” and “outboard” terms can be done in main Figure 1 rather than referring reader to S1 2. Figure 2(b): overall trend is useful, might there be an easier way to visualize? Some sort of 1D - distance plot of integrated intensities? 3. Panel C in figure 2 is cited extensively in the text. Rather than mentioning the sub-panels as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd panel, etc., the author could just split panel c into d,e,f, etc. 4. Figure 2(c) - lines are difficult to visualize. They could be made bold. The author could also reduce the panel to show only atomic displacement and torsion angle and move the rest to supplement if necessary, so that the two main plots could be made bigger for easier interpretation. 5. Figure 1(c) and Figure 3(a) & (b) are very difficult to interpret. The author can zoom in further and use translucent volume rendering rather than mesh 6. Figure 3(d) - The author could label as “helix A, B, …, G” so that it’s immediately obvious what’s shown in figure, otherwise a nice illustration of motion 7. Figure 3(e) retinal could be color coded or more easily separated from amino acids to make it easier and faster to interpret. 8. The maps of I’ (Fig S6), I (Fig S7), J’ (Fig S9) and J (Fig S10) are contoured at different sigma levels presumably due to the Fo contributions differing based on the reconstitution procedure. Is there any trend in the reconstitution that would guide us to calibrate what sigma levels to be equivalent across datasets, or is this purely visual?

Therefore, I will comment primarily on the MR physics/interpretation, whereas the morphometric analysis and anatomical interpretations are better suited for another reviewer. Recommendation: Major revision This is an ambitious article that helps 7T deliver on its promise of high-resolution MRI. The authors acquired T1 and T2* weighted images at 0.35mm isotropic resolution on 5 healthy participants. They implemented a correction for blood motion artifacts, as well as a cortical analysis toolbox for visualizing and characterizing the cortical surface. Additionally they fitted for T1 and T2* maps. The authors have shared the data and the code, making it easier to fill in some gaps that are present in the manuscript. The authors believe that their work will bring mesoscopic imaging to clinical practice because of (i) their protocol, (ii) their post-processing tools and (iii) their high-quality qMRI datasets. The images are impressive, even though the coverage is limited (~3cm in the inferior-superior direction). The correction works well, and the analysis appears robust, even though some basic SNR/CNR measurements are missing. I also believe that it is a little too early to perform quantitative MRI on such datasets (see points 3 and 4 below). I would suggest performing phantom studies before moving on to in vivo qMRI maps. Below are some comments/suggestions to improve the manuscript. MAJOR COMMENTS 1. I was missing a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. In particular, a discussion of SNR would have been very useful to evaluate the efficiency of the scans. While the protocol is relatively fast, the coverage is also limited, and a visual assessment is not enough to convince me of the quality of the images. A proper SNR analysis combined with histograms would be useful. For example, in Figure 2 it appears that compositing reduces the contrast. Not sure what happens to the SNR and CNR, would be important to get those numbers and how much the post-processing changes them. 2. Related to the above point: the authors share the raw data, but these are very large datasets and OSF download speeds are low. After downloading the zipped data I received a message that I cannot expand it ( screenshot), so I was not able to inspect the images. Also, the shared scripts appear well-documented, but I was not able to reproduce the analysis because of too many dependencies. A combination of Jupyter notebooks and containers (possibly via MyBinder) would make it much easier to reproduce the analysis. 3. Figure 1: The quantitative MRI maps do not have units/colormaps, so it is very difficult to evaluate them. For example, there appears to be a strong B1 effect, so more details about the B1 transmit/receive would be important for qMRI validation. Why weren’t field maps acquired? Also, the 2D histograms are informative, but for qMRI it is essential to conduct scan-rescan to determine the stability of the images and accompanying maps. 4. Related to the above point, in Figure 9 there seems to be a bias in the T1 values between the left and right Heschl’s gyrus. And in Figures 8 and 10 one can notice that the extreme percentiles (red lines) of one subject interact with the medians (white lines) of another subject. Is there a physiological interpretation for this, or could it be a field effect? In general, without reliable B0/B1 one could have significant non-uniformities and offsets that could translate into inaccurate quantitative MRI maps. 5. p. 17. What was the reason for the chosen bandwidth and the 6/8 partial Fourier? Was there a time limit to the acquisition? On p. 17 the authors argue that they were hoping to reduce acquisition times, but neither points above are big time-savers and would improve the quality of the images. MINOR POINTS AND TYPOS The field strength and the manufacturer not mentioned anywhere in the manuscript.

The paper shows that Desmodium releases volatiles, as we also demonstrate. However, it is quite apparent from their data that it does not do so constitutively: the various extracts that were used were highly variable in release rates, which is typical for induction. The high levels of green-leaf volatiles reported, which were absent in our samples, are also a telltale sign of damage. In the paper, maize also released some volatiles, indicating some above or below ground herbivore induction too. But, without the critical data on volatile release following controlled herbivore damage (i.e. a positive control) or internal standards, it is difficult to assess the results. In contrast, our carefully collected data shows that when unchallenged, neither Desmodium, nor maize release volatiles. We have analyzed hundreds of samples from various geographic locations (Sweden, Tanzania, Uganda, South Africa), from the greenhouse and the field, using different soils and microbial augmentations, using entrainments as well as SPME. All these samples, without exception, show that undamaged Desmodium does not release the ‘push’ volatiles constitutively (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes), while Melinis does constitutively release a diversity of terpenes in very large quantities. As we know, plants generally do not release volatiles constitutively. Some do, often through glandular trichomes (e.g. Melinis), which Desmodium lacks. Upon induction Desmodium indeed releases volatiles, but it is low compared to induced maize and Melinis. Between brackets, the above also shows that differences in methodology (SPME versus entrainments) cannot explain the differences between the studies, which was perhaps implied by Prof. Bruce’s comment. However, most significant is that our large number of field collections demonstrate that Desmodium rarely and minimally releases volatiles in the field, even though most plants showed some herbivore damage. In contrast, maize releases substantial amounts and a large diversity of terpenes. To be at the basis of reducing Lepidoptera pest pressure in maize, Desmodium would have to reliably and at high levels release volatiles in the field, whether induced or constitutively. Ironically, if pest reduction would depend on volatiles, maize seems to do a much better job. Indeed, our data also show that whole Desmodium plants did not repel S. frugiperda from ovipositing on maize plants. Our research provides the first experimental evidence that Desmodium does not constitutively release volatiles, and only minimally and unreliably in the field, in response to herbivory. This is very different from what has been suggested over the last two decades (in the absence of data), and implies that the pest suppressive role of Desmodium is due to other mechanisms. We provide such an alternative mechanism: Desmodium is a catch crop that truncates larval development and kills insects. Such observations have been made in the somewhat grey literature, with even vertebrates found to be captured by Desmodium. Obviously, how the mechanism exactly plays out in the field under various conditions needs further detailed field studies. Knowing the exact mechanisms of pest suppression is critical to further improve the maize intercropping system, and to rationally translate such sustainable pest suppressive intercropping methods in other cropping systems. We are keen on teasing out the interplay of mechanisms together with other researchers, particularly at icipe, who designed the system in the first place.

I quickly glanced through your manuscript and am intrigued by supplementary Figure 12. It looks to me that in some cell types Yap (transcript?) level correlates extraordinarily well with total transcript level (if I understood those panels correctly) whereas in others there is no correlation at all. This pattern is not seen with Myc or Mtor. I am wondering if these data suggest that the correlation between Yap and hypertranscription is selective for cell-type, whereas Mtor (and maybe Myc) is more generic. Furthermore, YAP protein activity/stability is highly regulated, which may also affected your analysis, which I assume is based on transcript levels. For the ChEA data analysis, I wonder whether YAP's preferential binding for enhancers (versus Myc for promoters) may have an effect on the result.",2022-03-24T22:51:01,xinweicao,Xinwei Cao,10.1101/2021.12.13.472426,Absolute Scaling of Single-Cell Transcriptomes Reveals Pervasive Hypertranscription in Adult Stem and Progenitor Cells,"Yun-Kyo Kim, Miguel Ramalho-Santos",2021-12-13

To think that worker bees and queen bees are not only distinct in their roles within the colony and their biology, but also display diverging gut microbiomes specific to the ecological niche to which it resides and thus a varying metabolism is quite fascinating. I do have some questions concerning quality control of your methods, though. What was the PCR target region, and how many PCR cycles were run? Minimizing the number of rounds of PCR reduces the sequencing error rate and fraction of chimeric sequences. I did see that you used universal primers to amplify the V4 region of the 16sRNA gene. Likewise, your methods section mentions quality filtering with VSEARCH, but other specifics are limited. I appreciate you considering both the dominant and rare taxa appropriately, and your handling and preparation of samples prior to DNA extraction was spot on. Further, OTU abundance was calculated by mapping the total quality-filtered paired reads to the final clusters, with the resulting abundances normalized by the total 16s rRNA gene copy numbers as estimated through qPCR, and differences in copy numbers across samples were evaluated with an aligned Rank Transformation of a Factorial Model with the R package ARTool. This method was explained well and is thorough. What about measuring sequencing coverage of the communities? Also, I did not see any mention of internal standards at the PCR step or the DNA extraction step.

What is the PCR target region, primers used, # of cycles? The PCR target region was V4 and 30 cycles were run. The primers used were never listed. The article also failed to provide the temperatures and duration of the cycles. 2. Does the bioinformatics method include steps to minimize PCR errors and chimeras? The “quality screening” in mothur should be explicit as to the filtering procedures. 3. Given that microbial communities are uneven and dominated, does the analysis focus on the dominant taxa, and consider the rate taxa appropriately? The relative abundance of C. diff was shown in supp fig 2, but no data or analysis of dominate taxa was given. 4. How are samples taken and handled before DNA extraction? Mice were given antibiotics and orally given C. difficile spores, then cecal samples were removed from their corpses. The cecal samples were then ground in a mortar and stored at -80 degrees. 5. Are OTU abundances corrected for variance in 16S copy number and for variances in genome size? No. 6. Is sequencing coverage of the communities measured and it is complete? No coverage measures were mentioned. # of sequence per sample not given. No rarefaction curves shown. 7. Does the PCR step contain internal standards? the DNA extraction step? the sequencing step? No, none of the three steps contained internal standards. 8. Is the sampling strategy well described and appropriate for the microbiome of interest? Yes, a description can be found in question 2, and it is appropriate for the microbiome. 9. Can you see total number of sequences obtained per sample and how many after quality filtering (and what criteria are used for quality filtering)? No and filtering steps were not described in detail. 10. 16S profile is normalized. Does the study also use some method to quantify total bacterial numbers, like qPCR or culture? The study measures bacterial metabolites as a quantification method. Additional Comments: The experiment lacked an obvious control group. The method of chimera screening was not stated, only the database used.",2022-03-23T22:47:26,trey_baker,Trey Baker,10.1101/092304,Clostridium difficile colonizes alternative nutrient niches during infection across distinct murine gut microbiomes,"Matthew L.

The DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing steps utilize many internal standards and controls to ensure that each step is accurately producing the desired outcomes. The PCR amplification step utilizes 35 cycles which is quite high and can lead to the introduction of more errors within the DNA that is amplified therefore reducing the number of cycles to 25 would be beneficial in avoiding this possibility. The sequencing step on an Illumina MiSeq platform using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 300PE is normalized but fails to convey the number of reads that are taken per sample as well as what program is being used to randomly draw each sample. Next, further explanation of how the number of overlapping random OTUs between all pairs of compartments are calculated and why was this step repeated a 10,000 times. Often data sets that have a very large sample size can produce data that appears to be normally distributed but is actually not therefore it is important to determine the effective sample size sample of 10000 to determine the normality of the collected data. A Shapiro wilks test for normality will be useful determining the normality of your data. For statistical analysis, a chi squared test is used to determine the significance of the highest number of random overlapping OTUs among the 10,000 permutations against the number of observed overlapping OTUs for that pair of compartments but there is no mention of an analysis of Alpha, Beta or gamma diversity among the sampled microbiome as well as a designation of goods coverage. To further analyze the soil microbiome, a quantification of the total bacteria community can be done using qPCR or culturing techniques in order to determine the abundance of the bacteria and their mechanisms used to manipulate the community’s ecology. #SHSU3594",2022-03-23T14:34:58,jonathoncorral,Jonathon Corral,10.1101/2020.09.30.320317,Soil microbial diversity impacts plant microbiota more than herbivory,"Antonino Malacrinò, Alison J.

In the study the mice were given water that contained four different antibiotics. Is this combination of antibiotics truly representative of what is given to human patients. Do human patients receive this strong antibiotic treatment for the same two week duration? The next comments I have apply to the 16S rDNA sequencing methodology. For stool collection, I would provide more details about if the mice were sacrificed in order collect stool samples or if stool was simply collected from the cage. As mice are known to be coprophagic. Adding an internal standard step for the DNA extraction step would help confirm that there are no errors with the DNA extraction method. I would also include the forward and reverse primers and primer sequences that were used for your study. The number of sequences per sample and total number of sequences is a detail that should also be found within this section.  If and how PCR errors and chimeras were addressed is another addition to consider. With this, I would include the specific program for this step (i.e. ChimeraSlayer).  I would include whether or not there was a step conducted to address the sequencing coverage of your samples. Inclusion of PCR details such as the number cycles, temperature, and time is a detail that should be included. Clarification of how taxa diversity and abundance were decided would be beneficial for the reader. Were Operational Taxonomical Units, OTUs, created for the calculation of alpha and beta diversity.

Grammar throughout the paper can be improved, this can easily be done by a third-party program such as Grammarly or within Word program.  Beta diversity was explained in detail and was well received but I was unable to find data bout alpha diversity. I will propose the following questions to personally learn more about the research as well as they may aid in expanding on the data: Were there any internal steps to preserve the samples? How were the singletons and doubletons dealt with? Were the patients screened for other diseases that may impact the gut microbiome? Such as diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, or irritable bowel syndrome. How were the methods for sequencing the V4 hypervariable region of the 16s rRNA gene adapted?

As a researcher with a broad and acute interest in river microbiome, this paper addresses its finding in a more transparent manner. It is impressive to see a detailed method section along with data analysis that shows a high reproducibility of your work. Abstract - Abstract addresses the research question of interest. It also summarizes the important findings of the study. I suggest adding the names of the abundant and rare taxa found in water and sediments into the abstract. Introduction - The introduction is well written using literature available under this topic. This clearly discusses the previous research that points towards the question of interest. Methods - The sampling method is well described. I suggest including the time that samples were collected because this can have a certain impact on the physiological properties of water. Storage of samples in liquid nitrogen is a good approach. Missing information about internal standards used during extraction is a limitation. Details on how the template DNA is quantified after extraction is absent. A negative control or an internal standard that was used to monitor PCR errors is not mentioned in the methodology. I appreciate describing the parameters and criteria used for pre-processing of sequences in detail which improves the reproducibility of your work. Making your raw sequence data accessible to others is commendable. I would suggest you include details about internal standards used in the sequencing step. Defining rare and abundant taxa criteria is appreciated as many studies do not mention that. I would like to see the number of sequences obtained per sample which would also clarify why the sequence data were normalized at this depth of 27,890 sequences per sample. Also, I would suggest you mention the usage of R 4.0.4 for the analysis at an earlier statement under the data analyses section where beta diversity analysis is described. Then the reader will get a better understanding that beta diversity analyses were done using R rather than finding it at the end of the data analysis part. Results- The major findings in terms of the whole, dominant, and rare communities are clearly visualized using boxplots and Venn diagrams. I would suggest you include a table that shows alpha diversity indices (Chao 1, observed OTUs) of each sample along with coverage. Another major suggestion I would like to propose is presenting your results (at least dominant phyla) using a higher taxonomic level like class/family or genus other than phylum level (if possible). This would give more insight to researchers in understanding the microbiome diversity of the thermokarst lakes which can be useful for future research.",2022-03-23T03:50:42,sanduniranasinghe,sanduni ranasinghe,10.1101/2021.05.26.445882,"Abundant and rare bacterial taxa structuring differently in sediment and water in thermokarst lakes in the Yellow River Source area, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau","Ze Ren, Cheng Zhang, Xia Li, Kang Ma, Baoshan Cui",2021-09-12

The study has a logical pathway and contains experiments that correlate well with the research question being investigated. Considering this, this study is easy to follow and flows well. It does not take much time to understand the basis of this article. The methods and materials section of this article mainly focuses on 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing in order to create a bacterial profile within the gut microbiome of endurance runners in Japan. By focusing on quality control, I would suggest adding which specific primers were used for PCR. I would also recommend lowering the amount of PCR cycles in order to minimize error and chimeras. I also suggest that there should be more detail in the sampling collection subsection by using the information from the results section. In order to make sure that PCR, DNA extraction, and sequencing occurred with minimal error, I would also suggest having internal standards. For example, using individual strains as a control can help validate the process of 16S profiling. Gluconeogenesis is a highlight within this study and a well-known physiological process within animals. However, I would suggest adding a brief section explaining the process in order to further help the reader understand the material given. Bacteroides uniformis is another focal point in this study. Understanding the background of how this bacteria is normally can also help build a foundation and further strengthen the study. Overall, this study is well done and opens up potential topics of using certain bacteria to evaluate athletic performance levels in humans.

Another point that interested me, was that they didn’t identify the variable region they’re targeting in the experiment. There was also no mention of the standard filtering of the sequence, what did the team use in this experiment? There was also no variance of the genome size mentioned in the article. The sample retrieving method is mentioned, they extracted the bacterial samples from the vacuum filters and dust collected from the ISS, as well from the astronaut’s skin to characterize. However, what steps were taken to ensure no contamination was introduced within the samples retrieved? The article doesn’t mention how the bacterial samples were kept in sterile environments before shotgun-sequencing. They do mention the method used to quantify the Antibiotic resistance bacterial genes, subculturing the samples retrieved from the space station then comparing them with the same species of bacteria pre- and post-launch for uniqueness. I would suggest adding how the team collected the samples before sequencing, to give the reader insight on what steps were taken to isolate the bacterial genes.

The number of cycles done can introduce errors if it is too high, so a cycle number of around 20-25 is ideal. Did you use universal primers or were there specific ones used? Were any primer pads added to prevent hairpin formation? There is also no mention of a negative control used in the PCR step, or any other internal standards to prevent error. Were there any internal standards steps taken for PCR, extraction, or sequencing? The coverage of alpha and beta diversity is there and is sufficient, but there is also no statistical analyses of gamma diversity of the microbiomes. Gamma diversity is a measure of the overall diversity for the different ecosystems within a region.There is a mention of quality filtering for chimera removal, which is very good. Despite the coverage of chimera filtering, operational taxonomic units are not explained. Did you cluster your OTUs besides the mention of clustering of chimera and singleton ASV reads? If so, why is it not mentioned in the methods?  The Good’s coverage was also not mentioned at all. Was any Good’s coverage calculations done? Or was there any other coverage done, such as chao1 or Shannon’s? Given that this study does use qPCR, that does help to better understand the microbiome as it quantifies the bacteria given instead of just stating the bacteria that is present. The sampling methods are well explained, but I do question if the fecal samples are accurate in determining the microbiome if you were unable to collect them after the race due to dehydration. Is one sample taken before the race sufficient enough to be able to ascertain the microbiome completely, or would there be missing information that could be important?  What did you filter for effective sample size? I think it would be helpful to go more in depth with the quality filtering that was done. Is a 50% completeness for MAGs high enough? When you mention normalizing the abundance for sequencing depth, how was this done? The flow of the paper is good, but the explanations in the methods section could be better. For example, the DNA sequencing steps are not thoroughly explained in this paper, and instead are referenced in other papers, making it difficult to know exactly what was done with the samples prior to extraction without having to go digging for the other papers.. Some questions on extraction can be made, specifically when it comes to the fecal samples. For an accurate depiction of the microbiome of the horses, I believe samples should have been taken before and after the races to understand any differences that might be seen prior to the races instead of what is just present before the race.  #SHSU5394",2022-03-22T23:10:37,,Adalia,10.1101/2022.01.24.477461,The first horse gut microbiome gene catalog reveals that rare microbiome ensures better cardiovascular fitness in endurance horses,"Núria Mach, Cédric Midoux, Sébastien Leclercq, Samuel Pennarun, Laurence Le Moyec, Olivier Rué, Céline Robert, Guillaume Sallé, Eric Barrey",2022-01-24
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.20.453110v3#comment-5802711163,biorxivstage,1,"This study is interesting in that it suggests that some of the unknown aspects of drug addiction could be attributed to the microbial community within the gut. The use of rats to model addiction was well designed with the employment of the increased electric shock with the increased self-administration of the drug. While looking at your methods for this study, I have a few suggestions that a reviewer might mention in the publication process. Firstly, the insertion of the catheter in the rats included flushings with a saline solution that contained antibiotics. It is unclear if these antibiotics were given throughout the course of the study or just initially during the insertion of the catheter. If there were any preliminary assays performed that showed what or if any changes occurred to the gut microbiome with the administration of the Cefazolin, they should be included in the study. Furthermore, you state that you performed 30 cycles of PCR. There are studies showing that an increase in cycles increases the likelihood of PCR errors, https://journals.asm.org/do.... If the study were to be repeated with fewer cycles, could it result in a similar population census? Just something to keep in mind. I would also suggest performing qPCR on the entire 16S gene to determine the initial abundances of the varying taxa. This real-time quantification is able to correlate the number of cycles with the number of amplicons to determine the initial abundance of the fragments in the sample. With regular fragmentation PCR, there is at best, an establishment of relative abundance. Were there any controls used during PCR and sequencing steps? It is ideal to run a simultaneous amplification and sequencing of known samples to determine if they were successful. These controls should be briefly mentioned during these procedures. As far as describing quality filtering of the amplicons, it would be prudent to specify what exactly is being filtered out, be it chimeras, PCR errors, etc. It is also important to state how many sequences were collected before and after this filtering so that it is apparent if the number of errors is what is to be normally expected. You show that you used QIIME, however, this is an older system and QIIME2 would be more up to date. It is unclear what the inclusion criteria are and what percent of the taxa found are considered in the study. It would be understandable to include the top 15 OTUs in the study, or to only include taxa that make up the majority of the population, so those taxa that are dominant. Also something to note would be what level of identification are you aiming to determine. In your figures, some of the taxa are inconsistently identified at either the genus, family, or order level. Greengenes is a database that is also not as up to date as others, and using a newer program could reveal better taxa ID, preferably species.  Alpha diversity is only briefly addressed and should be further examined by determining Shannon and Simpson’s indexes. When assessing the relative abundance of taxa based on 16S gene amplification, it is important to address those taxa that possess multiple copies of the 16S gene and adjust the abundance accordingly. Another important piece of information to include would be if you assessed sampling coverage. If you did not, it would be good to determine the Goods’ index of the sampling or Chao1 to compare to the number of OTUs found to assess coverage and richness of sample collected. The graphs in the supplemental figures appear to still be showing the generation of new OTUs, whereas if coverage is adequate, there would be a decrease in the number of new OTUs being established. If any of these processes or assays were further explored, the information should be added to the article. It is important to show not only exactly what was done to collect the data and analyze it, but also to verify the conclusions that are being made from the data. Studying any microbiome, especially that of the gut, brings with it much uncertainty. Many steps in the process can result in the loss of data or the introduction of errors, explaining all details in the study will contribute to the confidence in the results you present. #SHSU5394",2022-03-22T18:09:31,,Cheyenne,10.1101/2021.07.20.453110,The gut microbiome is associated with cocaine behavior and predicts addiction vulnerability in adult male rats,"Gregory J Suess, Jennysue Kasiah, Sierra Simpson, Molly Brennan, Dana Conlisk, Lisa Maturin, Olivier L George, Benoit Chassaing, Kyle J Frantz",2021-10-28

I do, however, have a few comments and questions on your study. First, you mention that you are studying the GMB of the fish. You describe this acronym as the gut emicrobiome; however, when I researched this acronym, I was unable to find anything. Is this a typo? Where could I find this information? Second, I was confused about the sample collection of the gar. How did the fishermen catch the fish, specifically what bait was used? Would this affect the gut microbiome of the gar? What food was fed to the fish grown in the lab? Were there significant differences in the GMB based on the collection method? Following that, you state that you squeeze the GMB; I am confused about how you obtained the feces. How did you squeeze the gut microbiome? Would this affect a change in the location? Would you be able to elaborate further on this? Next, while investigating your methods sections, I found some missing information in your PCR step. To improve your study and help end the replication crisis, I would add the PCR cycle number and temperature for this amplification. Thank you for including the variable region and specific primers you used. Finally, I read your sections on bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis and had a suggestion. When I first read the paper, I could not find your Good’s coverage and how you clustered the OTUs. I would move the information on how many clustered sequences and the similarity percentage right after removing the chimeras. Moreover, I was curious about an internal standard for sequencing and clustering analysis. I suggest adding a known strain you grew in the lab to the sample as to confirm that your sequences and binning are correct. Another suggestion would be to elaborate on why you adjusted the identity percentage to 99% with a coverage of 70%. Did this help with the phylogenetic analysis? Is this a quality control for the phylogenetic analysis similar to chimera removal? Overall, this study highlighted the gut microbiome of tropical gar and allowed for further research questions to be asked.

However, I do have a few questions and suggestions on the methods and materials section of your paper. First, fecal sample collection was mentioned but not the process of how the samples were collected. Was the feces collected after it passed from the monkey or was there some process to collect upper GI samples? The difference in collection methods may affect the presence of certain bacterial species, such as anaerobic species. Second, I did not see internal controls for DNA extraction, PCR, or the sequencing process. Were there any internal controls used to verify the results of each step? So, DNA extraction for example, known bacterial species grown in the lab can be included at specific concentrations and used to calculate how much DNA should be extracted from this known species, this way we can check to make sure the DNA extraction process worked as expected. Third, were there any steps taken to minimize PCR errors (such as ambiguous bases, etc.) and chimeras? It would be beneficial to mention these steps and what programs were used to minimize them in the materials and methods section, for example ChimeraSlayer is often used for removing chimeras. Also, it was mentioned that analysis was performed on samples after rarefaction to 10000 sequences/sample, but how many sequences/sample were there before this rarefaction? Last, in the Microbiota analysis section for 16S amplification, the link for the earth microbiome project does not seem to work for me. I apologize if this is an error on my end, but it says the page cannot be reached. Is there another way I can find this information? It may be beneficial to also include PCR steps and cycles you followed in the methods and materials section so that if anything ever happens to the link and it no longer works, you still have the steps you followed in the paper.

Now we can start to see evidence of what is really going on in the cochlea. Your work raises a whole lot of issues, but I’ll just mention a few key findings. I hope you find these comments helpful. 1. In the abstract a fairly provocative statement is that the data is not explained by current theories. In my view, I don’t think this is quite right, as the motions you reveal appear to be the result of simple resonance between the rows, an idea first raised in my PhD thesis and then in several associated publications. Perhaps the most germane are Bell & Fletcher (2004), The cochlear amplifier as a standing wave, JASA 116, 1016; https://doi.org/10.1121/1.1766053 and Bell (2012), A resonance approach to cochlear mechanics, PLOS One, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0047918. Both papers set out a scheme whereby the three rows of OHCs work together to establish a resonant element which gives rise to a standing wave between the rows. Tuning thus depends largely on the row spacing, not the stiffness of the BM. The OHCs are stimulated virtually instantaneously by the fast pressure wave (OHCs are pressure sensors, for which I’ve made a case elsewhere), not the conventional travelling wave. In this way, I think most of your findings can be accommodated, as set out below. 2. In your Introduction you say that a special sort of phasing is required in order to amplify the travelling wave. This is not necessary if you look at it in terms of resonance. As Bell (2012) broadly explains, the travelling wave is simply the observed result of what happens in response to a graded bank of highly tuned resonators that are almost simultaneously excited by a fast pressure wave. The delay observed is then simply Q/pi cycles, where Q is the tuning sharpness. In other words, I suggest you may be looking at things back-to-front causally: it is the resonance that gives rise to an apparent TW, not that the TW is a causal entity that, through very careful phasing, is able to amplify BM motion and give rise to a large peak! That is, the OHCs don’t amplify motion at all; instead they are pressure transducers which, via electromotility, vibrate in response to the sound pressure surrounding them (the OHCs contain pressure-sensitive ion channels). I’ve published a number of papers on this, and I’m happy to discuss the idea with you in more detail if you wish. In brief, I am suggesting that, if we look at cochlear mechanics differently, the TW is an epiphenomenon of a tuned bank of active elements. The elements are local oscillators – there doesn’t need to be global coupling in order to propagate a TW. 3. I am suggesting that each triplet of OHC1, OHC2, and OHC3 act together like a guitar string arranged radially. However, unlike a string, there is a fluid connection between the rows (a squirting wave) so that the wave travels at a particularly low velocity. Applied to your observations, at a BF of 46 kHz the wave traverses OHC1 to OHC3 (a distance of about 30 um) in 1/46000 of a second – that is, a speed of about 1 m/s. As an explanation, so-called squirting waves have such low phase velocities, and anatomically are well suited to act in the space between the TM and reticular lamina, as Bell & Fletcher (2004) describe. Electromotility of the OHCs causes squeezing in that space, generating squirting waves. 4. At their tuned frequency (BF), the amplitude of vibration is largest, and that is consistent with a resonating element that is tuned to that frequency. Thanks to your high resolution, we can see the activity of each of the three OHCs. In Figure 5c there seems to be a larger amplitude of vibration for RL3 than RL1; another radial profile at a different level (Figure 7c) shows that the amplitudes are about equal. Given the intricate geometry, I think that the findings are generally consistent with a radial standing wave with the OHCs at the antinodes. 5. Now, about the phases. The 3 OHCs seem to have about the same phase, and this is consistent with a standing wave between them. A standing wave is a wave that oscillates in time but whose profile of peak amplitude does not move in space. My papers suggest that OHC2 acts in antiphase to OHC1 and OHC3, an arrangement which is closer to a xylophone bar than a guitar string. In other words, each OHC sits at an antinode, and the result is a full-wavelength standing wave. Your OCT device sees all the OHCs vibrating at the same amplitude, but doesn’t see the wave moving backwards and forwards between them. Other phase arrangements may be possible, but the full wavelength case is probably the simplest. For a guitar string, there is only 1 antinode and 2 nodes, so if this applied in the cochlea, all the work would be done be OHC2 (we wouldn’t need 3 rows of OHCs). 6. Taking together all the above, I hope you may appreciate that if we had a ringing xylophone bar between OHC1 and OHC3 then an OCT device would see all the OHCs vibrating at the same amplitude and the same phase. It would require special techniques to detect the standing wave, and I wonder if your device has that capability. This would provide convincing evidence in favour of a resonance model. 7. Note that in my papers I regard the phase lag at resonance to reflect the group delay of the resonators. For a linear resonator, the group delay amounts to Q/pi cycles. It is interesting to look at the group delays you recorded in Figure 8f-h and Figure 10e,f. At BF (resonance) they show a phase lag of 2–3 cycles. So if one considers these delays to derive from a linear resonator (not strictly true, but perhaps not too far off), then the associated Q values would be pi times 2 or 3, which is about 6–9. Such Q values are roughly the same as those measured otoacoustically for the gerbil. In summary, I suggest it is possible to interpret your findings using a different causal chain, the inverse of what you have done. That is, the causal chain may involve the direct electromotility of OHCs in response to sound pressure, and not that OHCs have to very carefully amplify atomic-scale BM motions to create a traveling wave – and this approach simplifies cochlear mechanics enormously. The alternative view is that the BM may just be a supporting membrane for an array of tuned elements, which are independently excited by the fast pressure wave. Indeed, it is interesting that the ITER team (Khanna and colleagues) adopted this view more than 30 years ago. They said that “The present observations suggest that the outer hair cells vibrate mechanically along their axes in response to acoustical stimulation.” (p.188) https://doi.org/10.3109/00016488909138336. It is perfectly possible to look at your data in a different, but internally consistent, way. I hope this helps us move towards the truth of the matter. Best wishes for your publication.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.11.475783v1#comment-5789296069,biorxivstage,2,"The manuscript by Cuitun-Coronado et al. investigates the effects of circadian and diel cycles on the photosynthetic processes of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. The authors clarified three points: 1) they confirmed that M. polymorpha does display circadian regulation of several photosynthetic parameters; 2) they showed that light-dark cycles mask circadian cycles for these parameters; 3) by using a pharmacological approach, they showed that chloroplast translation is necessary for the circadian regulation of photosynthesis. The study fills a gap of knowledge in the circadian regulation of photosynthetic activity across evolution, by providing an additional link to what was known in cyanobacteria, microalgae, and vascular plants. It is original and  well-conducted. The interpretation and the discussion of the results is very convincing, and the conclusions are carefully drawn and backed up by the data. Major comments -	Page 7, lines 173-176: it is stated that the differences in period length observed between PAM and DF measurements might be due to differences in light intensity. How about light quality, as the PAM measurements were performed under blue light, vs. mixed red/blue for DF? -	Blue light, which was used in both types of experiments, has been shown to impact circadian rhythms in plants through the action of cryptochromes (e.g. Chaves et al., Annu. Rev. Plant Biol., 2011). Also, BL is responsible for chloroplast relocation responses, which is mediated by phototropins (e.g. see Kong et al. Plant and Cell Physiology, 2013). In Arabidopsis it can also impact plastid transcription through the intermediate of the blue-responsive plastid sigma factor SIG5 (Tsunoyama et al, FEBS Lett. 2002) and it is regulated by BL photoreceptors cryptochromes (Onda 2007, Plant Journal). Can you comment on these potential effects? Has their involvement in Marchantia polymorpha been investigated? Did they motivate your use of blue light for these experiments? -	Page 13, lines 316-323, please discuss the lack of effect on circadian rhythm by rifampicin: at first it may appear odd that translation has an effect but transcription doesn’t. Could it be due to rifampicin only inhibiting PEP and transcription by NEP compensates? -	Page 14, lines 354-363: 1)	Is there a reason why you performed light curves with increasing light intensity up to 789 µmol m-2 s-1 if you end up using only the data with light intensity closer to growth conditions (108 µmol m-2 s-1)? 2)	Could the 20 minutes of dark-adaptation every two hours and increasing light intensity up to 789 µmol m-2 s-1 have affected the circadian rhythms of plants that were supposed to be at constant LL? This experimental setup could be considered as fluctuating light condition. Please discuss whether this may have an effect on the observed results. Minor comments -	Page 2, lines 27-28, ""the circadian regulation of several measures of photosynthetic biochemistry (delayed fluorescence, the rate of photosynthetic electron transport, and non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence)"": please rephrase this sentence as it seems that the circadian regulation has an effect on the measurements themselves while they are tools to see something happening at photosynthetic levels. We suggest replacing it with ""circadian regulation affects photosynthesis performances, detectable by several photosynthetic parameters such as delayed fluorescence, the rate of photosynthetic electron transport, and non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence"". Same can be applied in Pages 4-5, lines 98-99. -	Page 4, lines 84-90, this sentence is very long and difficult to read, please rephrase and split it into at least two sentences for better readability and clarity. -	Page 5, lines 114-118, discussion might be a better place for this. -	Page 5, line 118, please replace ""Features of PAM fluorescence"" with ""Features of chlorophyll fluorescence as measured by PAM"" as the first indicates a specific method to measure an intrinsic phenomena (Chl fluo) and it is not the only one for Chl fluo measurements. -	Page 5, line 123, please replace ""PAM metrics"" with ""prompt fluorescence"" for consistency with DF, named just before. -	Page 6, lines 126-127, to be consistent with the nomenclature, ""LL"" should be ""low light"", not ""constant light"". Consider replacing LL with CLL (""constant low light"") since the plants are actually exposed to a lower light compared to the standard growth light described in materials and methods. Also, please include in the description of the light conditions “LD” together with its full name (which is directly mentioned before in line 138 without its full name ""light-dark cycles""). -	Pages 6-7, lines 152-154, this sentence is more technical and it does not seem necessary to understand and interpret the results described later. Please consider moving this sentence in Material and methods to keep the results section more readable. -	Page 7, lines 167-172, please provide a reason why photosynthetic activity was measured only under LL and not also in the other two conditions described for DF. -	Page 8, lines 196-199, reading the text it seems you used only T24 and T28. Please list all the T lengths (T20, T22, T24 and T28) as reported in Figure 3 legend. -	Page 10, line 254, please add a short sentence to briefly comment the results obtained with the rifampicin treatment. -	Page 13, lines 316-318, ""Perhaps inhibiting the expression of these proteins prevents or reduces PSII repair, which disrupts circadian cycles of the rate of electron transport by interfering with the electron transport process"". Please rephrase this sentence, as it is written it can be interpreted as defective PSII repair disrupts circadian cycles. -	Page 13, line 335, describe conditions of its natural habitat “such as”. -	Page 14, lines 341, in the growth conditions you describe that the standard light conditions used were 100 μmol photons m-2 s-1 of white light. Is there a reason why for the DF experiment described in this manuscript you decided to use 60 µmol m-2 s-1? -	Page 18, legend of Figure 1: line 421, “thallus” should be “thalli”; “light/cycles” should read “light/dark cycles”. -	Line 430, define FFT-NLLS. -	Please move the definition of RAE from lines 433-434, to its first occurrence line 430. -	Line 433, define SEM. -	Page 19, line 470, please write SEM instead of s.e.m., for consistency with the legend of Figure 1. -	Figure 1: the figure is very big and can create confusion, please consider to split it in two figures, e.g. a-f Figure1 and g-k Figure 2. -	In the legend, include the abbreviations for the light conditions and correct ""ligh/cycles"" with ""light-dark cycles"" as reported in the text. -	Panel g. Please better describe this panel, especially the colours meaning in the clock. -	Figure 1 (a,c,e) 2 and Figure 4: the alternance of white and light grey bands to mark the 12h periods can be very easily misinterpreted as light/dark cycles. To clarify and display the constant light conditions at a glance, please consider using another means to evidence them, such as dashed lines. -	Figure 4: similarly to Figure 1, this figure is very large and hard to read. Consider splitting it. -	Please write the concentrations of lincomycin and rifampicin in the relevant panels, as the different shades are difficult to distinguish and understand in panels a-d, g-j, m-p and s-v. -	Panels f-l and r-x: please use the same scale on the y axis, or, if not possible, bring attention of the reader to the different scale in the figure legend. At first, we were puzzled by the ‘no-treatment’ not starting from similar amplitudes.

I'm very interested to see how the different distance metrics behave in real life settings.
