I was delighted to come across your article, and the experience of reading it has been truly remarkable. It has been a rewarding endeavor to contemplate potential alternatives and novel experiments that could further enhance the significance of your work. I hope that you receive this message and find value in these collaborative insights. The lncRNA Sweetheart regulates compensatory cardiac hypertrophy after myocardial injury. In the elegant study by Rogala et al., they demonstrated that the expression of the long non-coding RNA ""sweetheart RNA"" (Swhtr), which is expressed in the same region as the crucial transcription factor Nkx2-5, exerts favorable effects on both cardiac function and morphology in animals subjected to left anterior descending artery ligation (LAD). The Swhtr lncRNA is chromatin-localized, and although its deletion does not induce cardiac structural changes during embryonic phases or fetal lethality, nor yield structural or functional cardiac modifications in adulthood, its recovery in transgenic animals induced an enhancement in cardiac morphology and function following myocardial infarction induced by LAD surgery. Although its precise function remains undefined, this manuscript suggests its influence on genes associated with the NKX2-5 transcription factor. Major 1- I found the introduction to be quite engaging. However, enhancing the overall coherence of the work could involve establishing a more explicit connection between collagen deposition, scar formation, and fibrosis within the context of a myocardial infarction model. Addressing this interrelationship in the introduction would be particularly advantageous, given its enduring significance over time, as opposed to the relatively less prevalent occurrence of compensatory hypertrophy. 2- In the study conducted by Werber et al. (2014), the group generated a comprehensive dataset elucidating the transcriptional landscape of cardiac tissue. Notably, they identified a specific RNA molecule that exhibits exclusive expression within the heart tissue context. Conversely, in the context of the present research, the rationale behind investigating the lncRNA Swhtr appears to lack clarity Establishing a logical connection with the Nkx2-5 factor could potentially serve to justify the selection of the lncRNA under investigation. This strategic link could bolster the rationale for studying lncRNA Swhtr and its potential relevance within the broader context of cardiac biology. 3- I appreciate the researchers' elegant approach in illustrating the spatial distribution of lncRNA across diverse embryonic stages. Nevertheless, I am left wondering whether the researchers considered expanding their analysis to encompass additional developmental stages, such as the newborn (NB) phase. This query stems from the findings highlighted in the current study, where the NB phase emerges as the highest lncRNA window expression and, conceivably, a pivotal period of heightened lncRNA activity (Bridges et al., 2021; Gomes et al., 2017). Remarkably, this pattern aligns with the outcomes derived from Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) analyses conducted on cultured cardiac cells (Fig. 1H). Thus, contemplating lncRNA dynamics during the newborn phase could offer valuable insights into its plausible functional roles and accentuate its significance within the intricate framework of cardiac biology. 4- In figures 3A-F, the inclusion of a Sham WT control group would be highly valuable. While I recognize the challenges associated with conducting additional experiments for a new group, the incorporation of Sham animals could substantially enhance the interpretability of the results. Specifically, the comparison between disease-induced (LAD) effects on both WT and KO (Swhtr3x/pA3xpA) groups and their corresponding Sham WT counterparts would offer insightful insights into survival rates and cardiac function data. For instance, the introduction of a Sham WT group could illuminate noteworthy differences in ejection fraction. It is conceivable that the KO animals subjected to LAD would exhibit a potentially significant reduction in ejection fraction when contrasted with the healthy Sham WT group. In contrast, both the WT and Transgenic animals may not display statistically significant deviations from the Sham WT group, thereby accentuating the therapeutic benefits conferred by the treatment. Incorporating a Sham WT control group would contribute significantly to the robustness of the findings, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of the treatment's efficacy and its impact on cardiac function under both normal and disease conditions. 5- I believe that a more comprehensive characterization of the animals subjected to LAD would greatly enrich the study. Showing fibrosis and hypertrophy could lead to more holistic understanding of the animals' phenotype. Also, presenting the expressions of specific collagen types, particularly collagen III, which typically manifests in the initial weeks following an infarction, would help. This additional analysis would provide a deeper insight into the fibrotic response triggered by the myocardial infarction and contribute to a comprehensive appreciation of the tissue remodeling process. Furthermore, the inclusion of molecular markers associated with cardiac hypertrophy would be a significant asset to the study. 6- Extending the observation period for animals subjected to LAD and tracking them until the development of heart failure would offer a comprehensive perspective on morphological and functional cardiac changes over time. This longitudinal approach holds the promise of uncovering the dynamic role of the identified lncRNA in disease progression, providing valuable insights into its potential as a modulator or indicator of pathological processes associated with heart failure. 7- An elegant dimension could be added to the study if the researchers were to explore the effects of lncRNA Swthr deletion and gain of function in alternate models of hypertrophy. Considering the potential role of this lncRNA in governing cardiac hypertrophy, examining its impact on both pathological and physiological hypertrophic scenarios could yield valuable insights. Employing the transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model for inducing pathological hypertrophy would provide a robust hypertrophic stimulus, while unveiling the lncRNA's effects in physiological hypertrophy through aerobic exercise sessions would establish a nuanced connection between hypertrophy modulation and lncRNA activity. By encompassing these distinct scenarios, the study could present a comprehensive perspective on lncRNA's role in different hypertrophic contexts, thereby enhancing our understanding of its regulatory influence on cardiac adaptation. 8- The utilization of cardiac tissue culture is indeed an intriguing aspect of the study. Expanding this approach, perhaps in future studies, to encompass diverse infarction zones, including border and remote areas, would not only enhance the study's sophistication but also provide invaluable insights into the nuanced RNA profile characteristics of distinct zones adapting to the pathological stimulus. Moreover, performing an RNA expression profile analysis within the hearts of transgenic animals subjected to LAD holds promise in uncovering potential gene alterations and regulatory effects mediated by the lncRNA. This multifaceted exploration could unravel a comprehensive landscape of gene expression changes triggered by the lncRNA, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of its intricate role in the cardiac response to myocardial infarction. Minor - I believe it would be important to use Medical Subject Headings for the keywords, I suggest: Cardiac hypertrophy, long non-coding RNA, myocardial infarction. - In figures 1C-E the researchers interestingly use the lacZ reporter technique. It would be interesting and necessary to present the technique used in the methods. - The sentence to describe Swhtr labeling in heart and other tissue was a bit confusing and could be improved in clarity (line 199-122). - In Figure 1F, I believe there was a significant difference; if possible, provide the statistical symbol. Also in figure F, did the authors use any housekeeping gene to correct the expression? I think it would be more interesting to show the relative expression versus the absolute. - During the manuscript, Swhtr and Swhtr lncRNA are used, I particularly think the name followed by lncRNA is more elegant. - I believe that if the 1G figure were presented with separate bars, it will make the result much easier to understand. - I believe it would make the text easier to understand if 3G figure were moved to position 3B - It would be very interesting to demonstrate in figure 3H, in addition to the knock-out and Tg, also the LAD surgery and the time course. - Line 218, I think you addressed the wrong image (is it 3G?). - In the methods it would be important to define the term ES cells and mESCs (Embryonic stem cells) (line 342); Line 415, 465, 466, 467 use qPCR as in the rest of manuscript. It would be important to state in the manuscript how much tissue or cells were used for RNA extraction. It would also be nice to tell in the body of the text the time it took to extract the tissues, they are described in the methods, but I believe that it would enhance the work by being close to the results.

The manuscript ""Adaptation of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Transcriptome to Biofilm Growth"" delves into the intricate variations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transcription patterns. It uncovers disparities between the ancestral L4 strains and those exposed to selective pressure for biofilm formation. This previously unexplored phenomenon holds potential insights into host interactions, making it a compelling avenue for comprehending disease pathogenesis. MAJOR POINTS: ** This preprint represents a continuation of the research group's prior study published in 2022. Within this work, the researchers skillfully leverage transcriptomics techniques to illuminate the intricate irregularities that govern biofilm formation in mycobacteria. The employed methodologies not only establish a robust foundation but also showcase a meticulously outlined methodology. However, it's noteworthy that the text's structure occasionally reintroduces specific passages in both the results and recommendations sections. A potential benefit to the text could be achieved by addressing and eliminating these redundancies. ** The introduction and discussion lack information describing mycobacteria and biofilms in general. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), for example, are well described in terms of their ability to form biofilm. These environmental and opportunistic organisms represent a problem for water treatment systems and in the hospital environment. ** The discussion about phenotypic variation is superficially described. A more thorough discussion of this phenomenon can contribute to the findings. ** As described, MMMC duplication has already been observed by other authors. Under which growth conditions has this been seen? Does this corroborate or contrast from the point of view of biofilm formation? ** The origin of the strains is not exactly clear. The strains chosen deserve a brief description of the patients from whom they were collected and their pathogenesis. In addition, was any characterization performed on the resistance profile of the strains? The relationship between biofilms and susceptibility should be further explored.

The study analyses genome-wide DNA methylation and differential gene expression in the initial generation (heat-stressed and control) and their three subsequent non-stressed asexual generations. The authors observed a decreasing transfer of the stress-induced molecular memory across the generations. Their work has originality/novelty, and we believe the biological question they seek to answer can be interesting for the plant sciences community. We would like to provide some suggestions which we believe might enhance the quality of the manuscript. Please be aware that these suggestions are not exhaustive. Major comments •	Please include additional information so as to allow the research to be replicable and reproducible. For example, saying “9:00-11:00 a.m.” might not be precise enough. Using the specific light zeitgeber would better inform when samples were harvested in the diel cycle (lines 140 and 161). Another example, the description “Illumina paired end read sequencing (150 bp)” appears to omit crucial details concerning the specific options utilised in the NGS experiment. Important information, such as mRNA selection method, library construction kit, sequencing platform, and the strand-specificity of reads, among other factors, should be included. Line 192: Please state which transcriptome was used with Salmon. Line 282: Which clustering method was used to build the heatmaps? •	The claim that “… genes linked to gibberellin pathways may contribute to a short transcriptional memory.” should be discussed with the literature. •	Line 642-644: Kindly review the claim in relation to what is depicted in the figure. Minor comments •	We recommend English editing to enhance grammar and clarity. •	Scientific names must always be italicised. In the first appearance of the species, it is also required to list the person (or team) who first made the scientific name of that taxon available. •	Lines 131, 134 and 144: could you please add the light intensity in µmol m-2 s-1? •	Line 135: Is there a specific scientific or practical rationale for maintaining consistent temperatures in stress assays throughout both day and night, while implementing varying diel thermos-cycles for control and recovery conditions? •	Line: 158: We found it a bit difficult to understand what was actually collected. •	Line 166: please, add the reference where we can find more details on the bisulfide method used. •	Line 193: It would make it easier for the reader to understand what the authors mean by DEG if the DESeq2 default parameters were described here. Is it log-fold change, p-value cut-off, etc? •	Lines 205-207: Could you provide information on the duration of the heat-stress treatments? •	Lines 264-267: Do terms like ""low,"" ""hypermethylation,"" and ""hypomethylation"" refer to a comparison with data from control samples? The comparison between different samples was not really clear to us. The same applies to “significantly different” (line 281). •	Figure 1A: We think this figure could be improved to help the reader understand the temperatures used for CM. Additionally, could you confirm whether the application of 24°C on recovery days precisely occurred for 48 hours? It seems that the temperature might not be exactly 24°C, and we think the figure could provide more precise details. •	Figure 1B: Why are scissors, “2w” and “sampling” shown only on the right-hand side of the figure? •	Figure 1C: Detecting differences among samples based on the y-axis is proving to be challenging for us. The authors might want to contemplate plotting by C contexts on the x-axis, or alternatively, segmenting the y-axis into three distinct regions where resolution could be enhanced around 1-5, 13-17, and 38-42. •	Figure 3B: Is it possible to apply colour shading similar to that seen in a heatmap for this figure? •	Figure 3D: Kindly review the genes mentioned in the figure legend in relation to what is depicted in the figure. •	Line 280-281: The phrase between the brackets seems a bit confusing. We recommend rephrasing it for clarity. •	It might be advisable for the authors to verify whether they are employing a colour-blind-friendly palette. •	Some of the finer details in the figures are quite challenging to discern, making it difficult to interpret the results. •	The expression patterns of several FvHSFs were described previously (López et al., 2022), some also undergoing promoter demethylation. How does the expression patterns of these HSFs change in response to a temperature gradient challenge? We believe the paper would considerably improve if heat-shock proteins and chaperones are also investigated.",2023-08-21T17:16:09,cristianepaulagomescalixto,Cristiane Paula Gomes Calixto,10.1101/2023.05.26.542514,Epigenetic and transcriptional landscape of heat-stress memory in woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca),"María-Estefanía López, Béatrice Denoyes, Etienne Bucher",2023-05-29

This is a logical inference, however the authors' description of ISRIB's mechanism of action is factually incorrect: ISRIB acts downstream of phosphorylated eIF2 to interfere with downstream signalling (this critical event requires binding of ISRIB to eIFB); ISRIB does not impair eIF2 phosphorylation, as stated in the article. This point was established in the very first description of ISRIB (Sidrauski et al. 2013, PMID: 23741617) and elaborated on further by the 2015 publication cited as a reference here.

First, it's wrong to write that scDblFinder is ""formerly known as doubletCells"". They're two methods developed independently, and it's simply that doubletCells was moved to the same package, but still as an independent method. Second, your results are in contrast with other benchmarks, which you explain by more ""realistic scRNA-seq datasets"". I'm obviously not entirely disinterested here, but I think this is very misleading: you don't show any evidence that the traditional benchmark datasets do have unrealistic patient or batch effects, and omit to mention the critical fact that, as far as I know, the fatemap samples are homogeneous cell lines, which is far from being more realistic (people do scRNAseq on complex tissues much more often than on cell lines). I think a fairer description would be to abandon the ""realistic/unrealistic"" labels, describe your data as it is, and hence that your observations are basically about homotypic doublets, which the tested methods are very bad at detecting (but also don't claim to do). The lack of real difference between adjacent/distant seems to indicate pretty clearly that you're essentially dealing with homotypic doublets.",2023-08-16T13:06:21,pierrelucgermain,Pierre-Luc Germain,10.1101/2023.08.04.552078,singletCode: synthetic barcodes identify singlets in scRNA-seq datasets and evaluate doublet algorithms,"Ziyang Zhang, Madeline E.

Preface: We thank the reviewers for their interest in our work and for the thoughtful, clearly-organized, and fair feedback. Besides increasing the reproducibility and rigor of our work, the points raised by the reviewers led us to explore previously-overlooked aspects of our study, revealing new insights with significant implications for future studies. In a field that moves at a break-neck pace, this form of feedback is invaluable for optimizing the rate of discovery and the accuracy of the findings. In this response, we address each of the major points raised in the review. We reference a set of figures and a table that were prepared to address points raised by the reviewers. Unfortunately, these figures cannot be shared in text-only forms, but we have hosted them in a public repository, accessible at this link: https://github.com/GMdSilva..., which also includes all the raw data referenced in this response. Response: Major points: 1.0. The MSA subsampling approach that the authors have adapted in this work has been used by others previously (as cited by the authors themselves), albeit with some modifications. So it is important to see if the existing methodologies, for instance the DBSCAN based clustering and MSA subsampling by Wayment-Steele et al., are able to predict these relative state populations of variants. R: We agree that these comparisons would be important, especially in the context of benchmarking and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Although we thought of running a few comparisons with the DBSCAN method, we ultimately decided to focus our study on showcasing the results of our approach in the context of the two test cases instead of as a comparison with previous methods. We are very curious to see how our results line up with results from alternative methods and are happy to assist other groups with further studies by sharing our data or running predictions. 1.1. Also, the optimization of max_seq:extra_seq requires quite a bit of pre-existing experimental information. How is this method to be applied for a relatively new system? The authors could also provide some guidelines on how the max_seq:extra_seq numbers to be sampled are c0hosen and in general comment about the hyper-parameter space in their approach and how it compares to other schemes/approaches. R: This is an excellent point, which could have been more thoroughly addressed in our current manuscript and will be in subsequent versions. While our approach is best suited for the high-throughput exploration of the effects of changes in previously-explored systems, we argue that our method can also stud mostly unknown (in the context of structural or dynamics data) systems. To accomplish this, a user should first identify structural elements with significant conformational variation within the predicted ensemble (such as by calculating the root mean square fluctuation of alpha carbons within the ensemble when aligned with the prediction of the highest-ranking pLDDT, or more easily by evaluating per-residue pLDDT values, as lower pLDDT values are usually correlated with increased dynamics, see Figure 1’A for an example of this correlation.) Following that, the user could plot the RMSD of that specific region for each prediction with respect to the highest-ranking (by average pLDDT) reference, and either analyze the distribution visually or via statistical methods. This approach works exceptionally well for Abl1. The A-loop is the structural element with the largest amplitude of conformational changes in the ensemble, as evidenced in Figure 1’A. By plotting the A-Loop backbone RMSD with respect to the top-ranked prediction for each prediction within the Abl1 ensemble, we clearly identify patterns across the parameter optimization process. Specifically, we see that the distributions of predictions as a function of RMSD are similar and cluster around the ground state for the most extreme parameter values (32:64 and 2048:4096), but become increasingly wider and more diverse for intermediate parameter values(256:512 and 512:1024), where we observe an increased number of samples around 14 A. For Abl1, we already know the implications of these observations in regards to its structure and function, but in the absence of previous information, it would be reasonable to infer that the cluster at ~14 A represents a metastable conformation of lower population than the ground state and that the predictions that lie in-between them (more diverse in 256:512 and 512:1024) could represent low-occupancy intermediate states. Consequently, in systems for which there is limited information, choosing parameters that lead to the widest distribution of configurations and the largest number of intermediate predictions between two or more states of interest should lead to optimal results, without the need for experimental data. 2.0. Apart from the large change in A-loop from active to inactive state in Abl kinase, the other important structure change involves the 𝛼C helix moving out (as shown in Reference 22 cited in the preprint). The authors have not discussed this aspect. Does the AF2 subsampled ensemble reflect the change in the helix position? R: We agree with the reviewers that looking at aC helix conformations is important, and regret that we neglected it when writing the original manuscript. In response to this suggestion, we calculated the RMSD of the aC Helix backbone (residues 275-295) with respect to both the Ground and I2 state references (6XR6 and 6XRG, respectively) for each ensemble of wild-type Abl1 predictions at different subsampling labels, in the same way we did for the activation loop and plotted the results in figure 2’A. Importantly, we see a distribution of results that is strikingly similar to the activation loop results (Figure 1’A). When plotting these variables against each other (Figure 2’B), we observe clear clustering corresponding to Ground-like and I2-like states, suggesting that AF2 is not predicting just the activation loop conformational changes, but the aC-helix movement as well. This pattern holds for mutant forms of Abl1 (mutations that decrease the ground state population lead to predictions with increased aC-Helix motions and an increased frequency of predictions different than the ground state;an opposite effect is observed for those that increase the ground state population, as summarized in Figure 2’B). In summary, our approach accurately identifies that aC-Helix and A-loop motions are correlated in our ensemble of predictions, and can be used individually or in tandem to distinguish between conformational states. 2.1. The snapshots shown from enhanced MD does not seem to show this change either (upon visual examination of the snapshots shown in the figures). Hence, the biological relevance of the MD simulation becomes questionable. R: We thank the reviewers for bringing this to our attention. We do observe the aC-Helix shifting from its initial position in our simulations, but due to a labeling error while making Figure 4 of the original manuscript, we miscommunicated the scope of our results, leading to the impression that there is no change in the aC-Helix position (which is also not helped by the camera angle of the structural renderings we included in the figure, which makes it hard to discern changes in the helix position). As described in the supporting information, we ran two separate enhanced-sampling simulations using the Weighted Ensemble method to determine the timescales of the Ground to  I2 transition. This led to two representative trajectories: Simulation I spanning 13 ns corresponding to the Ground to I1 (DFG flip) transition, and Simulation II spanning 24 ns corresponding to the I1 to I2 (A-Loop collapse) transition. In Figure 4, we took snapshots from the I1 to I2 state simulation (in contrast with the Ground to I2 simulation, as erroneously labeled in the paper), since the activation loop transition happens within that interval. At 0 ns for simulation II, the aC-Helix is already slightly shifted with respect to its ground state position, as some of the aC-Helix conformational change happens in the Ground to I1 transition. Since the shown snapshots are all from the I1 to I2 transition, Figure 4 in the manuscript doesn’t accurately communicate aC-Helix conformational changes. We will remedy this oversight by adjusting the language in the figure and related discussions in the text. Further, for the sake of clarity, we demonstrate in Figure 3 that our collated trajectory (II appended to the end of I) captures the aC-Helix moving away from the kinase core. We have also updated the original plots to include the entire 37 ns simulation (Figure 3’B). Lastly, we also noticed an error regarding the time points at which snapshots were collected and adjusted the vertical bars to represent the actual time points from which they were taken. We will rework Figure 4 with the correct timestamp labels for each snapshot in a future version of the manuscript. For the sake of transparency, our collated trajectory (solvent and ions removed) is available at https://github.com/GMdSilva..., and the topology at: https://github.com/GMdSilva.... 3. The authors haven’t performed statistical analyses on the RMSD comparisons or the CSP comparisons of GMCSF to claim the differences to be significant or not. For example, the authors say their approach has worked “as the range of the distribution of RMSDs of residues 80-90 and 110-125 is significantly larger for most of the mutations tested at both of these sites”. What is this distribution of RMSD compared against? Are these differences statistically significant? R: We thank the reviewers for bringing this to our attention and realize in hindsight that the text could be clearer regarding this comparison. We are comparing to the wild-type prediction that looks the most like the ground state, defined as the conformation occupied by PDB ID: 1CSG. We used the Kruskal-Wallis H-test to measure the significance of the differences we observe in the GMCSF distributions and report them in Table ‘1. This test was chosen because it is unlikely that RMSD values will follow a normal distribution considering the nature of energy landscapes (which are more likely to exhibit multimodal distributions). These results line up with our previous observations: the H83Y predictions led to statistically insignificant differences, while the H87 mutations lead to differences that are orders of magnitude less significant than H83 or H15 mutations. The H83N mutation also led to changes that are not as statistically significant as those induced by H83R, matching the observed NMR results. The raw data used in the Kruskal-Wallis H-test is available at: https://github.com/GMdSilva... 4. Given that GMCSF has very limited sequence data in MSA to start with, does MSA subsampling actually help? The authors could try doing predictions using the traditional AF2 pipeline and compare those distributions against their approach. R: Although this is not made clear in our results, we did run GMCSF without subsampling, and show the results in Figure S8. Specifically, since the length of the GMCSF MSA is only about 120 sequences, any of the subsampling runs with max_seq and extra_seq values greater than 120 are, in essence, using the traditional AF2 pipeline (with drop-offs enabled) as there is no subsampling employed. We still included these results for the sake of transparency, but in a future version of this manuscript, we will be clearer about this distinction and what it means with respect to the effects of subsampling. Minor points: 1. Although the authors are right in looking for only the ground and I2 states in Abl kinase predictions, it will be interesting to explore if there were any predictions that matched the I1 state and if not, to speculate why more extensively R. Originally, when conceptualizing this study, we did look at I1 state similarities, but the results were inconclusive and hard to make sense of, so we dropped that from the scope of the work. However, when looking at the data now, it is clear that AF2 is predicting I1-like elements in each ensemble, although the resolution of those predictions is significantly lower than that for the I2 predictions. Specifically, the I1 state is mostly defined by a flip of the position of the side chains of D381 and F382, part of the DFG motif. In the ground state, D381 points towards the active site and F382 points towards the aC-Helix, allowing productive phosphorylation. In the I1 state, these side-chain positions are inverted, and F382 occludes the active site. Previous studies have shown that two dihedrals clearly distinguish between the four potential permutations of the DFG motif side-chain orientations: D in/F in (DFG in), D out/F out (DFG out), D out/F in (DFG up), and D in/F out (DFG down). The dihedrals are defined as follows: Dihedral 1: A380CB/A380CA/D381CA/D381/CG Dihedral 2: A380CB/A380CA/F382CA/F382/CG In the Ground to I1 transition, dihedrals 1 and 2 invert. The DFG up and DFG down configurations are short-lived in Abl1 and are usually only observed in MD simulations (where femtosecond resolution is feasible). When plotting dihedrals 1 and 2 for our ensemble of predictions (Figure 4’), we observe a curious behavior for dihedral 1: the distribution is strongly bimodal, with two clearly-defined clusters, one at the expected position for dihedral 1 in the Ground state, and one much less populated cluster situated around 20-40 degrees. Although the latter is nowhere near the values expected of the dihedral 1 position in I2 (about -120 to -140), the fact that there is clustering at this position and that the cluster populations mimic that of the Ground and I1/I2 populations suggests that AF2 is picking up some amount of dynamical signal that corresponds to the Ground to I1 transition, although the signal is not strong enough and/or AF2’s resolution is not high enough to correctly replicate the expected result. Even more interestingly, the population of this D “out” cluster is increased in mutations known to dislocate the conformational equilibrium away from the ground state and decreased in mutations known to have the opposite effect (although with very low statistical power), similar to what is observed in the A-Loop or aC-Helix conformational predictions (Figure 5’). This suggests that the dihedral 1 position is correlated with A-loop and aC-Helix conformations in the predictions, which is in agreement with the defining elements of the I1 and I2 states. Finally, analyzing the distribution of dihedral 2 leads to significantly murkier results, as the swarm plot takes a comet form with a single largely-populated cluster at the expected values for the F-in conformation, and a few predictions that deviate from it up to -160 (which is also significantly far from the expected F-out values of 40 to 60). Interestingly, the population of the “outlier” predictions negatively correlates with the ground state population for the Abl1 allelic series. These results hint that there could be more coevolutional signal for the D381 flip than for the F382 flip, which corroborates MD simulation results that show that it is mostly D381 interactions that drive the entire DFG flip. 2. The data on some of the max_seq:extra_seq optimizations discussed for Abl kinase is missing. For example, 512:8 or 8:1024 R: The text is supposed to say 32:512 and 512:32 (matching Figure 5), but we neglected to change placeholder values for the data that were included in a previous figure. 3. There is no citation provided for the single and double mutants whose relative ground state populations were tested for Abl Kinase. R: The relevant citation is #22: Xie, T., Saleh, T., Rossi, P. & Kalodimos, C. G. Conformational states dynamically populated by a kinase determine its function. Science 370 (Oct. 2020). We reference it in this specific context in the caption of Figure 6: “(B) A series of point mutations in wild-type Abl1 are known to increase or decrease the relative population of the enzyme’s active (ground) state [22].” We will add a reference to the main text and to Figure S2 for improved clarity. 4. The nature of these mutations on Abl Kinase is not discussed. Are some of these mutations pathogenic or drug-resistant? It will be interesting to correlate the nature of mutation with its structural effects. The authors could provide more introduction of how these mutations were identified and add more discussion on trends. R: Three of the mutations that increase the ground-state population are associated with type II inhibitor resistance in Abl1 (E255K, T315I, E255K+T315I). All mutations were chosen due to the extensive data regarding their effects on the populations of the Ground or I2 state (Kalodimos et al., Science 2020; Kern et al, PNAS 2020). We agree with the reviewers that correlating the nature of mutations with structural effects has important implications, especially in the case of the mutations that lead to drug resistance. Our running hypothesis is that reduced affinity to type II inhibitors is caused by the further stabilization of the Ground state caused by the mutations E255K, T315I, and E255K+T315I, as type II inhibitors have a strong preference for the I2 form of Abl1. We will discuss these implications in more detail in a revised version of the manuscript. 5. What is the rationale behind choosing the PCs mentioned by the authors for Abl kinase enhanced sampling? R: Ground to I1 simulation: PC1:  Based on the observation by the D. E. Shaw Research group that protonated D381 forms a transient hydrogen bond with V299 in an unbiased DFG flip (Shaw et al., PNAS 2009). PC2.  Based on a metadynamics collective variable used in a DFG flip study of the Aurora Kinase B (Li et al, AAPS J. 2019). This PC2 allows for differentiation between DFG-out and DFG-up (PC1 is not sufficient for that, although it is sufficient to sample the flip). I1 to I2 simulation: PC1: Chosen based on visual inspection of two atoms defining a distance that should increase during the I1 to I2 transition. PC2: Chosen based on visual inspection of two atoms defining a distance that should decrease during the I1 to I2 transition. 6. Why have the authors not shown the RMSD distribution of Distance 2 in Figure 4C? R: We made the decision to not show the distribution of the Distance 2 deltas in Figure 4C because the resulting plot was cluttered when using the same figure aesthetics as the other distributions (Figure 6’), and we thought it to be largely redundant considering the other elements in the figure. We included the Distance 2 delta data in its entirety in Figures S2-5. 7. How were the mutations on the histidine triad of GMCSF chosen? Sebollela et al. 2005 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih..., which is not cited in this paper specifically but cited in one of the papers (Cui et al. 2020 - https://doi.org/10.1021/acs... that this paper cites, substitutes H15 with alanine to demonstrate a decrease in heparin affinity R: The mutations were chosen based on sequence conservation data of GMCSF. Specifically, positions 15, 83, and 87 are mostly conserved as histidine, but some species tolerate mutations to asparagine, arginine, or tyrosine. We did not test the alanine substitution as that leads to a protein with poor expression. 8. For the GMCSF system, do the authors see a relationship between the plDDT scores and the extent of RMSD? R: Yes. We are conducting further measurements for a potential follow-up study, but predictions that significantly deviate from the ground state reference have significantly lower average pLDDTs than those that mostly replicate the ground state. The amplitude of this change is reduced for some mutations, which we hypothesize is due to the alternative-conformation-stabilizing effect of these mutations. 9. Prior work that uses AF2 to sample conformational ensembles has seen that AF2 is able to predict more diverse conformations when the protein is not part of AF2’s training dataset. Was GMSCF part of the training dataset? If yes, how would the author’s approach vary for a protein that is not part of the training dataset? R: Yes. GMCSF is a part of the training dataset as the crystal structures that were solved for it were deposited before 2018 (1CSG, 2GMF, 5C7X, among others). We are measuring/honing our approach in proteins that were not part of the training dataset and will publish the results in a public repository once this analysis is finished. 10. Some of the figures are not informative/important enough to be main figures. For example, Figure 2 is mainly the AF2 pipeline, Figure 5 is just a pictorial representation of Supplementary Table S1. Also, Figures 6 and 7 could be combined into a single figure. R: We agree with this assessment and will remove redundancies in a future version of this manuscript. 11. The CSP data for H15N is not shown in Figure 9B whereas its RMSD is shown in Figure 9C R: There is no CSP data for H15N at the time of publication of the pre-print or of this review response, because of challenges with expressing this mutant. We made the decision to include the prediction data for the sake of transparency and completeness. Accordingly, we don’t make any assessments regarding the precision of the H15N predictions and don’t count them when calculating accuracy rates. We will upload an amended version of Figure 9 when GMSCF H15N data is collected. Figure 9B compares the RMSD of each mutant ensemble to the wild-type, ground state structure. 12. The cut-off values used for jackhmmer not mentioned. R: We used the default jackhmmr Significance E-values as cut-off values (0.01 for Sequence, 0.03 for hit). 13. Residues are being addressed as codons in some places in the text R: We will fix these inconsistencies in a future version of this manuscript. 14. The authors may also want to include a few sentences contrasting their approach with this recently posted work: https://www.biorxiv.org/con... in the introduction or discussion. R: Agreed, especially given the similarity of the systems tested. We will discuss this study and how our works relate to it in a future version of this manuscript. References: 1.

Actually, the probes were presented continuously starting 850-450ms prior to saccade onset (assuming ~150ms saccade preparation time) all the way to 500ms after saccade landing (schematic in Fig 1C). During this entire period, Gabor probes were presented every 16ms at one of 13x13 locations spanning the RF and potential remapped locations (Fig 1D). All the analyses in Figs 2 and 3 are shown as a function of probe onset relative to saccade onset. We are certainly aware of your very nice study in eLife. In our study, we wanted to eliminate as much as possible any anticipatory effects by introducing the spatial (one of two spatial locations) and temporal (300-500ms after the acquisition of fixation) uncertainly of the saccade target.

This comment relates to the methodology and my personal experience. Essentially, I have a number of data types (SNP Chip, Exome, Illumina Whole Genome Sequencing, and PacBio HiFi Whole Genome Sequencing for myself).  You can see part of those results if you scroll down to "" Raw Re-Analysis for HLA Typing"" on this page. My HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C (which I believe are the "" class I"" HLA genes) had consistent results that I believe can be reliable. However, at least for myself, I had concerns about the SNP chip imputations for HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 (which I believe are the "" class II"" HLA genes).  The Introduction and Supplemental Tables have HLA-DRB1 results, and that is part of why I wanted to post this comment. If I am correctly understanding that this paper makes noticeable use of SNP chip imputations, then I have the following questions: 1) If I do a quick literature search, I think my own results may be consistent with Pappas et al. 2018 (but perhaps less so with Karnes et al. 2017).  While I had to learn more about HLA/MHC genes, I think it may make sense that it should be easier to make assignments for some genes over others.  Do you agree or disagree with that conclusion? 2) I thought SNP2HLA and HIBAG were relatively common methods for HLA imputations from SNP chip data.  However, is there another method available where I can test generating HLA imputations for my sample and see if they are more consistent with the sequencing results (for the  "" class II"" HLA genes)? If I understand correctly, the GitHub page for this publication describes using SNP2HLA (which I don't think gave reliable imputations for HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 with my SNP chip data, either for 23andMe or Genes for Good).  However, even if that is true, I don't know if the precise settings can have a noticeable effect on the HLA imputation results? Thank you very much!

A next challenge is to use these approaches to predict alternate conformations and the effects of sequence variants on structure. Considering the ubiquity of functionally significant fold-switching and order-disorder transitions, developing the ability to predict these alternate conformations has the potential to inform the discovery of new drug targets. Similarly, the conformational equilibrium of drug receptors relates to their affinities for drugs, highlighting the importance of predicting the relative population of different conformations. Previous research has found that subsampling the input multiple sequence alignments in AF2 and increasing the number of predictions was able to sample alternative structures of the same target protein, even capturing different fold-switching states of known metamorphic proteins. Prior work has also generated conformational ensembles through reducing the max_seq:extra_seq parameter values and used these ensembles as starting points for molecular dynamics simulations to sample more conformations of interest such as cryptic ligand binding pockets. Here, the authors use a similar approach of MSA subsampling to discover alternate conformations and their relative populations of certain proteins purely using the AF2 pipeline without the need for extensive MD simulations. They demonstrate how subsampling MSA by modulating the max_seq:extra_seq parameters can generate ensembles of protein conformations whose relative populations correlate with experimental knowledge. They test AF2’s capacity to predict differences in conformer populations with two example proteins–Abl1 tyrosine kinase core and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF). With Abl1, they found that AF2 can qualitatively predict the effects of mutations on active state populations of kinase cores with up to eighty percent accuracy. They also found that their method predicted most of the activation loop intermediate states in the active-to-inactive transition of the kinase core, performing comparably to predictions obtained from multi-microsecond MD simulations. Despite the paucity of sequence data for GMCSF compared with Abl1, they were able to predict the extent of variation in backbone dynamics among GMCSF variants, which allowed them to conclude that AF’s prediction engine could decode population signals from relatively scarce data. Overall, the results are very interesting and encouraging and the manuscript is well written. We have the following points which we feel, if addressed, could make this manuscript stronger. Major points: 1. The MSA subsampling approach that the authors have adapted in this work has been used by others previously (as cited by the authors themselves), albeit with some modifications. So it is important to see if the existing methodologies, for instance the DBSCAN based clustering and MSA subsampling by Wayment-Steele et al., are able to predict these relative state populations of variants. Also, the optimization of max_seq:extra_seq requires quite a bit of pre-existing experimental information. How is this method to be applied for a relatively new system? The authors could also provide some guidelines on how the max_seq:extra_seq numbers to be sampled are chosen and in general comment about the hyper-parameter space in their approach and how it compares to other schemes/approaches. 2. Apart from the large change in A-loop from active to inactive state in Abl kinase, the other important structure change involves the 𝛼C helix moving out (as shown in Reference 22 cited in the preprint). The authors have not discussed this aspect. The snapshots shown from enhanced MD does not seem to show this change either (upon visual examination of the snapshots shown in the figures). Hence, the biological relevance of the MD simulation becomes questionable. Does the AF2 subsampled ensemble reflect the change in the helix position? 3. The authors haven’t performed statistical analyses on the RMSD comparisons or the CSP comparisons of GMCSF to claim the differences to be significant or not. For example, the authors say their approach has worked “as the range of the distribution of RMSDs of residues 80-90 and 110-125 is significantly larger for most of the mutations tested at both of these sites”. What is this distribution of RMSD compared against? Are these differences statistically significant? 4. Given that GMCSF has very limited sequence data in MSA to start with, does MSA subsampling actually help? The authors could try doing predictions using the traditional AF2 pipeline and compare those distributions against their approach. Minor points: 1. Although the authors are right in looking for only the ground and I2 states in Abl kinase predictions, it will be interesting to explore if there were any predictions that matched the I1 state and if not, to speculate why more extensively 2. The data on some of the max_seq:extra_seq optimizations discussed for Abl kinase is missing. For example, 512:8 or 8:1024 3. There is no citation provided for the single and double mutants whose relative ground state populations were tested for Abl Kinase. 4. The nature of these mutations on Abl Kinase is not discussed. Are some of these mutations pathogenic or drug-resistant? It will be interesting to correlate the nature of mutation with its structural effects.The authors could provide more introduction of how these mutations were identified and add more discussion on trends. 5. What is the rationale behind choosing the PCs mentioned by the authors for Abl kinase enhanced sampling? 6. Why have the authors not shown the RMSD distribution of Distance 2 in Figure 4C? 7. How were the mutations on the histidine triad of GMCSF chosen? Sebollela et al. 2005 ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih..., which is not cited in this paper specifically but cited in one of the papers (Cui et al. 2020 - https://doi.org/10.1021/acs... that this paper cites, substitutes H15 with alanine to demonstrate a decrease in heparin affinity 8. For the GMCSF system, do the authors see a relationship between the plDDT scores and the extent of RMSD? 9. Prior work that uses AF2 to sample conformational ensembles has seen that AF2 is able to predict more diverse conformations when the protein is not part of AF2’s training dataset. Was GMSCF part of the training dataset? If yes, how would the author’s approach vary for a protein that is not part of the training dataset? 10. Some of the figures are not informative/important enough to be main figures. For example, Figure 2 is mainly the AF2 pipeline, Figure 5 is just a pictorial representation of Supplementary Table S1. Also, Figures 6 and 7 could be combined into a single figure. 11. The CSP data for H15N is not shown in Figure 9B whereas its RMSD is shown in Figure 9C 12. The cut-off values used for jackhmmer not mentioned. 13. Residues are being addressed as codons in some places in the text 14.

The initiative to include new species of deer as an experimental model to verify susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 is of remarkable importance. The susceptibility and virological surveillance analyses involving the white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus) have demonstrated the potential spillover of SARS-CoV-2 into wildlife. However, this appears to be just the tip of the iceberg. By adopting new species of deer as a susceptibility model, similar to your approach, we can better predict new scenarios involving SARS-CoV-2. According to your results, it is concerning to learn about the potential susceptibility of mule deer and their ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 with real infection capacity, whereas we observed that elk have lower susceptibility to this virus. In an analysis involving deer ACE2 protein sequences ( https://doi.org/10.1007/s10..., I compared the binding sites that SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter the host cell. The mule deer shares the same binding sites with the WTD, while the elk has a different site, in addition to the evolutionary distance with the deer of the genus Odocoileus. I argued that this variation in an ACE2 binding site could decrease elk susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. It appears that our results corroborate each other. I conclude my comment here by congratulating you on the interesting work and publication by your group.

The algorithm's greedy methodology for finding incongruence in phylogenetic trees under a gamma site heterogeneity model means the algorithm will misclassify punctuated equilibria and variable rates of evolution as recombination events. To illustrate this, the authors need only run this algorithm on mammalian mitochondrial DNA or SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected after 2021. Using their methodology, it wouldn't surprise me if they estimate humans & chimps diverged 100,000 years ago or SARS-CoV-2 arose in late 2020. If you reconstructed a recombinant common ancestor for mammalian mitochondrial DNA that clearly do not recombine, you would greedily construct a common ancestor that appears more like humans than the actual common ancestor by allowing the human genome to define its closest relatives at every small segment of the mitochondrial genome, thereby reducing the genetic distance between humans and its ""RecCA"". Like Pekar et al.'s use of an HIV model of superspreading and unbiased case ascertainment to claim two basal polytomies implies two spillover events, this paper is an unstable stack of methods poorly understood by the authors applied to achieve the desired conclusions, when a modicum of attention to detail can quickly reveal the fatal limitations of their analysis. There are ~1,100 substitutions separating RaTG13 - collected in 2013 - from SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019. SARS-CoV-2 acquired ~25 mutations per year when it was spreading in the far larger global human population and there is little to no evidence that bats suffer chronic infections that would accelerate this rate. Consequently, there are ~44 years of evolution separating SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, slightly fewer for BANAL-52. The authors' complex stack of models, each with clear limitations and biases known to those who make such models, hides this obvious arithmetic fact that contradicts their conclusions.",2023-08-04T16:27:45,,Edward Holmes,10.1101/2023.07.12.548617,The recency and geographical origins of the bat viruses ancestral to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,"Jonathan E.

The authors of the new paper write: ""We define an allelic series as a collection of variants in which increasingly deleterious mutations lead to increasingly large phenotypic effects, and we have developed a gene-based rare-variant association test specifically targeted to identifying genes containing allelic series."" (1) The paper first describing the application of the weighted burden test stated that ""weights were also allocated according to the effect of the variant"" and provided a table documenting how increasingly deleterious mutations were assigned increasingly large weights (2). Since then, the weighted burden test has been used in several published analyses of exome sequence data, including of the same UK Biobank dataset which was used for the COAST analyses (3). It is striking that it is reported in the abstract that ""COAST detects associations, such as that between ANGPTL4 and triglycerides"" while there is no citation to my own paper using the same dataset which explicitly reported that the weighed burden test detected association between ANGPLT4 and hyperlipidaemia, although admittedly this did not reach exome-wide significance (4). Application of the weighted burden test has however yielded other novel gene discoveries which are exome-wide significant (5,6). There is also a published exploration of the performance of different weighting schemes (7). When one method implements an approach that is at least similar to one already published, it is customary to refer to the pre-existing approach and discuss differences. Sometimes a formal comparison of performance may be carried out. Describing the earlier work allows the readership to put the new work in context. However the paper describing COAST fails to cite any of the papers describing or utilising weighted burden analysis. References 1.

There is abundant evidence that each of these languages are based on a variety of natural languages, as attested by the creators of the languages themselves. See e.g. https://www.daytranslations... regarding the creation of Dothraki by David Peterson. Here are some relevant quotes: ""Using words from obscure and exotic languages and the words originally written by Martin, Peterson developed several words and sentences, including attaching prefixes and suffixes to many of the words. He followed how nouns are formed in Swahili and studied the negative forms of verbs in the Estonian language among other languages he used as references, such as Russian, Turkish and Inuktitut. From his initial list of 1,700 words, he was able to expand the Dothraki vocabulary to 10,000."" ""According to Peterson himself, you can see the influences of Arabic and Spanish languages in Dothraki language."" This is true for each of the languages assessed in this paper.

The following is a summary of our conversation with two of the authors of this preprint. The discussion on this preprint by Dr. Daniel Keedy and Virgil Woods revolved around the unexpected changes observed in protein dynamics upon ligand binding, as revealed through Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS). The researchers used this technique to compare two different types of ligands, and their key figure, a rainbow map, illustrates the differences in HDX reaction rates over time. Red residues indicate increased HDX exchange, suggesting higher solvent accessibility and conformational changes, while blue areas represent either distinct conformational changes or the binding interface. The researchers expressed excitement about receiving feedback on how their HDX approach reveals additional information over methods such as crystallography. They also expressed some concern about potential confusion regarding the interpretation of exchange rates and the benefits of HDX over crystallography. They are particularly interested in feedback from scientists who are familiar with analyzing HDX data with alternative software that can incorporate EX1 kinetics. Looking forward, the team plans to collect and analyze more data from HDX and crystallography of small molecule allosteric modulators, focusing on the L-16 site, a less conserved part of the PTP1B structure. In future work, they want to explore other identified binders, but only a few have shown an effect. HDX will be important because they have also struggled to obtain crystal structures and aim to determine where binding is occurring and identify inhibitors. They also plan to study new mutations. This preprint presents a fascinating exploration of protein dynamics upon ligand binding, and the researchers' approach of using HDX-MS offers a unique perspective. The community is encouraged to provide feedback, particularly on the interpretation of HDX data and the potential benefits of this technique over crystallography.",2023-08-01T19:44:42,maddyrostad,Madeleine Rostad,10.1101/2023.07.12.548582,Native dynamics and allosteric responses in PTP1B probed by high-resolution HDX-MS,"Virgil A.

The preclinical data presented doesn't appear to support the clinical study fro the following reasons. Clinically the study is stated as comparing 6 cycles given every 3 weeks of fixed dose of carboplatin versus adaptive therapy arm which is also 6 cycles but where the choice of dose is based on CA-125 dynamics, with N of 40 per arm.  ( Note, as an aside it must be noted that on clinicaltrials.gov there is no mention of how the dose will be adpated based on CA-125 dynamics - there is also no protocol and so no understanding of the size of effect that the study is powered to capture.) Preclinically the authors gave 60mg/kg once every 4 days for 3 doses in the standard of care arm but allowed weekly dosing for up to 20 weeks.  This is not a like for like comparison!  The standard of care arm should have had fxed dose weekly for the 20 weeks. This would have best mimicked the clinical trial they propose as the schedule is fixed only teh dose is changed.  Thus the data does not support the clinical trial being proposed. Furthermore there are other issues with the preclinical study, discussed below. The authors chose to randomise 2 mice to the vehicle and 2 mice to the continuous therapy but 3-5 to the adaptive therapy. (Note, two tumours were grown on each mice.)  This is a really odd design fro a preclinical study, the uncertainty around the size of effect between the arms will be large and add to that the continuous and adaptive doses are not comparable with regards to schedule. Next, it appears the tumour take was not all that successful in general. In Figure 4 B top-panel we see that the tumour were not growing conosistently from one measurement to teh next at tiem of randomisation.  This is evident by looking at the vehicle arm where post randomisation 3 of the mice are not growing at all for a few weeks post time 0 with one never growing at all and simply remaining constant.  Continue down to the middle panel the vehicle looks really odd, we have two tumours out of the 4 not growing properly at all with one spontaneously shrinking after about 4 weeks.  These issues in the vehicle group imply the cell-line chosen has not taken propoerly in the mice.  It suggests little work was done to understand the optimal conditions for the cell-line to grow well on the back of teh mice.

One question I had was whether the CAIS would change much if dataset independent values of Fa (the frequency of amino acid 'a' across the entire dataset of 118 vertebrate genomes in your analysis) were used. For instance, would the resulting CAIS change much if each Fa was set to 0.05? I believe this is the only variable that could make CAIS hard to compare across species in different datasets (e.g., if different Fa values were used when computing CAIS for those species). Also, I was a bit confused at times about whether 'frequency' referred to the counts of instances vs. the proportions of instances. I believe it is the proportion in all cases, but could be good to specify if you are revising another draft prior to publication.

The following is a summary of our conversation with two of the authors of this preprint. The conversation with Dr. Kevin Gardner and Danielle Swingle revolved around their research on the diversity of function and higher-order structure within HWE sensor histidine kinases. The key point of their preprint is the exploration of the variability in this family of histidine kinases, challenging the conventional understanding that they need to be membrane-bound or always exist as dimers. Their research has identified monomers, constitutive dimers, and proteins that fluctuate between these states. Interestingly, they found a light-sensitive histidine kinase that is active in the dark, contrary to expectations of the rest of the family. The figure they are most proud of presents different clusters of homologs of the light-activated monomer that their lab discovered in 2014, clustering into three different families. It also includes two models: one of a monomer sensing kinase and another of a dimer sensing kinase. The authors appreciated the feedback they received on their initial preprint, which was submitted through eLife. The feedback was constructive and inspired them to revise their work post-Covid, resulting in the current Version 2 of the preprint. Potential areas of confusion might arise from their efforts to engineer a monomeric HK based on their discoveries, specifically in distinguishing the different regions between the monomer/dimer swap. They also highlighted the value of preprints in facilitating dialogue about emerging science, offering a balance between the immediacy of social media and the lengthy review process of traditional publishing. Looking forward, they are interested in exploring reverse signaling proteins and their intriguing dynamics and structural components. This research offers a fresh perspective on histidine kinases, challenging conventional understanding and opening up new avenues for exploration.

I believe that this manuscript is largely based on a missunderstanding of the nature of ATAC-seq data. It is important that people processing ATAC-seq data with MACS use single end mode, together with the `--no-model`, `--extsize` and `--shift` options. In correct usage of tools can easily lead to sub-optimal results. The MACS tool was original built to analyse ChIP-seq data when most sequencing data was single-ended, and the use of it in the default single-end mode when the data is pair-ended, can indeed lead to results that could be better if the full data set was considered. In ChIP-seq DNA is fragmented, and then fragments that are bound by a protein factor are isolated by immunoprecipitation. The protein factor could be bound at any place in the recovered fragment, but we only sequence the ends. Because fragmentation positions are random, we can look at the genome positions that are covered by the most fragments, and identify them as the most likely binding positions for the protein factor of interest. Because a protein factor could be bound anywhere in a fragement, it is imporant to know the extent of the fragment. In the days of single-end sequencing, this could only be achieved by guess work, and clever statistics. An average fragment size would be estimated from the data, and single end reads extended to cover this. But this was always only a guess. With pair-ended data this guess work is unneccessary, as we know where the ends are. So if you have paired-end ChIP-seq data, and use single end mode in MACS2, you are a) discarding half the data, and b) making a guess at fragment length when you don't need to guess. However, ny guess is that in practice the differences are fairly minor. However, this manuscript is based not on ChIP-seq data, but on ATAC-seq data and ATAC-seq data is fundementally different in nature.  In ATAC-seq we use a transposase to create DNA fragments by ""transposing"" a sequencing adaptor into the genome. Since the transposase can only attack nucleosome free DNA, we can use the locations of transposition to identify regions of open chromatin. Whereas in ChIP-seq we are trying to identify a single location, which, for a single-fragment, could be anywhere in that fragment, in ATAC-seq we know exactly where the location of interest is for any fragment. Actaully there are two locations of interest, and they are located exactly at either end of the fragment. The area inbetween these two ends is of no interest. In ATAC-seq, rather than read pairs being connected to come up with a candidate region for protein binding (as in ChIP-seq), they are two seperate, independent, and unconnected samples from all open-chromatin locations in the genome, and should be treated thus. Consider the following situation with two nucleosome free regions and some ATAC reads (* marks closed chormatin, - open) |>>> |>>> |>>> |>>>         <<<| *********|---------|*********|---------|********* Using MACS in paired end mode would lead to the following depth profile: ############## ################## ####################### ########################### *********|---------|*********|---------|********* That is, the two nucleosome free regions are merged into a single extended peak. However, if we use the standard ATAC-seq approach of treating each read as independent (either map both ends as single ended, or map paired-end and then alter flags to mark all reads as read1), shift the read 3' by X bases and then extend the read by 2X bases to get this: |>>>>>|                  | |>>>>>|                  | |>>>>>|         | |>>>>>|         | *********|---------|*********|---------|********* And then with MACS2 in `--no-model` mode, you would get this depth profile: ## #                ###### ###########           ######## ###############       ############ *********|---------|*********|---------|********* That is there are two peaks, that more or less match the two open chromatin regions.",2023-07-21T14:08:39,ian_sudbery,Ian Sudbery,10.1101/496521,Improved peak-calling with MACS2,John M.

Such a diversity, and putative inheritance from the father with dementia at the age of 83, suggests that additional factors may be required to result in AD, at least before the age of 70-75, knowing that LOAD is very common. This variant may not be sufficient, to my opinion, to cause AD, although it seems to be a strong determinant. I also found interesting to see that we also have the same variant as in this work, in one of our (unpublished) patients (R953C). It is a sporadic case with an age at onset of 56 years, APOE genotype 3-4, unaffected parents at 80, large family, no other case except a paternal grandmother with an age at onset of 80. Unless there is a de novo mutation, which we could not check yet, it is not consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. I hope we can see if one of the parents is a carrier or not, as this will help us better understand the penetrance of the variant. This paper adds another variant to the increasing list of variants with a maturation defect. We previously reported 15 variants with a similar effect in a previous paper (Rovelet-Lecrux et al., Acta Neuropathologica Communications 2021) after expression of 70 missense variants in HEK cells. We selected 3 variants with such an effect and 2 without, to further evaluate them in IPSCs after Crispr/cas9 introduction, and found that all three selected missense variants showed a maturation defect, including one with a milder effect. The 2 variants with the strongest maturation defect showed significantly increased secreted Abeta levels, clearly linking these variants to AD pathophysiology. It is however not clear why, in the current paper, the authors mention our own by paper with the following sentence: ""Furthermore, a larger screen of 70 SORL1 coding variants suggested that impaired maturation may be general for dysfunctional proteins although no correlation to AD was established."" We only studied SORL1 and we showed a direct link with AD for these specific variants, with the above-mentioned mechanism. We only discussed the fact that this way, for a missense variant, to result in a loss of function of its encoded protein, has been described in other diseases, but in our work we only studed SORL1, there must be a misunderstanding on this point.",2023-07-21T13:53:27,gael_nicolas,Gaël Nicolas,10.1101/2023.07.01.547348,A familial missense variant in the AD gene SORL1 impairs its maturation and endosomal sorting,"Elnaz Fazeli, Daniel D.

The following is a summary of our conversation with one of the authors of this preprint. Dr. Lauren Porter's discussion focused on her research on the evolutionary selection of proteins that can assume different folds, particularly in response to stimuli. The key point of the preprint is the prediction of sequence features for fold-switching proteins, which undergo relatively dramatic secondary and tertiary structure changes. They specifically study homologs that switch from an alpha-helical to a beta-sheet state, a significant change. Their research suggests that fold-switching is not random but is evolutionarily selected, a finding that challenges current understanding in the field. Dr. Porter’s favorite figure connects different sequence alignments with the helical and beta sheet structures, identifying positions in the alignment that make unique contacts to the beta sheet fold and the alpha sheet fold. Dr. Porter is particularly interested in feedback on their argument that evolution selects for these proteins and makes them different. She acknowledged that some of the figures might be hard to interpret for different communities (e.g. evolutionary biologists might find some protein structure aspects confusing and some of the evolutionary insights to be obvious, whereas structural biologists might be surprised by some of the evolutionary biology). Looking forward, they plan to use these results to build on existing methodology to reliably predict two folds from one sequence. They hope to achieve this within the next year. Dr. Porter also shared her thoughts on the preprinting system, discussing the complications around reviewing preprints and benchmarking against methods that have not yet been peer-reviewed. She also expressed how having more accountability in terms of commenting and making changes to preprints could elevate the scientific discourse.

The key point of the preprint is the identification of how a key regulatory molecule (a GAP protein) regulates an important membrane trafficking co-complex. They knew these two elements interacted, but pinpointing where the interaction was happening among the seven subunits was challenging.

She also found preprints to be beneficial for grant applications. Most of the feedback they received came from peer review, and the preprint story differs from the final published version as they took out a crystal structure and turned it into its own paper during the review process.

The following is a summary of our conversation with one of the authors of this preprint. Dr. Alex Guseman's discussion centered on his research on inhibiting SARS-CoV2 viral entry by targeting spike glycans. The key point of the preprint is the interaction of lectins with spike proteins, which facilitates viral entry. The research uses dynamic light scattering to demonstrate that treatment with lectins rapidly aggregates spike proteins. The team used fluorescence binding assays to fit an isotherm to a 1:1 ratio, although the exact stoichiometry remains unknown. The figure they consider most important proposes that multivalent interactions are essential and that these interactions depend on glycans. Interestingly, they found that other Covid variants are also inhibited. Potential areas of confusion might arise from understanding the concept of multivalent interaction and the importance of stoichiometry in the interaction of spikes with the BOA lectin. The team emphasized that these interactions are not within spike proteins, but rather between BOA and multiple other spikes. The team is seeking feedback on additional experiments for future studies that could further explore their model. While animal models of infection may be the ultimate test, this is beyond the scope of this study for both effort and cost. The authors are looking for community feedback on how future  biophysical experiments can probe the nature of the multivalent interactions. Since the preprint was posted, some other lectins have been tested and shown to have an inhibitory effect. The team believes it might be valuable to look at other interactions in the future. They also want to explore more about the monovalent version that is not interacting in the same way. Dr. Guseman's experience with preprint feedback has been positive.

But I didn't see this comment on your Table 1. By the way, where can I find your simulated data? I  am  developing a tool for PAS identification and quantification. I am wondering if I can use your simulated data.

The sentence, ""They then randomly select that many sequences, with replacement from each sample"", should have ""without"" rather than ""with"". Thus the sentence would read ""They then randomly select that many sequences, without replacement from each sample"". This correction will be included in the next version of the preprint",2023-07-19T12:56:20,pschloss,Pat Schloss,10.1101/2023.06.23.546313,Rarefaction is currently the best approach to control for uneven sequencing effort in amplicon sequence analyses,Patrick D.
