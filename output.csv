https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.09.523344v1#comment-6181055197,biorxivstage,0,"Thanks for posing this interesting question. We manipulated chromosome 1q in four different cell lines - A2780, AGS, A2058, and MCF10A. In A2780 and MCF10A, TP53 is wild-type and the cells have a functional p53 pathway. In AGS and A2058, p53 is either mutated or non-functional. (I know that AGS is reported to have wild-type TP53, but we pulsed these cells with a DNA damaging-drug and they didn't up-regulate p53 targets, so either this cell line has acquired a mutation in TP53 or there's some other alteration in the pathway). There's clearly a strong interaction between 1q copy number and TP53 mutation status, as 1q gains are much more common in TP53-wildtype tumors compared to TP53-mutant tumors. However, there is still a significant fraction of TP53-mutant tumors with 1q gains, so there's probably some benefit for this aneuploidy that's p53-independent. We don't yet know what it is. Regarding the role of p53 in the 1q-regain events that we observed, it's an interesting question and we haven't done the experiment. p53-mutant cells have a weaker G2 checkpoint, so they might enter mitosis with unrepaired DNA damage or replication fork problems that promote chromosome missegregation. But that's just a hypothesis, it would be interesting to test!",2023-05-09T19:25:42,jasonsheltzer,Jason Sheltzer,10.1101/2023.01.09.523344,Oncogene-like addiction to aneuploidy in human cancers,"Vishruth Girish, Asad A.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.25.538336v2#comment-6179658927,biorxivstage,1,"There is a negative correlation between the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondrial material from raccoon dogs and hoary bamboo rats. This sentence was recently cited in an article in the NY Times with an unfortunate and wrong headline (""Why Does Bad Science on Covid’s Origin Get Hyped?"" David Wallace-Wells, 3/May/2023): Overall, across the full database of genetic material found in the market, the presence of raccoon-dog DNA was negatively correlated with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 material: When samples had more raccoon-dog genetic material, there was actually less SARS-CoV-2 than was found in other samples. An article in Nature (Dyani Lewis 04/May/2023) reports that ""there was no such association that made sense"" and ""In fact, the strongest associations were with species, such as fish, cows and goats."" I argue that most positive and negative correlations reported in this manuscript and in the Liu et al preprint (2022) do, in fact, make sense. Liu et al reported sampling rationale (Nature 2023. Extended data tables 2 and 3). Sampling on 1/Jan was largely premised on proximity to human COVID-19 cases with disease onset in mid-to-late December 2019. Sampling on 12/Jan was for ""environmental samples from stalls that sold livestock, poultry, farmed wildlife"" an examination of maps sampled stalls shows that sampling had little relation to reported COVID-19 cases. I reproduced the visualizations in Fig 5 and colored spots based on species category in the market context (e.g. human, meat, fish, wildlife). I additionally examined correlations for data from 1/Jan only. Examining 1/Jan and 12/Jan separately shows little correlation. What is left for 1/Jan is largely expected positive correlation from correlated error on 1/Jan for species with the high abundance on a day when there are no samples negative for viral RNA. It is only when combining 1/Jan and 12/Jan data, or when combining all sampling dates, that the reported correlations are observed with all parameter combinations: positive correlations for meat and fish, and negative correlation for some wildlife species. This is an artifact of combining sampling focused on COVID-19 cases on one day, with sampling focused to a large extent on wildlife sales on subsequent days. The expectation is that later samples will be lower in viral RNA because of lack of proximity to a COVID-19 case and also sample degradation. Lastly, for 12/Jan there is correlation for species disproportionately found in stall 6-29/31/33, with no known link to a human COVID-19 case, and later sampling shows that this was a reason for concern in February/March 2020. This is the stall with samples analyzed by Crits-Cristoph et al (2023). The 182 animal samples reported linked to this stall include rabbit (85), hedgehog (65), snake (24), bamboo rat (5), other (3). Unfortunately, there are no reported samples of animals linked to this stall from other species: raccoon dog, malayan porcupine, palm civet, and human.",2023-05-07T23:36:25,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,10.1101/2023.04.25.538336,Association between SARS-CoV-2 and metagenomic content of samples from the Huanan Seafood Market,Jesse D.

The authors clearly demonstrate that increased mitochondrial ceramide causes CoQ depletion and leads to insulin resistance. However, I believe some claims in the paper are somewhat over-interpreted, e.g. 'One possibility is that palmitate induces insulin resistance in L6 myotubes via a ceramide-independent pathway. However, this is unlikely as palmitate-induced insulin resistance was prevented by the ceramide biosynthesis inhibitor myriocin (Fig. 1A) and we observed a specific increase in C16-ceramide levels in L6 cells following incubation with palmitate, which was also prevented by myriocin'. Ceramide potently reduces membrane fluidity, so it could be that the pharmacological and genetic manipulations done in the manuscript results in altered mitochondrial membrane fluidity. As such, it is not a result of increased ceramide per se, but overall alterations of mitochondrial membrane properties. If I was a reviewer, I would suggest the authors to perform additional rescue experiments, particularly using membrane - fluidising fatty acids, such as oleate, EPA or DHA. I suspect that they might equally rescue palmitate-induced CoQ depletion and insulin resistance. Other than that, it is amazing work providing great insight into the core biological mechanisms driving insulin resistance.",2023-05-05T08:06:00,kasparaspetkevicius,Kasparas Petkevicius,10.1101/2023.03.10.532020,"Mitochondrial electron transport chain, ceramide and Coenzyme Q are linked in a pathway that drives insulin resistance in skeletal muscle","Alexis Diaz-Vegas, Soren Madsen, Kristen C.

Regarding snakehead fish, I also noticed this and looked closer. Reads are very rarely mapped for that species, confidence intervals are much wider for correlation, and it's negatively correlated with PCR. This is driven by a single sample (Q37) that is from the inside of a freezer in stall 8-25. I think this is the only sample with SC2-mapped reads not from stall 6-29/31/33 on 12/Jan. Similar story for another species identified in the same sample. Amur hedgehog, European hedgehog (unsure if this is a species expected to be found here), and Malayan porcupine have the highest correlation Spearman correlation for 12/Jan with what seems like sensible parameter choices. All also rank highly for correlation with PCR, as do goat and dog. Of course I agree that the data don't point to any one species and human reads being rare in one sample does not rule us out, either. However, I don't think that this is inconsistent with either of the news articles cited in the manuscript, with both articles including a variety of opinions on the strength of this evidence. Both articles correctly report that the data points to one stall that wasn't sampled based on a reported human COVID-19 case, that stall happened to have quite a few raccoon dog reads, and investigators in early 2020 clearly noticed this as well and collected 205 additional samples focus on this stall... unfortunately waiting quite a while to start.",2023-05-03T19:45:24,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,10.1101/2023.04.25.538336,Association between SARS-CoV-2 and metagenomic content of samples from the Huanan Seafood Market,Jesse D.

Below is a review compiled by the MICR603 ""Journal club in immunology"" at the University of Tennessee Knoxville: UTK MICR603 “Journal club in immunology” review of the paper by Gül et al. “Intraluminal neutrophils limit epithelium damage by reducing pathogen assault on intestinal epithelial cells during Slamonella gut infection” Summary: The work of Gül et al. investigates the role of neutrophil recruitment and activity on epithelial cell damage during Salmonella infection. They investigate this using several techniques including several in vivo models and microscopy. The authors investigate this from different angles by utilizing germ free mice that lack a resident gut microbiota and by investigating epithelial integrity and shedding during normal and neutrophil-depleted infections. Positive feedback: The authors provide an in detail review of what is understood during Salmonella infection and what is not during the different stages of infection in several different models. This provides solid reasoning for their use of several different model systems in this paper. Additionally, they are commended for their use of not only different Salmonella strains (wild-type vs mutants) but their use of different host models and antibiotic treatments to strengthen their claims and understanding of Salmonella infection and the role of neutrophils during infection. The authors use several different controls/treatments/previous studies to further back up their results and claims seen in this paper. For example, they further confirm their neutrophil depletion results by comparing against their controls as well as previous study results with neutrophil and monocyte depletions which takes away uncertainties that their results could be due to monocyte presence in the neutrophil depleted mice. Additionally, the use of experimental diagrams/design in figures is very useful when referencing other data in the figure. The authors are also commended on their use of microscopy to back up their data quantification and their flow and organization of figure panels. Major Concerns: •	4a- Antibiotic pre-treatment can greatly influence Salmonella invasion… every other figure/model uses streptomycin model and this one is using ampicillin (inconsistency with pre-treatment). Could you compare streptomycin and ampicillin results? Can they comment on what happens with ampicillin+WT treated mice? •	Were mice being placed in clean cages after gentamicin treatment? •	Gentamicin treatment: clarify if it was just in drinking water or during cecal tissue plating. A few sentences clarifying this is needed. •	Germ free mice: they interpret these as no bacteria in the gut, but they also have weird immune systems because of this. Would it be better to pretreat WT mice with antibiotic cocktail to deplete the residential microbiota without perturbing the immune system? •	How do you know the pad4 drug is working? Some confirmation here is needed. Minor concerns: •	The authors use the abbreviation “mLN” in multiple figures and their writing without defining what this is. It may not be clear to some readers what this is referring to. •	When referencing P values in the figure captions, it would be beneficial to state the actual P value and not just >/< in order to add more impact to the statistics.  •	5e- different microscopy planes : control is a cross section and neutrophil depletion is from a top plane of view •	5d - levels spelled incorrectly •	Why use pad4 inhibitor instead of pad4 deficient mice •	Pad4 inhibitor IP injection vs oral administration – reasoning for the use of one over the other could be better described. •	Controls in Fig1 are incomplete - no uninfected group and no isotype control group •	What is the dashed line in 1B? – Some further clarification is needed •	Conclusion: limitations of study needed •	1e: instead of quantifying with a 63X field of view they could use area metrics instead (more quantifiable) •	4 - B&C y axis - connect these units to whole organ so you can compare the bacterial load in lumen vs epithelial tissue •	Mention division time of salmonella in vivo / in vitro •	Speculate mechanism of expulsion? •	Do we know that these are intact cells in imaging",2023-05-03T13:45:00,,UTK Micr603,10.1101/2023.02.23.529832,Intraluminal neutrophils limit epithelium damage by reducing pathogen assault on intestinal epithelial cells during Salmonella gut infection,"Ersin Gül, Stefan A.

Pterin pigments create the color variation observed across butterflies as well as other species. However, there has been limited study of pterin and genetic variation in wild butterfly populations. Male C. philodice butterflies are observed to have yellow pterin expression while C. eurytheme displays orange pterin expression. Males are also known to have variation in UV-iridescence in both species. Both female C. philodice and C. eurytheme express a white phenotype since their pterin expression is reduced. QTL mapping across F2 hybrid males revealed a candidate gene red on chromosome 18 for pterin pigmentation variation. Mosaic knockout experiments on this gene revealed a decrease in pterin content, causing males to look more similar to the female phenotype, and significant disorganization of pterin granule structures. QTL mapping also revealed a second gene interacting with red, the transcription factor bab on chromosome Z, which had been previously documented to cause an increase in UV-iridescence, especially in females. Knockout experiments for bab in females showed a visible increase in UV-iridescence when viewed from a 30-degree angle, and increased orange pigmentation on the dorsal region and a variety of effects on other areas of the wings. The interaction between these loci controls an estimated 70% of pigmentation variation. Wing size is another trait that the authors hypothesized could be controlled by the sex chromosome. PCA analysis of male butterfly wing size distinguished between the UV-iridescent males and non-UV-iridescent males. When a QTL analysis was performed, the authors found significant markers at chromosomes Z and 2. Through two-QTL analyses, they found that 18% of size variation across males could be explained by an interaction between these loci. The combined data suggest that the Z chromosome plays a key role in intraspecific variation and distinguishing traits between C. philodice and C. eurytheme. The authors did an exceptional job of connecting pertinent and creative analyses to the conclusions drawn toward the end of each subsection, as well as the overall logical flow and organization of the manuscript. In particular, their usage of QTL analyses all supported the conclusions drawn with regard to the sex-linked component of the color trait. This was significant because it set up additional experiments on this Z-chromosome, such as the male UV iridescence experiments studying the bab transcription factor. This made for a much easier read and allowed the paper to build on itself through each of its analyses. Additionally, the presentation of the automated phenotyping experiments before any other data created a much needed visual background for the subsequent molecular analyses. Understanding the phenotypic variation under scrutiny was valuable for the comprehension of what followed, so this was certainly a major strength and a clever way to present information. The described logical flow is also rooted in the paragraph structure throughout the manuscript which made the paper much more accessible to non-expert audiences. For example, most paragraphs began with a broad introductory sentence describing a rundown of what was done in the section, followed by a more in-depth description of the experimentation and interpretation of their results. It is also worth noting that many of the experiments were very creative and yielded visually appealing analyses and highly convincing results. For example, the SEM analyses conducted on the red crispant scales added a fascinating visual component of microscopic phenotypic differences that correlate on a larger scale to observed variation in scale pigmentation. Having multiple levels of visual data lends well to the conclusion that the intactness of the red gene is necessary for most (not all, however, as in Alba individuals) wild-type pigmentation in C. eurytheme and C. philodice. Overall, the combination of experimental creativity, thorough organization, and logical flow all contribute to an interesting and well-executed manuscript. Major Point: As a broad note, one of the aims could have been tied together with the others more comprehensively. Specifically, we suggest that a more thorough justification of the wing size analysis is provided. While it was included in the introduction, it jumps out in the sense that it is only marginally related to the main focus of continuous color variation. Deepening the connection would serve as a much needed transition because, in the current draft, the wing size data appear to be added onto the end rather than an integral and interconnected part of the study. Part of the reason for this is that the other aims flow so well and appear in a logical order, while this experiment is almost ancillary. The experiment and accompanying analysis are still valuable and absolutely warranted in the paper, but strengthening the justification for their inclusion would go a long way in making the transition more seamless. Minor Points: Figure 1, legend, section H-I: “Agricultural site”, we suggest that these sites are specified. Figure 1J, legend: we suggest the inclusion of a p-value on the graph or in the legend. Page 6, paragraph 3: A period is missing at the end of the last sentence. Page 8, paragraph 5: “Marginally significant interaction”, we suggest a p-value be specified. Figure 3B: We suggest a p-value be included on the graph or in the legend. Page 10, paragraph 1: “...fused with other chitinous elements”, we suggested that the fusion be expanded on, as it is unclear without background insect knowledge. Page 12, paragraph 2: “Of note”, we recommend this be deleted or the wording changed. Page 12, paragraph 3: “...pterin pigmentation in females in a complex fashion…” we suggest the deletion of “in a complex fashion.” Figure 6, A-K: We recommend the use of the alternative transformed data from the supplement (using the purple, blue and pink color scale) or the inclusion of specific color swatches sampled from the images to to highlight the extent of the color differences that are not as visible to the untrained eye. In general, the alternative transformed data was more visually striking and helped us observe the differences more readily, so perhaps these can be incorporated throughout the paper while the raw images are placed in the supplement. Figure 6D: We recommend that the wild-type and knock-out regions are better highlighted by using a thicker black line to highlight the boundaries between the two. Finding ways to increase the amount of contrast in all of the figures containing wing images would be helpful, as there are a lot of the same colors next to each other. Figure 7A: We suggest a P-value be included either on the graph or in the legend. Page 16, paragraph 1: We suggest considering a rewrite of the first three sentences in the discussion section. There are a few run-on sentences that have too much additional punctuation, making it a little difficult to connect the sentences together without having to reread. Shortening the sentences would also make them a bit punchier which is more advisable for driving home a point. Page 22, methods on butterfly mapping broods: We suggest including the reason for selection of summer conditions, as well as perhaps the inclusion of how the winter conditions may affect the observed results. Seasonal variation is mentioned several times during the manuscript as being an observable and testable phenotypically plastic trait, so this justification would be consistent with the claims that have been made in the text",2023-05-02T18:08:52,,Priscilla,10.1101/2023.02.03.526907,Genetics of continuous colour variation in a pair of sympatric sulphur butterflies,"Joseph J.

I am curious what parameter combinations were attempted and how reasonable it is to call them ""cherry picking."" Sampling on 1/Jan was biased to locations known to be linked to humans recently infected with SARS-CoV-2 and is expected to show correlation between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and nucleic acids from both humans and species sold at these locations. Sampling on 12/Jan was biased towards locations known to be linked to wildlife sales without, as far as I know, reason to expect a positive SARS-CoV-2 result by PCR or sequencing. In my hands, the only ""cherry picking"" that is required is including samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 and not including sampling from 1/Jan when it was focused on locations of human COVID-19 cases. The result is that samples with reads for ""Amur hedgehog"" and ""Malayan porcupine"" consistently rank highly with any choice of parameters otherwise. This is also true if examining correlation between species reads and positivity by PCR. It is difficult to say it's ""cherry picking"" to focus on the one day with sampling not biased to locations expected to have reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2. However, I agree with comments by Débarre and Crits-Cristoph that this type of correlation analysis is problematic. In the end, in pointing to multiple species it points to one location. That location and locations and animal carcasses linked to it were subsequently sampled hundreds of times, so clearly investigators saw correlation in this data and acted on it.",2023-05-02T16:06:52,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,10.1101/2023.04.25.538336,Association between SARS-CoV-2 and metagenomic content of samples from the Huanan Seafood Market,Jesse D.

I have a couple points: 1) It would be nice to know the expression level of the different FPs. 2) I think the best photobleaching comparison would be to set the illumination power differently for each FP to have each sample start at the same brightness, then rank the brightnesses after 30 s. That eliminates the confounding variable that some FPs absorb photons at a higher rate (and thus might bleach sooner) at a particular wavelength.

The second figure is definitely much more informative than the first, and I agree with the general sentiment that categorical thinking is misleading when dealing with variables that are continuous in reality. That being said, the discourse on rates of sexual dimorphism in the literature is largely based on dichotomies/trichotomies, and we set out to test the commonly touted narrative of larger males being the norm in mammals (i.e., in this flawed discourse framed in terms of categories, does that narrative hold even on their own terms?). Our study is therefore seeking to estimate the rates of dimorphism in mammals, not looking for an effect of some variable on the degree of dimorphism, so effect sizes are not too relevant to our question. You are correct that the monomorphic category would include species with low dimorphism as well as high uncertainty in dimorphism. We mitigated for the effect of sample size on uncertainty by running an analysis on the relationship between sample size and confidence interval and cutting out all data with sample sizes lower than where the ‘elbow’ of the curve marked a transition from a rapid decline in confidence intervals with increasing sample size to a drastically diminished return in tighter confidence intervals with increasing sample size (see supplementary figure Fig. S1). That leaves a low degree of dimorphism and high variance in body size (in males, females, or both) as the major contributors to the monomorphic category, and we don’t see that as a problem. In our view, having high variance in body size should count towards an increased probability of being considered monomorphic, as it shifts the body size distributions of each sex into greater overlap. Breaking up that monomorphic group into those that fall just above or below zero difference in body size doesn’t make too much sense to me. As you say yourself, there is no expectation of a difference of exactly zero and that would not be a reasonable standard. One would expect for many mammals to be essentially monomorphic in body size (why wouldn’t there be monomorphic mammals?). I hear you on the significance testing and agree that it is usually an insufficient approach to draw inference from data. However, it happens to be amenable to the simple question we are asking in this paper since we are just interested in rates. Ideally, we would have raw data for each species that would allow for more nuanced analyses of the shapes of body size frequency distributions in males and females, but it was hard enough even just to obtain body mass means AND measures of variance for each sex for a large number of species. Further analyses of the data to explore degrees of dimorphism to answer other questions should definitely use more nuanced approaches. Thanks again for putting so much thought and effort into providing feedback on the paper! I will likely be in Princeton for reunions and would love to discuss further!

Below, I attach my responses to each point with reproduction of the comment. Since these commentary is not capable of pasting modified visuals, added/modified visuals can be seen in the published version of the manuscript (doi: 10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01273) Comment: The manuscript by Zerze reports on molecular dynamics simulations of the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of FUS using a beta version of the coarse-grained force field Martini 3. The author performed simulations to study the formation of FUS LCD condensates under varying protein-water interaction strengths (in the Martini force field) and at different NaCl concentrations, and concludes that strengthening protein-water interactions by a factor of 1.03 improves the agreement with experimental transfer free energies between the dilute and dense phases. Additionally, the author concludes that the NaCl concentration affects condensate morphology and protein-protein interactions in the condensate, and that the effect of NaCl concentration on protein-protein interactions in the condensate is sensitive to rescaling of the protein-water interactions. The manuscript provides an interesting and novel benchmark of the (beta) Martini 3 model in predicting phase separation of IDPs, and reveals potential short-comings of the model in predicting protein concentrations in (or volumes of) the condensed and dilute phases. This benchmark will be useful for readers who wish to simulate liquid-liquid phase separation of IDPs with Martini 3, and the work will be interesting to a wider audience interested in the biophysics of IDPs and their condensates. Below we outline some questions and comments that the author might take into account when revising the manuscript. Our main comment regards a clearer assessment of the convergence of the simulations and correspondingly the lack of error estimates for observables calculated from the simulations. We also suggest a clearer presentation of the experimental data used to validate the simulations. While some of these changes are mostly textual, in other cases we suggest additional simulations. We realize that some of these simulations require substantial resources; if these are beyond what is available, we suggest at least to clarify caveats as per the points below. The author’s response: I thank the reviewer for their scrutiny and thoughtful comments that greatly helped substantiating the optimization analysis in the revised version of the manuscript. Comment: We have the following suggestions for revisions to the manuscript: 1) Fig. 1 and 2: The finding of non-spherical droplets is interesting and intriguing. To examine whether the formation of these shapes in the simulations with higher salt and λ-values represent stable states or perhaps trapped metastable states of the system, we suggest that: 1a) The author runs simulations with the parameters that give rise to non-spherical morphologies (e.g. λ=1.025 and 50 mM NaCl) starting from the structure of the spherical droplet (for example formed with λ=1.0 and no salt) and observe whether the non-spherical morphology is recovered or the droplet remains stable. If the droplet remains stable, then the effect of salt concentration on the inter-chain contacts (Fig. 6) could be assessed without potentially confounding factors from different dense phase morphologies. The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, I have performed an additional set of simulations for all λ values (1, 1.01, 1.02, 1.025, 1.03) at 50 mM salt concentration starting from a preformed spherical droplet. The initial condition with the preformed droplet is obtained from the last saved frame of the λ=1 simulation for 0 mM salt. We ran the simulations for 10 microseconds each. Within the given time frame the droplet remained stable for λ values 1, 1.01, 1.02, and 1.025 without a dilute phase concentration. I now added these findings into the supporting information (Figure S5). I also modified the main text (Page 9 last paragraph and Page 10 first paragraph) as follows: “Recent studies from independent groups show that the nonspherical droplet formation might be a kinetic arrest, playing an important role in droplet maturation and aging [51–53]. To test whether the nonspherical morphologies we observed are impacted by the initial conditions, we rerun 50 mM at all λ values starting from a preformed droplet (last saved configuration of 0 mM salt, λ = 1 condition). We simulated each λ for 10 μs and presented the analysis in Figure S5. Within the given simulation time, the initially spherical droplets stayed intact and spherical, except for λ=1.03, which had one copy of the FUS LC protein exchange back and forth between the dense and dilute phases). The enlarged droplet in the case of λ=1.03 also deviated from its initially spherical shape. These findings show that the nonspherical morphology was not reproducible for λ values less than 1.03 when starting from a preformed spherical droplet. We argue that the strength of effective protein-protein interactions at low λ are largely responsible from the initial spherical droplet staying intact.” Since the droplets stayed nearly spherical, I also analyzed the contact formation in these simulations (50 mM added salt, initially starting from a spherical preformed droplet) and presented the findings in Figure S7. I also discussed these findings in the main text as follows (Page 19, 20, the last paragraph before Conclusions): “Finally, we also examined the contact formation for the case of 50 mM added salt that starts from a preformed droplet (see Identification of condensate formation subsection for the description). As presented in Figure S5, we found that the initially spherical droplet remains largely spherical within the simulation time (never forms rod-like percolated structures) for this case. Therefore, this case helps us assess the effect of salt concentration on the inter-chain contacts without potentially confounding factors from different dense phase morphologies. Figure S7 shows both the contact propensity (A.) and the effect of salt concentration (B.) on the contact propensity. Figure S7A shows that the contact propensity decreases as the λ parameter increases, similar to the findings in Figure 5. Figure S7B shows, however, that the change in contact fraction with respect to 0 mM salt at λ = 1 is weaker (resembling λ = 1.02 at 50 mM salt in Figure 6A) although the salting out effect at high λ (λ = 1.025 and 1.03) are more prominent and stronger compared to those in Figure 6A.” Comment: 1b) The author shows time-series or distributions of an observable that reports on the dynamics of the proteins in the non-spherical droplet (e.g. Rg, mean square displacement, residue-residue contacts) and/or of an observable that reports on the dynamics of the droplet shape (e.g. the x-, y-, and z-components of the gyration tensor). The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we added the analysis of observables that reports on dynamics of shape fluctuations and size and presented them in Figure S4. We also modified the main text (Page 9, second half of the second paragraph) to discuss these findings: “We also investigated the time dependence of the size and shape of these morphologies by quantifying the radius of gyration (Rg) and the ratio of the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the gyration tensor (Figure S4). The latter offers a measure of sphericity of droplets. We found that low λ cases (λ = 1, 1.01, 1.02) at 0 mM salt have the most spherical morphologies. Beyond λ = 1.025 at no salt, the cluster formation is not tight (as evident from the Rg) so it also loses its sphericity. The condition that shows percolation (λ = 1 at 50 mM salt) has the largest deviation from the sphericity (it is rod-like instead) combined with a large Rg.” Comment: 1c) Additionally, independent replicas of droplet formation for each condition and parameter set would be ideal, but we realize that this would be expensive in computational resources and may be infeasible. The author’s response: We agree with the reviewer that the molecular simulations presented in this work are highly computationally demanding (e.g., a 10-microsecond simulation of one of these simulations at given salt and given λ takes about 25 days in terms of walk-clock time, occupying 28 CPUs and 4 GPUs) While it certainly is computationally demanding to replicate all λ parameters at all salt concentrations, we now rerun 50 mM salt concentration at all λ parameters where we start from a completely different initial condition (preformed droplet) for each. And we found that the morphology was not reproducible within the given simulation time at low λ, highlighting the initial condition dependence at low λ conditions. We now discussed this in the main text (Page 21, Conclusions). “We also note that we observed an initial condition dependence of the morphology at low λ conditions at 50 mM salt. This finding emphasizes the necessity of future work for exploring condensate morphology with proper advanced sampling techniques.” Comment: 2) “As λ increases, the volume of the dense phase increases (and condensed phase concentration decreases accordingly) until the system is not capable of forming a dense phase (λ >1.03)”: From Fig. 1 it seems that the rate of cluster formation decreases as λ increases. Is it not then possible that droplet formation at λ>1.03 is stable at equilibrium, but occurs on time-scales greater than those tested in the simulations? To support the statement that no droplets are stable at λ>1.03, we suggest that the author runs simulations with a higher value of λ starting from the structure of the spherical droplet (formed with λ=1.0 and no salt) to observe whether the droplet is dissolved or remains stable. The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have performed a simulation for λ=1.04 at no salt condition starting from the preformed spherical droplet (last saved configuration of λ=1.0 at 0mM salt) and we found that the droplet quickly dissolves for λ=1.04. This finding is now presented in Figure S3. The main text is also modified as follows (Page 9, end of the first paragraph): “To further verify that no droplets are stable beyond λ = 1.03, we also ran λ = 1.04 simulations at no salt conditions starting from a preformed spherical droplet (last saved configuration of λ = 1 at 0 mM salt). We then analyzed the cluster formation as a function of time (Figure S3) and found that the initial droplet dissolves quickly (at a timescale shorter than that of the formation of the droplets).” Comment: 3) Figure 3: The use of the radial distribution does not seem ideal for the droplets that have a non-spherical morphology, as certain distances will report on an average over the dense and dilute phases. This should at a minimum be discussed. The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added further discussion related radial density distribution to the main text (Page 12, first paragraph): “This approach works reasonably well for droplets that have spherical/ellipsoidal shapes. However, since the condensates for the conditions with finite salt concentrations significantly deviate from a sphere (they do not show a clear plateau as the center is approached), we used a surface reconstruction method [54] to estimate the volume and concentration instead of fitting the radial density profiles/using the limiting values.” Comment: 4) Table 1: It seems that the discrepancy between the sigmoidal fit approach and the surface reconstruction approach increases with λ, possibly due to sensitivity to the shape of the droplets, illustrating that there might be significant uncertainty associated with the reported dense phase volumes. We think it would be useful to have an error estimate for the reported dense phase volumes (e.g. an error over volume calculation approaches and/or over different probe sizes). The author’s response: The volume obtained by surface reconstruction is definitely highly sensitive to the probe size. To justify the size of the probe that I used, I directly compared the sigmoidal fit protein concentrations and the surface construction protein concentration calculated by different probe sizes (Figure S3 in the old SI, Figure S6 in the revised SI). Based on that comparison, probe radius 10 A was the size that minimized the differences considering all lambda values. That’s how I justified the probe size I used. For the uncertainty/error estimates, I performed block averaging analyses (please also see the response to the point 7). Comment: 5) Table 2 and Fig. 4: We suggest that the author more explicitly states which experimental data was used for comparison with the simulations in Fig. 4. We also suggest a more direct comparison with experimental data points where possible (e.g. by showing the experimental values of csat as a function of NaCl concentration). The author’s response: We used two experimental papers to extract the experimental data, one is reference 36. In reference 36, the authors state: “Using incubation on ice to increase the driving force for droplet formation followed by centrifugation to fuse the droplets due to their higher density, our 15 ml samples of 1 mM FUS LC phase-separated to form an ∼400 μl viscous, protein-dense phase stable for weeks at room temperature. FUS LC concentration in the phase is approximately 7 mM (120 mg/ml FUS LC) as determined by spectrophotometry.“ We note that the salt concentration is not specified in this case (or the authors obtained approximately the same protein concentration in the dense phase regardless of the salt concentration). Also, the thermodynamic conditions defined here does not exactly correspond to those in our simulations. That’s partly the reason why we looked for multiple sources of experimental data. The other experimental work that we used is reference 39. In reference 39, the authors state that “The relative intensity of the glutamine side chain residue NMR resonances in the condensed phase compared to a standard concentration (100 μM) dispersed phase FUS LC suggests a concentration of 27.8 mM = 477 mg/ml in the condensed phase.” The salt concentration in the corresponding NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C in 50 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl pH 5.5. The conditions do not exactly correspond to our thermodynamic conditions, either. Since an exact match is not available in the conditions, we did not prefer to present a direct comparison of dense phase concentrations, instead, we preferred to show a range in Figure 4. We now modified the main text (Page 15, right above the Contact Maps subsection) to more explicitly state the source of the data: “The experimental data range is referenced from the work by Fawzi and coworkers; [36,39] where reference [36] measures the FUS LC concentration in the dense phase as approximately 120 mg/mL (spectroscopically) and in reference [39], a 477 mg/mL FUS LC concentration is deduced from the relative intensity of the glutamine side chain residue NMR resonances in the condensed phase (compared to a standard protein concentration in the dispersed phase, which is given as 100 μM, or 1.71 mg/mL). 477 mg/mL FUS LC dense phase has been obtained from 15 ml samples of 1 mM FUS LC solutions [36] (from which we calculated the dilute phase concentration as approximately 14.3 mg/mL). We used these dense phase and their respective dilute phase concentrations to calculate the experimental range of transfer free energy (gray-shaded areas in Figure 4).” Comment: 6) “We used the “tiny” bead type (TQ1) both for Na+ and Cl- ions”: The author should clarify the reason for and possible effects of choosing the TQ1 bead type, as TQ5 is, we think, the standard bead type for Na+ and Cl- ions in Martini 3. The author’s response: We would like to clarify that tiny refers to the bead type being Txx. We then also would like to clarify that TQ5 type was not available in the MARTINI version that we used. Ion topology file in the version that we used only had TQ1 types as the ion type.

Comment: 7) We suggest that the author, where possible, reports error estimates for the various observables, for example from block error analysis and/or repeated simulations. The author’s response: We performed block averaging analysis (using two block) for volume estimation (accordingly, the protein concentration in the dense phase) and included the error estimates in Table 1 (Page 12). We note that for most 𝜆 parameters, the error was less than 1%. But we now added the errors larger than 1% in Figure 4. We modified the Table 1 caption as: “…. Statistical errors calculated by block averaging of the data (dividing the equilibrated data into two equal blocks) are less than 1% at low 𝜆 conditions. Errors larger than 1% are reported.” Comment: 8) It would be useful to include a discussion of the effects of simulation convergence and simulation starting configurations on the reported results. The author’s response: We added a discussion of the reproducibility issue and the initial condition dependence both to the Results and Discussion section and the Conclusions section (please also see the responses to the point 1a and 1c). Comment: 9) A discussion of the potential differences in the effect of non-bonded cut-offs in the dilute and dense phase would also be useful. The author’s response: We used a fairly large cutoff distance (1.1 nm) for short-range treatment of vdW and electrostatics but a potential nonbonded cutoff effect that I can think of is the long-range treatment of electrostatics. While vdW interactions are large power of r in denominator (therefore, negligible contribution to the potential at large r), we may argue that the long-range treatment of electrostatics might be a concern in general. It is well known that the simple cutoff of electrostatic interactions introduces artifacts on phase behavior of anomalous liquids that has two distinct phases [e.g., J. Chem. Phys. 131, 104508 (2009)]. Here, we applied the reaction field method for long-range treatment of electrostatics. In this method, a given particle is assumed to be surrounded by a spherical cavity of finite radius within which the electrostatic interactions are calculated explicitly. Outside the cavity, the system is treated as a dielectric continuum. Any net dipole within the cavity induces a polarization in the dielectric, which in turn interacts with the given molecule. The reaction field method allows the replacement of the infinite Coulomb sum by a finite sum plus the reaction field. One caveat of this approach might be the nonuniform distribution of the particles within the system (i.e., one protein-dense phase and one protein-dilute phase), which may jeopardize the assumption that outside the cavity is a uniform continuum dielectric. While this caveat may make the Ewald summation (or particle mesh Ewald, faster version of Ewald sum) look more preferable, we note that Ewald sum and reaction field techniques yield nearly identical phase behavior for liquid crystals (also nonuniform in nature) (see, Molecular Physics 92(4), 723-734 (1997)). We discussed some of these points in the main text as follows (Page 6, third from the last sentence): “Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using a generalized reaction field method [45]. We note that a long-range treatment of electrostatic interactions is essential to obtain accurate phase behavior [46].” Comment: 10) It would be very useful if the inputs/settings (including starting configurations) used for simulation and code for analysis were available. The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we uploaded the initial configurations and run files for all lambda values for 0 mM salt and 100 mM to GitHub and made it publicly available. We now noted in the availability of the data in the main text by modifying the last paragraph of Modeling subsection as follows: “Equilibrated initial conditions, topology files, and run parameter files for all λ values of 0 mM and 100 mM salt are publicly available on GitHub ( https://github.com/gzerze/m... Comment: We also have the following suggestions for minor revisions to the manuscript: 1) “We kept the protein-protein interactions unmodified (and no additional elastic backbone constraints were applied)”: The author should clarify whether this includes assignment of secondary structure and/or side chain angle and dihedral restraints (ss and scfix in Martinize). The author’s response: Yes, this would apply for any restraints (i.e., they would remain unmodified). This particular protein, FUS LC, is left fully flexible, without any backbone/side chain structure. We clarified this in the main text by modifying the relevant part in the Modeling subsection: “No elastic backbone (or side chain) constraints were applied (i.e., FUS LC is kept fully flexible). We kept the protein-protein interactions unmodified but systematically tested a range of scaled protein-water interactions.” Comment: 2) “All simulations were performed using GROMACS MD engine (version 2016.3).”: Error in references. The author’s response: The references are fixed. Comment: 3) In the Cluster Formation Analysis section: We suggest that the author cites the specific package used (e.g. SciPy). The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we added the name of the routine related references by modifying the relevant part in Cluster Formation Analysis subsection as follows: “Any two protein molecules are considered to be in the same cluster if any two beads of the molecules are within 0.5 nm (or less) distance from each other. Based on this criterion, we built adjacency matrices and then found the connected components by using the compressed sparse graph routines of public Python libraries [50]” Comment: 4) Fig. 2: There are small red dots on the droplets, which should either be explained in the figure text or removed. The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we remade the Figure 2 by removing the red dots. Comment: 5) Fig. 3: It would be useful for the reader if the NaCl concentration was labelled at the top of each column. Additionally, the radial distribution of the ion concentration is shown as two separate rows, which we assume corresponds to Na+ and Cl- ions. This should be clearly labelled. The author’s response: Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we updated Figure 3 with proper labels. Comment: 6) “We found the largest water fraction For the ionic species…”: Typo? The author’s response: We removed that incomplete sentence now. Comment: 7) Fig. 4: Depending on how the plot is updated with more details on the experiments, perhaps the range shown on the y-axis could be made smaller. The author’s response: Figure 4 is updated as presented above (please see the response to point 7 above). Comment: 8) Fig. 5: May be clearer with a colourmap with three colours, as in figure 6. The author’s response: Figure 5 uses a color scale that changes the colors uniformly from black to white. For contact maps (like Figure 5), since the range of change is sequential growth of fraction, we thought a perceptually uniform sequential color scale fits better as opposed to a divergent color scale (e.g. the color scale in Figure 6).",2023-04-30T15:24:14,,Gul Zerze,10.1101/2022.11.07.515502,Optimizing the Martini 3 force field reveals the effects of the intricate balance between protein-water interaction strength and salt concentration on biomolecular condensate formation,Gül H.

The comments are posted with this preprint in the hopes the authors post the updated version that we commented on here as the journal we are reviewing for does not place limits on updating preprints during the peer review process. Ashraya Ravikumar and James Fraser Summary : The traditional Ramachandan plot uses the ϕ and ψ torsion angles about the N-C𝛼 bond and C𝛼-C bond respectively to represent aspects of the three dimensional protein backbone structure in two dimensions. Some of the atoms involved in the calculation of ϕ and ψ torsion angles of a residue come from the adjacent residues in the protein chain. In this work, the authors consider the ψ angle of residue i and ϕ angle of residue i+1 as an entity and analyze the distribution of these amino acid pairs. Their approach has the advantage of the torsion angle pair being fully contained in an amino acid pair and the ease of representation of these pairs in the familiar Ramachandran like plot. The authors show that their cross peptide bond plot covers more area than the traditional ϕ,ψ plot and identifies certain structural elements that are “recurring outliers” using the traditional plot. They also show some differences in conformational preference between thermophilic and mesophilic proteins. There is an initial attempt at experimental validation, with small stability changes (measured by melting temperature) upon point mutations to amino acids more favored for that specific region of the cross plot; however, this validation is limited and would benefit from examples intended to be neutral and destabilizing. The major strength of the paper is a new concept that is very simple yet also powerful for identifying regions of conformational space that should be considered “valid”, not outliers. In doing so, their method provides a lot of scope for some interesting future work and new ways of validating protein structures, refinement procedures, and structure predictions. The major recurring issue in the manuscript however has been lack of clarity and lack of attention to detail, which can be improved in a future (third?) iteration of the manuscript. The major and minor points of concern are expanded below: Major points : 1. In Figure 1, the authors claim that “Standard secondary structures (such as left and right 𝛼-helices, 𝛽-strands and turns) are clearly recognizable” from the gray stick plots. While the 𝛼-helices are recognizable especially in clusters 12 and 19, it is not possible to identify 𝛽-strands and turns from these images. More amino acids may have to be added to the visualization on either side of the pair to make this clear. 2. Their analysis on the correlation of cross bond angles using MD simulations need more details and discussion. The text points to Figure 2 and Table S1 to show the correlation but Figure 2 simply shows the five structures which were simulated along with the amino acid pairs and the cross peptide bond plot. It is unclear how to interpret the correlation between ϕ(k) and ψ(k+1) from this figure. Also, their choice of proteins for this analysis seems arbitrary. What do they mean by “small” protein? What is the dataset of structures they started out with before randomly picking these five structures? 3. How do the authors claim that cluster 9 and 10 shown in Figure 4 represent a transition into helix? The ϕ(k+1),ψ(k+1) distribution is not indicative of being part of a helix. 4. The authors refer to Figure 5 in their discussion about the cluster 15 representing the Type II 𝛽 turn. The representatives of the cluster do appear in different structural contexts. But, are they all indeed 𝛽 turns? Do they satisfy other criteria to be called a beta turn - either distance between C𝛼 atoms of i and i+3 residue or H bond between carbonyl oxygen of i and amide hydrogen of i+3. This information is needed to support the statement that type II 𝛽 turns are also common in random coil regions. Also, Figure 5 caption says the representatives are from cluster 6, but we are assuming the authors mean cluster 15. 5. The authors have not mentioned what is the color scale used to color the nodes in Figure 6. We are assuming that warmer color means higher probability of the cluster being occupied by thermophiles. The clusters that are part of the most prominent transitions are very close to each other. Maybe many of the amino acid pairs from thermophiles that are classified into cluster 12 could be part of cluster 19 with some minor change in ψ or ϕ angle. Are the alphafold predicted structures accurate enough to distinguish between such close ψ,ϕ angles? These observations could also be a result of inherent biases in alphafold. Perhaps the authors could also analyze experimental structures of mesophiles and thermophiles to see if these trends hold. 6. The statement “Visual inspection of the most prominent cases suggests that the preferred clusters in thermophiles, presumably the more thermostable ones, are those which appear more ordered” is not well supported. If this statement is being made purely based on the cartoon representation of the two cluster transitions shown as inset in Figure 6, then it does not look convincing, especially 1 to 11. Perhaps the authors could analyze the extent of disorder in a more systematic way by comparing preferred clusters of thermophiles and mesophiles and quantitatively look at the difference in disorder, if any. The authors can also show specific examples of transition matrix along with pictorial representations of differences in angles/planes so that the reader can understand them better. 7. In the context specific mutation analysis, the differences in ΔTm observed are very small and the raw DSF data is not shown in the supplemental figure. Are these changes significant enough to conclude about the effect of these context specific mutations on protein stability? Additional experiments are likely needed to place these ΔTm changes in context. What is the typical change in ΔTm for a predicted neutral or deleterious mutation? Can anything be inferred based on prior deep mutational scans for GFP or another protein to help give this analysis more power? 8. Over the years, Ramachandran angle restraints have become part of structure refinement protocols, which when applied inappropriately, could lead to over-optimization of ϕ-ψ angles. For such cases a simple Ramachandran validation will fail to identify issues in the structure and needs a more global approach such as the Ramachandran Z-score ( https://www.sciencedirect.c.... From the way the authors’ approach is designed, it could have potential for a similar application. They have shown in Figure 3 how outliers of Ramachandran plot fall into acceptable regions in their cross-peptide bond plot. Along these lines, the authors should discuss about global validation metrics derivable from their method (perhaps related to the normalized marginal distribution distance shown in Figure 7) Minor points : 1. In the introduction section, the authors mention the disadvantage of the (ϕ,ψ)2 method. But apart from mentioning the protein blocks (PB) method, they don’t explain how their approach improves over the PB method. It’s important to place this work in context to PB since PB’s have been used for several structure related applications. Another related work is TERMs ( https://www.sciencedirect.c... where the protein structure is broken down into smaller structural entities which are then used to assess model quality, sequence/structure compatibility, conformational transitions, etc. The authors could discuss about the relationship of between their work and TERMs 2. The authors should add labels to panels within figures instead of addressing them as top, middle, etc. 3. What is the correct resolution cut off used to extract structures from PDB? Results and discussion says 1.8Å but methods say 1.5Å. Also, the authors need to provide the list of PDB structures used. 4. The authors have probably cited the wrong reference for the proteomes of mesophile/thermophile bacterial pairs in materials and methods 5.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.25.538336v1#comment-6172790273,biorxivstage,2,"In this preprint, Bloom re-analyses a dataset of metagenomic data recently shared on open repositories by Liu et al. (2023). A subset of these data, previously made available on GISAID, was also previously analyzed by Crits-Christoph et al. (2023) – of which we are co-authors. 1) Bloom’s analysis largely confirms the genetic identification of wildlife species by Crits-Christoph et al. (2023). The identification of animal species differed between Liu et al. and Crits-Christoph et al., in particular regarding the abundance of raccoon dog genetic material in sample Q61. Bloom’s analysis, done with similar but independent methods from Crits-Christoph et al., largely replicates their findings. A comprehensive Github repository allows any interested reader to conveniently check Bloom’s results by themselves. 2) The correlation analysis presented by Bloom contains numerous flaws. Bloom reproduced the correlation analysis initially presented in Liu et al. (2022), but Bloom’s analysis, as conducted, is inappropriate to answer the question of which animal hosts shed the viral material detected. Crits-Christoph et al. (2023) were missing data to carry out such an analysis, but warned against its use. Here we repeat and expand the arguments presented in Crits-Christoph et al.. These points would need to be taken into account for a correlation analysis to be valid, but were not by Bloom (and often just cannot be): a) The outbreak had been ongoing for weeks in the market when the samples were collected, and multiple humans had been infected. By then, most virus in the market will come from human cases, especially as stalls containing human cases were targeted first, when sampling was performed on January 1. The large number of samples from these stalls with sick humans will highly influence correlational analyses. As shown in Worobey et al. (2022) on similar data obtained via qPCR, both the distance from known human cases and the distance from wildlife stalls independently contributed to the spatial variation in viral positive samples. The number of human cases at the time of sampling means that even if infected animals were present at the market, an underpowered correlation analysis of the sequencing data would be unlikely to have revealed it. b) The correlation analysis treats all animals of a given species as an homogeneous group. There were however multiple stalls selling the same animal species, but likely not from the same supply sources. The presence of uninfected animals in one stall would affect the result of a correlation analysis, but would not invalidate the potential presence of infected animals in another stall. c) The samples themselves are not homogeneous: for instance, within-sample animal diversity is different when the swab was taken directly from fish packaging than from the ground. In addition, wildlife stall samples tend to be composed of a diverse menagerie of animal species RNA/DNA (a consequence of animals housed directly on top of each other and equipment shared between them), while samples related to human cases elsewhere in the market tend to be fairly simple. Therefore, by correlating abundances within just the positive samples, human-shed samples tend to have very high relative abundances for human DNA (or, e.g., human and fish), while animal shed samples tend to have lower abundances for any given species. This is a natural consequence of sequencing abundances being relative, not absolute. d) SARS-CoV-2 read counts can differ for multiple reasons: there can be different quantities of virus shed in the first place, and different times since virus deposition will influence detection, as RNA degrades over time. While it is not possible to precisely date the time of viral deposition, there are two important considerations. First, if wildlife introduced the virus first to the market, animal-shed virus would (on average) occur before human sheddings. Second, wildlife stalls were sampled multiple days after stalls with reported cases (January 12 vs January 1). Put together, this means there would have been substantially more time for virus shed by animals to decay than virus shed by humans. e) Virus presence is detected through RNA, host presence through mtDNA, which degrade differently over time. Relative abundances therefore depend on the time difference between when the different genetic materials were deposited and when they were collected. f) Stalls were sampled multiple times. A correlation analysis would need to take into account spatial proximity and in particular model the per-stall effect. g) The correlations reported in Bloom’s figure 5 are calculated solely on samples that contained any positive reads for SARS-CoV-2, and were therefore sequencing-positive for the virus. Therefore, this is not a test of which species were more likely to be in samples that tested positive for the virus, but how abundant each species was in the samples that did test positive. This is an important distinction. For these reasons, both positive and negative correlations are largely uninterpretable: -  A positive correlation is not indicative of infection. As an enlightening example (also highlighted in Crits-Christoph et al.), the most correlated species in Bloom’s analysis is a fish species that is not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. -  A negative correlation is not indicative of lack of infection (see above). 3) Some samples appear to be missing in the analysis, which contained high viral read numbers: A20, F13, F54. 4) Bloom chose to align reads to chordates’ mitochondrial genomes, but did not justify this choice. Only mammals are known to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, so an analysis of just mammalian RNA/DNA, as presented in Crits-Christoph et al., is most relevant to the question of which species may have shed the virus in a particular sample. If the aim was to provide a better picture of the diversity of animals sold at the Huanan market, all metazoa should have been included, to be able to identify seafood for instance (a key early case was a shrimp seller). However, the end result is that Bloom’s 20% chordate inclusion threshold for this table results in most of the samples with both wildlife RNA/DNA (e.g. raccoon dogs) and viral RNA being excluded. The claim that only one sample of all samples with raccoon dog DNA that contains SARS-CoV-2 is therefore inaccurate: please see the supplementary data of either Crits-Christoph et al. or Bloom et al. for comparative results on the true number of such samples (which is at least 5, depending on the given analysis). 5) Bloom’s comments on the definition of positive samples overlook the difference in sensitivity between qPCR and sequencing in environmental sampling: qPCR is highly sensitive, with near single molecule detection resolution, and correlates with the absolute load of the virus in the sample. Sequencing, however, is both less sensitive (even when deeply sequencing), and highly dependent on the quantity of what else is in the sample. Thus, it is very challenging to identify SARS-CoV-2 in samples sequenced from the environment without any kind of enrichment performed: this is because the virus is comparatively rare compared to abundant environmental microbes (bacteria, fungi) as well as DNA/RNA shed by animals and humans. This is why most environmental viral sequencing is done after performing a viral enrichment (either physical or amplicon). For a similar comparison of unenriched SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, see the supplementary table S1 of Crits-Christoph et al. 2021 (“Genome Sequencing of Sewage Detects Regionally Prevalent SARS-CoV-2 Variants”), where 5 unenriched samples with viral Ct values in the range of 30-32 were deeply sequenced, and only 1-17 SARS-CoV-2 reads were obtained. For this reason, we do not encourage using only sequencing data quantitative values and ignoring qPCR positive samples. There is no indication in the Liu et al. dataset that we have seen to indicate the qPCR results were impacted by contamination. Indeed, 112/116 samples that were reported negative for qPCR were also negative by NGS, indicating a high degree of agreement between the two approaches, and that qPCR is merely more sensitive. In addition, the definition of a positive sample cannot be done independently of the provenance of the sample: even at very low read count, the presence of other positive samples in the same stall at the same date is indicative of sample positivity. 6) Citations to news articles are vague or misleading. It would be preferable to stick to arguments presented in scientific documents, rather than rely on newspaper articles. a) As rationale for his analysis, in the Introduction of his preprint, Bloom claims that “Other scientists pointed out that if the raw data were shared, it would be possible to expand upon the analysis in the 2022 Chinese CDC preprint to determine if the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material correlated with material from other species (Cohen 2022a,b)”, where the two Cohen citations are news articles. The authors quoted in these articles (Robertson, Rambaut, Holmes) did not mention Figure 4a because they thought the analysis was useful enough to be reproduced, but because it was possible that other animals’ genetic material was present in the environmental samples, and these data were not shown. b) By conflating their views with misinterpretations of news reports written about their work, Bloom misrepresents the conclusions of Crits-Christoph (2023): Crits-Christoph et al. (2023) did not conclude they had found the intermediate host and it was raccoon dogs: their report clearly stated that they could not “identify the intermediate animal host species from these data”, and that the presence of infected animals was a “plausible explanation” for their results. And they explicitly stated that “the most abundant animal in the sequencing data of a particular sample is not necessarily the source of the virus in that sample”.

My comments are below: Sweeny and colleagues describe a method which identifies the location and conformation of small molecule ligands within cryoEM volumetric maps of ligand:target complexes in an automated manner, given an atomic model of the macromolecular target only. The method, named ChemEM, is shown to match or exceed the performance of existing, commonly-used methods in its ability to successfully locate and model energetically favorable and structurally accurate conformations of ligands. Such a tool will be of keen interest to structural biologists working on small molecule ligands, for example in the context of drug discovery projects supported by cryoEM. In such projects, protein:ligand co-structures typically have resolutions in the 2.5 to 3.6 Å range, leaving some ambiguity as to the exact position of ligand atoms, and thus the conformation of the small molecule and the details of its interaction with the protein binding site. The authors achieved impressive performance, as judged by well-defined benchmarks, by introducing several key features, including: (1) a carefully calibrated function to score the geometric and chemical plausibility of ligand and ligand-protein conformations, termed ChemDock (2) a measure of quality-of-fit carefully weighted relative to ChemDock as as to optimize performance in benchmarks (3) the use of mutual information (MI) rather than the more commonly-used cross-correlation coefficient (CCC) as a quality-of-fit measure (4) the use of difference maps rather than full cryoEM maps as input for the docking and initial conformational search In addition to point (3) above, the manuscript is replete with technical nuggets that will be of interest to those working directly in this field (e.g. the use of full vs difference map, the relative weighting of model-only vs model-map scoring functions and its calibration, the creation of cryoEM benchmarking sets). Overall, I found no major technical issues with the description of the work. I found the methodological details are well described, as are their tuning, benchmarking and validation. Most of the claims are well supported by evidence, and the results do appear impressive. The manuscript appears close to publishable to my eyes. I do have some suggestions for improvements: (1) I found the following were missing: A description of the software and end-user experience. What inputs are needed? What is the interface like? The authors claim that ChemEM is automated... is it truly fully automated in a robust way? How many parameters does the user need to adjust? For example, are difference maps calculated automatically by ChemEM? Are the maps filtered, or their spectra flattened or normalized in any way, before computing difference maps and MI?  Also, what is the performance like? Relatedly, the authors really should specify: How is the software available? How is it distributed? Under what license? Oh and also: does ChemEM handle covalent ligands? (2) Q scores (or equivalent metric) should be included when making comparative statements about the quality of (ligand) model-to-map agreement (e.g. Fig 6A, but Figs 5 and 6 in general, and references to them in the text, e.g. ""markedly better fit to the density than the cryoEM deposited structure"") (3) The abstract claims that SM docking into medium resolution maps is ""unexplored territory"". I don't think this is accurate. For example, the glideEM paper treats EMD-0488 (3.4 Å). (4) Introduction: the sentence which cites reference 2 seems inaccurate to me. As far as I could tell from a brief review of the cited work, it does not identify a novel drug target. GABA receptors were already known to be the targets of the small molecules studied in that paper. In general, I fail to see how higher resolution structures by cryoEM would help identify new targets (proteins) for small molecule drugs. In my opinion the suggestions above really should be addressed before publication. In addition the suggestions below would improve the manuscript further and may be acted upon if the authors/editors agree: (5) Up to the editor, but this is a very technical paper. It might be worth investing a few sentences here and there to help non-specialist readers along. For example, when referring to CASF-2016's ""funnel"" and the related decoy or ""RMSD"" ligand sets, or when first referring to mutual information. The non-expert reader likely will not know exactly what these are and some short descriptions may help. Generally, given the target journal, a bit more effort to write for a broader audience might be warranted. (6) Figure 4: perhaps label/title the figure panels themselves with ""Different maps"" (left column) / ""Full maps"" (right column) and ""Low-resolution maps"" (bottom row) / ""High-resolution maps"" (top row). And also, in the MI-only case with different maps - what was the initial conformation of the ligand (which I assume was held constant)? Was it a minimized-in-vacuum conformation? (7) A detail: I have a preference for avoiding the word ""density"" when referring to cryoEM maps, since they do not map electron density like x-ray maps do. (8) Abstract: to claim that automatically docking ligands is of ""utmost importance"" I think is an overblown claim. Automation is important in high throughput applications, such as fragment screening, but otherwise automation is just as desirable in ligand docking & refining as it is in protein structure building, which is to say (in my opinion) not of utmost importance. Accuracy is. (9) Abstract: ""ChemEM is a novel method"". I'm not dogmatic about this, I think it's OK to claim novelty from time to time, but in this case, only some aspects of the method are really novel, and I think the claim of novelty sounds a bit hollow because it is applied in such a broad stroke. In view of the quality of the results, it's not even necessary. (10) Abstract: The last sentence ""ChemEM unlocks the potential of medium-resolution cryo-EM structures for drug discovery""... Again this claim is actually really quite strong but sounds quite hollow in this case, at least to someone who has been doing medium-resolution cryoEM for drug discovery for some years. I would strike such boombastic language unless some more specific statement can be made about some type of experiment of projects that was not previously possible until ChemEM came along and is now ""unlocked"". (11) Signicance statement: is ChemEM already used in drug discovery?? Is it even available for download from anywhere? Maybe just say ""which can be used used in drug discovery""; ""In the last decade Cryo-electron microscopy"": the capitalization is unecessary here. Also, because the electrons are not cryogenic, I recommend using ""cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM or cryo-EM)"". (12) Introduction, second paragraph: ""high- and low-resolution"": Hyphenation is not warranted here. I would say ""at both high and low resolutions"". If you really like the hyphen, try something like ""in both high- and low-resolution regimes"". (13) Introduction, penultimate paragraph: ""there is no data that compares"" should be ""there are no data that compare"" (14) Evaluation of the ChemDock scoring function: ""and of these a correct pose"": Is correct pose different from correct conformation? The way the sentence is written suggests so, but I suspect not. Perhaps simplify the syntax to avoid confusion? (15) Analysis of specific examples. Last paragraph: If I understood correctly, the authors know this is not the correct solution because it doesn't match the high-resolution control structure. I guess the top panel of Fig 6D shows PDB 6T24. Did the authors consider adding a panel showing the ""correct"" conformation form the high-resolution PDB? (16) Discussion. First sentence. The need for automation is dominant perhaps only during fragment screening campaigns and the like. My view is that the accuracy (RMSD to ground truth) & quality (low strain) of the poses found by ChemEM are impressive, even without considering the automation. I would suggest ""accurately and automatically"". (17) ""our benchmark only cases better than 4.5Å"": ""only includes cases"" (word missing)? (18) M&M. Computational datasets. First sentence: ""Data to train the ChemDock scoring function was taken"" should be ""were taken"" (19) M&M. Computational datasets. First paragraph. Of the remaining 3,281 complexes, did any of them have close matches in the CASF-2016 dataset? For example, small molecule ligands bound to the same protein target, in the same pocket and with similar (but not identical) chemical structure to one in the CASF-2016 dataset? If so, then the training and test datasets may not be sufficiently independent. (20) Page 14. ""The data was split"" should be ""The data were split"" (21) Page 18.

I’d still like to add a few comments: a) In my opinion, your statement that “raccoon dogs are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2” (SC2) requires further limitations. It was never shown that SC2 strains that circulated at the Huanan seafood market can infect raccoon dogs. Barua et al (1) conclude that minks are only susceptible for SC2 variants that have the D614G or other enhancing mutations. The only study that ever showed that at least some raccoon dogs can be infected if 2ml of viral supernatant are inocculated intranasally (Freuling et al (2)) used a D614G SC variant. According to a personal conversation with Dr. Freuling, they were unaware of the relevance of D614G and no other virus was available at the time. As opposed to thousands of other animals, no infected wild raccoon dogs were ever found. b) Freuling et al detected approximately 10,000 fold lower maximal viral loads in raccoon dog nasal swaps as compared to viral loads in human nasal swaps (3). Thus, even in samples containing much less human than raccoon dog nucleic acids, the SC2 RNA is more likely to come from a human. c) As you mention, Liu et al state that human DNA was removed. As far as I know, commercially available kits do not differentiate between human and animal DNA. However, it is obvious that animal DNA in most cases could have come from blood (raccoon dogs were also butchered at some markets), while human DNA would likely have come from saliva (skin/hair particles are usually filtered out). DNA from blood is known to be much more stable as compared to DNA from other fluids (4), likely as it can be stabilized in coagulated particles. This could lead to a selective removal of human nucleic acids. d) Steve Massey found that sample Q61 contains significantly more reads from human common cold viruses than from SC2 (5). It is not plausible that those came from a raccoon dog. Maybe you would like to contact him and ask if he would like to publish this. e) Your Figure 4 nicely shows that for every species except for human there are some “high SC2/no resp. species” nucleic acid samples. This could be even be more informative than a correlation, as there were so many more humans that animals at the market, of which most were likely non-infected, and as human nucleic most certainly did not come from blood (comment c). f) It is could be interesting to figure out how old respective animal reads were by determining RNA/DNA ratios. I am no expert here, but this could be done by comparing coding strand/non-coding strand reads or exon/intron reads.

Here are some suggestions that I have: 1) The statistics in this paper should be represented differently, using a more consistent and coherent system. In addition, due to some of the data seeming to be non-normally distributed, a different statistical test should be used. A Friedman One Way Repeated Measure Analysis of Variance by Ranks may be a test to look into, as I believe this would allow for comparison between all groups while taking into account the distribution of the data. The statistical analysis should also be elaborated on more in the methods section. 2) The methods for administering the shear stress should be reconsidered, using more consistent controls. For example, the control (static condition) should incorporate the cone on top of the cells to control for any effects this may have on the cell phenotypes. The addition of medium to the cells may also impact the results. If possible, a different set up could be considered to more accurately reflect the in vivo conditions of blood flowing through the veins/arteries/heart since these are the biomedical applications discussed in the paper. For example, flowing fluid through a tube with cells to cause shear stress rather than spinning the fluid to cause shear stress.

The evidence for this notion is weak: the infection of olfactory receptor neurons is extremely rare (see, e.g., Butowt et al., 2021: https://link.springer.com/a.... The cells shown in your Fig. 3B are apparently not mitral cells located in the mitral cell layer, where label would be expected if the virus or virus proteins were transferred along the olfactory glomeruli. Other studies (e.g. Khan et al., 2021 in Cell: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go... have also described the location of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins as being outside the olfactory bulb parenchyma (“Consistent with the absence of evidence for infection of OSNs, we failed to find evidence for viral invasion of the OB parenchyma.“) I am surprised that you do not consider a more plausible explanation for the neuro-invasion that is evident on the ventromedial aspect of the olfactory bulb. The data you present are much more consistent with a transfer of SARS-CoV-2 along the nervus terminalis which has cell bodies scattered along the ventromedial aspect of the olfactory bulb – see, for example Wiechmann et al., 2018: ( https://www.researchgate.ne.... An uptake and transport of the virus or its proteins within the nervus terminalis is more likely than in the olfactory nerve, because the majority of the nervus terminalis neurons express ACE2, the virus entry protein – unlike the olfactory receptor neurons (Bilinska et al., 2021: https://www.frontiersin.org.... The presence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the hypothalamus of your hamsters also points to this route, since the nervus terminalis directly projects to this target. Recent studies support the idea that the nervus terminalis is a more plausible route of SARS-CoV-2 neuro-invasion than the olfactory nerve (Butowt and von Bartheld, 2022: https://molecularneurodegen.... I agree with your main conclusion, that neuro-invasion and anosmia occur independent from each other, but for the more simple reason: neuro-invasion likely follows the nervus terminalis, while anosmia is caused by elimination of the support cells in the olfactory epithelium (Butowt et al., Trends Neurosci 2023: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go....",2023-04-27T00:20:40,christophervonbartheld,Christopher von Bartheld,10.1101/2022.08.31.505985,Neuroinvasion and anosmia are independent phenomena upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 and its variants,"Guilherme Dias de Melo, Victoire Perraud, Flavio Alvarez, Alba Vieites-Prado, Seonhee Kim, Lauriane Kergoat, Anthony Coleon, Bettina Salome Trüeb, Magali Tichit, Aurèle Piazza, Agnès Thierry, David Hardy, Nicolas Wolff, Sandie Munier, Romain Koszul, Etienne Simon-Lorière, Volker Thiel, Marc Lecuit, Pierre-Marie Lledo, Nicolas Renier, Florence Larrous, Hervé Bourhy",2023-04-19

Most diseases involve the connection of numerous coordinated host systems. While it is known that numerous host systems, including the nervous systems, are involved with distal disease sites, research has been limited to investigate single organs. In the present manuscript, the researchers sought to develop an imaging method (wildDISCO) in whole mice bodies to visualize the distribution and association of cell types within hosts. Using wildDISCO, researchers were able to develop a method to investigate through microscopy the nervous, immune, and lymphatic systems. In addition to validating the methodology, the researchers demonstrated the nerve connections between different organs, a previous limitation to whole-organ microscopy. Additionally, they demonstrate that there is co-localization of immune cells with vagus and sympathetic nerves in the inferior mesenteric plexus and intestinal wall, respectively. Finally, using germ-free mice, the study determined the nerve lattice structure is less dense compared to mice harboring a gut microbiota, highlighting the importance of the gut microbiota in the development of the mesenteric plexus. Therefore, wildDISCO is a useful technology that can not only be used for physiological research, but also fully understand the cellular dynamics within whole mice during various diseases. Positive feedback. The present study addresses a long standing limitation to the field of whole-organ microscopy, allowing researchers to now address organ connectivity of various systems. As such, the manuscript was well organized and the microscopy was clear in demonstrating the various principles investigated. Specifically, the microscopy for PGP9.5 and LYVE1 truly demonstrates the distribution and connectivity of nerves within whole mice, a tremendous feature not previously investigated before. In addition to the physiological questions addressed in the manuscript, the in vivo experiment demonstrating the influence of the gut microbiota in the development of the sympathetic nervous system was particularly exciting. The results present in the manuscript provide crucial insights into the interconnection of host systems within mice and allow other researchers to begin to address these insights. Major Concerns The graphical abstract needs to be more clarified for where cholesterol depletion is occurring within these mice Throughout the manuscript, analysis of the results is often missing. If the authors could include their interpretation of the results at the end of each figure, it would help readers understand. Figure 1C - The methylene blue staining of mouse brains should be quantified. The present microscopy is difficult to see on paper and staining looks similar across treatment groups. Figure 4A - the authors state there is substantial co-localization of immune cells with vagus nerves and sympathetic nerves, could this be quantified by the authors? Perhaps the percentage of CD45+ signal which localize to the nerves? The results section for figure 5 is missing from the manuscript. This should be added to the manuscript. Minor concerns The gut-brain axis has been investigated heavily. In the germ free mice, were there changes in the development of nerves in the brains? If the authors could talk more about this technology in the discussion section and how this could be applicable to other physiological systems or diseases, I think that would help the manuscript. Figure 1B - CD2 appears to perform cholesterol depletion, but is not mentioned in the text. The authors should discuss this finding.

The abstract provides a clear background on the antibody-dependent enhancement issue in DENV pathogenesis and its impact on vaccine development. The objectives of the study are also well-defined. However, I recommend adding a brief explanation of saturation mutagenesis and directed evolution for readers who may not be familiar with these techniques. It is interesting to note the development of the D2-FL and D2-FLM variants that evade both pre-membrane and fusion-loop antibodies. I suggest providing more information on the functional analysis and characterization of these engineered variants, including any potential impact on viral fitness, replication, or virulence. The observation of lower neutralization titers against D2-FL and D2-FLM in heterotypic serum compared to isogenic wildtype DENV2 is an important finding. However, it would be helpful to include some quantitative data or statistical analysis to support this observation. In the conclusion, you propose the use of D2-FL and D2-FLM as tools for delineating cross-reactive antibody subtypes and as a platform for safer live attenuated DENV vaccines. While this is a promising application, it would be valuable to discuss any preliminary data or experiments that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these engineered viruses in vivo.

The authors generate a good null expectation for motifs in a GRN by modeling random degree-preserving unscaled networks and counting motifs. We wondered, however, whether random unduplicated networks are the appropriate null. Simple duplication of all the nodes in a network, where each node maintains its links, will create a network with bilateral symmetry. This symmetry will give rise to symmetrical motifs – for example two nodes connected by a directed link will generate a bifan motif when duplicated. Over time, or after random perturbations to the links and nodes in the network, this bifan could be degraded to form triangular motifs like the V and lambda motifs. Because duplication creates new motifs, the expected number of motifs should be much higher in a duplicated GRN created by whole genome duplication. A symmetrical null model should capture this higher motif frequency. Testing hypotheses with a revised null model could yield exciting results and address additional questions: . Is the observation of motif enrichment an inevitable consequence of network duplication? Is the search for motifs with bilateral symmetry why patterns in Solanum – the result of a triplication – are an exception to the observed patterns? A fair bit of the discussion focuses on the timing of polyploidy. Here we felt it would help readers to introduce them earlier to the ages of the different polyploidy events studied. We also felt the authors could do more to distinguish between the age and number of polyploidy events – in their examples, species with “newer” polyploidy events were also those with the largest number of total events, for example. And even the newest events are many millions of years old – is a 5myo polyploidy event expected to be much different from a 15 or 30myo event? Throughout, we felt there were places where explicit hypotheses would help the reader. What are the predictions made by different models of duplication and evolution? Do we expect these to differ qualitatively or quantitatively between GRNs and PPI? Do we have predictions about which GO terms might be significant and why? (e.g. why should stress genes hang around longer?). Laying these out would especially be helpful for biologists less familiar with networks and the gene balance hypothesis and their comparisons. The authors compare duplicates from WGD to those from SSD, but neither group is homogeneous. Whole genome duplications may be the result of allopolyploidy or autopolyploidy, which could impact the detection of different motifs. It would be useful for the authors to discuss the implications of the type of ancestral WGD event and how it could bias their detection of motifs and subsequent findings. Additionally, the software developed by the authors’ research group, `doubletrouble`, appears to separate SSDs into 4 categories (tandem, proximal, transposed, and dispersed duplications). Would we expect patterns for the various types of SSDs to differ? Is the variation depicted in Figure 2 for the SSD-derived gene pairs a result of variation between SSD classes or other types of noise? Finally, we wondered how large-scale duplications of multiple genes or even aneuploidy might lead to different results, especially if there is any clustering of genes by function.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.06.535924v1#comment-6167282460,biorxivstage,3,"The manuscript entitled: “Layer Dependence of Monocular and Binocular Responses in Human Ocular Dominance Columns at 7T using VASO and BOLD” is an exciting manuscript describing a high-resolution VASO study to measure laminar and columnar signal variations in V1. This study uses an extraordinary experimental setup with some most advanced imaging hardware and some of the most advanced sequences, and custom built stimulation equipment. It touches on some of the most important issues of the field of high-resolution imaging, including. Finding a good compromise of sensitivity and specificity, Multimodal sequences (VASO and BOLD) and how to combine signals across them. Using NORDIC noise cleaning, which is a hot topic in the field and many researchers are looking at how this develops. Simultaneous columnar and laminar imaging. In my understanding this is a methods-focused study that investigates these topics in the ‘testbed’ of ocular dominance columns. I believe this is an appropriate model, as it has been previously established for such purposes:  E.g. Kemper et al. (2018, see Fig. 2 for simultaneous columnar and laminar features) and Feinberg et al. (2018, see Fig. 7-8 for ODC across depth). And also see (Hollander et al., 2021) (Zaretskaya 2020) (Qian 2023) (Haenelt 2020). Simultaneous columnar and laminar analyses aside of ODC are more sparse:  E.g. De Martino et al. (2015) in the auditory cortex, Huber et al (2020) in the sensorimotor system, and  Schneider et al. (2019) in V5/MT+. I see many strengths of the paper: -> The study uses advanced experimental setups. -> There is a nice inherent reproducibility happening in this study. Each result is reproduced for left and right eyes/columns, respectively. -> The authors succeed in transparently describing the data in a relatively raw form. E.g. showing voxel-wise activation maps, showing single contrast responses (not only differential responses). This helps the reader to appreciate the raw data quality. Unfortunately, in recent years it has become too common to solely show high level end results as abstract line plots. This paper does not have such shortcomings. However, this might mean that some readers might wonder why voxels were not selected as contrast responses ( e.g. left vs. right). I think there is one minor point of potential confusion. I have talked to two colleagues about what they think about the preprint and both brought this up. If the authors agree, they could clarify the potential danger of double-dipping (or lack thereof): The authors select voxels based on the response to a given eye. Then they use these voxels to test if the response to the same eye is stronger than to another eye. This might be perceived as circular. Thus even in random noise, those voxels will have a non-zero mean bias, based on their selection criteria. I think there are many steps and controls that the authors do that mitigate the danger of double dipping: -> The voxels are selected on a single contrast, while the subsequent conclusion about the contrast difference. But even doing so, there might still be a stronger bias in one condition than the other condition. -> BOLD results speak against the danger of double dipping. The voxels that are selected for left eye responses end up showing even stronger responses for the right eye (Fig. 4B). If there would be a danger of double-dipping the result would be the other way around. Or maybe with a different voxel selection, the right-eye dominance in this plot would be even stronger. -> The authors also analyze the BOLD data in the voxels that have been selected from the VASO signal. And they reproduce the result that the eye-selectivity is stronger in VASO than BOLD. Though, there might be a residual noise coupling between VASO and BOLD via the BOLD correction procedure. The authors could consider discussing the danger of double dipping. If their data size allows, they should perform the voxel selection and the contrast testing on independent parts of the dataset. Typos and stylistic comments: -> The TR is given as the inversion-recovery TR of 3294ms. Technically this is referring to the time of acquiring two volumes plus inversion delay. This number refers to the effective temporal resolution but does not refer to the COBIDAS definition of a TR, which would be the acquisition of each volume (e.g. like the TR definition in ASL sequences). Maybe it would be clearer to call it TR_pair or something like this? -> It would be great to mention the matrix size (or FOV). This way the reader can appreciate the advanced protocol of 0.7mm resolution. -> It would be great to mention the phase encoding direction. I suspect that the head gradient allows read directions in A>>P direction, which is usually prohibited by PNS for body gradients. -> It would be informative to mention the NORDIC version (e.g. github release number). There have been some differences and improvements for later versions. -> The application of layer-specific smoothing can be reasonable. Especially, if the SNR of non-BOLD contrasts at 0.7mm is otherwise too low to see anything. But it might still appear strange to some naive readers without any justification. Maybe the authors can include a sentence or two giving slightly more background. E.g. stating that this moothing should not affect the direction differential modulations (only reduce the effect size a bit, maybe). Or stating that this is necessary due to the unconventionally small voxel sizes? -> It’s a matter of style who to cite and not to cite and it does not change the results nor the credibility of the conclusions. The authors could consider including more references of previous studies that did simultaneous laminar and columnar OCD fMRI in humans (e.g. listed above). -> “Martino” should be “De Martino” -> GREASE should be GRASE. -> The end of 2.4.1 states that a binary mask was used to confine the voxels. It might help the reproducibility to add a little more detail. Was this a GM ROI? Was this an anatomically defined V1 mask? -> The manuscript states that the columns are shown on Fig. 3. This figure shows surface maps. So, it is not clear how consistent the pattern is across cortical depths and the pattern really refers to columnar structures. Maybe the authors can include a brief statement that is shown in Fig. 3. Is this the signal averaged across cortical depth? Is it referring to the signal in the middle layer? -> In the field of layer-fMRI there are many common procedures on how the signal pooling is done which leads to different results ( https://twitter.com/layerfM.... I think each approach is justifiable. Here it is done on a voxel-specific level. This means that BOLD and VASO might have different numbers of voxels across depths. I do not think that this is a concern here because the authors look at both contrasts in either set of voxels. But it might help the reader if it’s explicitly mentioned whether the numbers of voxels per layer are substantially different. -> WM voxels in Fig. 2B. It might appear weird to inexperienced readers why VASO has so much ‘activity’ in white matter. Since the activation threshold is at 0, this is not concerning. Even for random noise, half of WM should be visible as ‘active’. Given that the GRADSMOOTH is isotropic in WM and linearly-oriented in GM the effective smoothing is different across tissue types. Maybe it would make sense to include a short explanation on how to interpret the WM voxels? -> Some readers might be spoiled by overly beautiful and clear tiny parallel stripes that hit the V1/V2 border in a perpendicular direction (e.g. Nasr 2016). This is not so clearly visible here. Maybe it’s worth considering to justify this. e.g.  highlight that the resolution here is substantially higher and that the sequence is non-BOLD. Unlike previous studies, this allows vein free interpretation of depth profiles. This is a different goal than obtaining the most beautiful vein-enhanced surface maps. -> The introduction states “veins blur both the laminar and columnar BOLD responses”. The word “blur” could be specified. E.g. “distort” or “misplace” would be good alternatives. I hope to see this manuscript published in a highly respected journal. _________________ The above letter is a summary of a zoom call between Federico De Martino and Renzo Huber.

We acknowledge that there can be advantages to pseudobulk methods, and that no single method is likely to outperform all others in all settings. As the technologies and methods used in our paper are now over four years old, in a rapidly moving field, we expect many newer analyses will be able to clearly outperform previous papers in the field, including ours. More broadly, we encourage students and practitioners to revisit previous papers as a general practice of open science, and to share the results in open, respectful, and transparent ways, which can move the field forward collaboratively and constructively. That said, in this particular case, Murphy et al.'s results fall short of their claims, and they fail to demonstrate any advantages of their approach compared to our manuscript, due to several technical and logical mistakes in their analysis, which we outline here: http://compbio.mit.edu/scAD... Briefly: * Murphy et al. do not compare to our actual 1,031 reported differentially expressed genes (DEGs), they exclude our mixed-model results from their comparison, thus misinterpreting our work as cell-level-only with 14,274 DEGs, which is a misrepresentation of our results. * They interpret any differences between their results and ours as improvements (conflating false positives with true predictions and lack of power with specificity) without providing any independent support – by contrast, our paper validated our DEGs using both targeted experiments and comparison with previous human and animal studies. * Their central claim that our reported DEGs are false positives lacks any substance: indeed, they are not found by their pseudobulk method, but they could simply be missed due to lack of power, and Murphy et al. provide no independent evidence that their method is sensitive or accurate. * Conversely, the 16 DEGs that they do report lack any independent evidence that they are biologically meaningful, and Murphy et al. provide no evidence that their method is specific. In fact, their 16 DEGs show unrealistically-high ~1200% median changes, and only implicate the rarest cell types, suggesting they may represent false positives stemming from unaddressed statistical artifacts due to outliers and small cell counts. * Murphy et al. also make general claims about the advantages of pseudobulk methods by applying only one method, erroneously, to only one dataset, without any benchmarks, and without comparison to current state-of-the-art methods, while misusing statistical terminology. * Lastly, they overstate their previous results from a similar Matters Arising commentary, which also advocated for pseudobulk using the same pattern of only analyzing a single dataset, methodological shortcomings, overstated conclusions, and not addressing corrections suggested by the original authors. This is a helpful example to discuss potential pitfalls in comparing bioinformatic pipelines, and to recommend perhaps more constructive strategies for such comparisons, including: applying candidate methods to more than one dataset, comparing to the actual results of the original paper without misrepresenting them, using independent validation metrics to evaluate differences instead of assuming that they are all improvements, using well-established and rigorous benchmarks, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methodologies, scrutinizing their own predictions for potential confounders, and seeking to understand the biological or technical drivers of potential differences.

The paper ameliorates apparent discrepancies between previously published in vivo and in vitro results, where N. gonorrhoeae expressing opaD are isolated from host neutrophil-rich secretions, but are killed when infecting neutrophils in vitro. The current study establishes a novel, complement-independent, protective role for C4BP against neutrophil activity. Thus, the work clarifies a major paradox in the field. The manuscript was a pleasure to read. It is logically laid out and clearly presented. The conclusions are well supported by the data. We have only minor suggestions to help improve some aspects of clarity: Minor Comments 1. On line 34, the authors state that there are 98 million cases annually of gonorrhea world-wide while on line 47 they state that there are 86.9 million cases. If the numbers refer to different things, the authors should describe the distinction. 2. Figure 1A and 1B both include data showing the proportion of surviving cells with 25% serum at 60 minutes, but those percentages are rather different: ~70% in Figure 1A and ~30% in Figure 1B. Is this variability due to differences in serum used or does it simply reflect variability in the measurement? 3. In Figure 2A, the authors test the ability of serum from different animal species to inhibit ROS production. Chimpanzees have been used to model gonorrhea infection, so it would be interesting to see how chimpanzee serum compares to human serum in this experiment. 4. Figure 5F is slightly confusing. Are the authors suggesting that if a bacterium is associated with a neutrophil, it will be taken up no matter what? A more detailed description of the experiment in the text would help clarify this. 5. Is C4BP known for being able to survive heat-inactivation without being denatured? If so, the authors should state this. 6. The rationale for using salt fractionation could be explained more clearly. 7. C4BP and OpaD play a major role when neutrophils are present. Can the authors speculate on how these proteins fit into the full pathogenic cycle? For example, where do they place among other processes that prevent killing by neutrophils?",2023-04-20T13:58:02,disqus_y9FR6hyg5J,Joseph Wade,10.1101/2022.12.08.519701,Neisseria gonorrhoeae co-opts C4b-binding protein to enhance complement-independent survival from neutrophils,"Lacie M.

As we have extensively documented and published, antigen retention during sequential staining process is as crucial as an efficient antibody stripping ( doi:10.1369/0022155417719419 ). Having shown that boiling in retrieval buffer, 6M Urea and a pH 2 glycine buffer do not remove all bound antibodies ( doi:10.1369/0022155414536732 ), we published that both bound antibody and tissue antigen conformation needs to be preserved over cycling: disaccharides provide such protection ( doi:10.1369/0022155415616162 ). Antibodies survive >30 cycles of staining and stripping with the MILAN protocol ( https://doi.org/10.21203/rs...) and only 3 out of 314 are selectively inactivated by the 2ME/SDS buffer. Thus the relatively high number of antibodies who fail to stain later in the cycles after antigen retrieval has no other explanation than antigen re-masking. The key problem NM Claudio and colleagues face is that the ethanol step required to remove the chromogen will probably denature and precipitate in-situ bound antibodies, making them available to detection in the next step, as they document. Disaccharides are insoluble in ethanol, therefore tertiary structure protection is at risk during this step. We suggest to use the MILAN protocol to strip bound antibodies before the chromogen inactivation step.",2023-04-16T08:12:08,giorgio_cattoretti,Giorgio Cattoretti,10.1101/2023.04.13.536793,Sequential chromogenic immunohistochemistry: spatial analysis of lymph nodes identifies contact interactions between plasmacytoid dendritic cells and plasmablasts,"N.M.

The current study investigates the mechanisms by which plasmids can be transiently maintained, in the presence of targeting by a CRISPR-Cas system. The paper supports the idea that the plasmid and intact CRISPR-Cas system are not compatible within a single bacterium, and identifies loss of CRISPR spacers and mutations in cas9 as mechanisms that facilitate plasmid retention. The experiments in this paper are straightforward and the conclusions drawn are well supported by the data. Some more description of the WT1 population would be helpful. Also, we found the format of Figure 2 to be confusing, and we suggest a simpler representation that focuses on the specific spacers that are lost rather than the order of spacers in the CRISPR array. Lastly, the discussion does not compare the mechanisms described here with those observed in previous studies looking at bacteria with self-targeting spacers. Major comments 1. It is unclear which genetic changes in the WT1 population lead to plasmid retention. The authors should discuss this in more detail. 2. The layout of Figure 2 is difficult to understand, for three reasons. First, the way the data are represented is not clearly explained in the Figure. If the authors choose to keep Figure 2 as a main figure, we recommend adding Figure S3 as a panel in Figure 2. Second, as the authors discuss, there are weaknesses associated with using p-values rather than simple abundance (i.e., Figure S4). The abundance numbers appear to tell the full story. Third, the authors do not explain why the order of spacers in the array is important, as opposed to the presence/absence of specific spacers. We suggest showing only the frequency of detection for individual spacers, rather than spacer pairs. 3. The authors do not compare the mechanisms discovered here to those described in previous studies that look at self-targeting spacers. We suggest including PMID 23637624 in that discussion as well as the authors’ own work. Minor comments 1.

In this study, they investigate the significance of type 2 immunity as a means of protecting the host against pathogenic helminths. On the other hand, pathologic type 2 immune responses are responsible for the development and maintenance of allergic diseases. In order to facilitate the creation of efficient methods for avoiding or treating these very widespread illnesses, it is vital to decipher the mechanisms that guide type 2 immunity. In mucosal tissues, type 2 responses are responsible for regulating allergic reactions and immunity to helminths. However, the processes that govern these cells are not well known, despite the fact that tuft cells are critical immune system regulators for type 2 immunity. This study investigates the mechanism by which intestinal tuft cells are diminished by commensal bacteria that produce butyrate. Butyrate's ability to inhibit tuft cells required the presence of the epigenetic enzyme known as histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). This finding suggests that HDAC3 may play a role in the promotion of tuft cell-dependent immunity. Epithelial-intrinsic HDAC3 actively controlled the growth of tuft cells in vivo and was required for the induction of type 2 immune responses after helminth infection. Curiously, butyrate blocked stem cell differentiation into tuft cells epigenetically, and inhibition of HDAC3 was sufficient to suppress tuft cell proliferation in adult mice and human intestinal organoids. Both of these findings are intriguing. These findings show a novel level of control that commensal bacteria use to calibrate intestinal immunity and disclose an epigenetic route in stem cells that governs tuft cell development. In addition, these findings shed information on how stem cells regulate tuft cell differentiation. It has been shown that the composition of microbiota is linked to the onset of a variety of chronic inflammatory illnesses, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, and allergic rhinitis. According to the data provided in the research, commensal bacterial-derived metabolites play an important role in epigenetically regulating type 2 intestinal immune responses through active regulation of tuft cell growth. The studies that are being addressed here have shed light on the significance of this function for metabolites that are generated from commensal bacteria. These cells are to blame for the increased sensitivity in the airways, and they can be discovered elsewhere in the body. It is noteworthy to note that HDAC3 is expressed everywhere, and that the levels of butyrate in extraintestinal areas mirror the bacterial colonization of those regions. Both of these facts are related to the fact that HDAC3 is expressed everywhere. As a consequence of this, it is not inconceivable that butyrate manipulation of HDAC3 may potentially alter immunological responses that are dependent on tuft cells in distant tissue areas. As a consequence of this, it is possible that treating pathologic inflammation throughout mucosal tissues using treatments that include modulating this system using pharmacological agents, methods based on nutrition, or ways based on microbiota might be useful. Using a variety of research approaches and points of view, such as mouse models, human biopsies, organoids, and the interactions of microbiota, this work investigates the linkages between tuft cells and expands our understanding of the influence that microbiota have, which is currently understudied, on type 2 immunology. Positive feedback. I truly appreciate how in-depth the research was, as well as how well-written the paper itself was. In addition to doing research on tuft cells in mouse models, the researchers investigated the formation of human tuft cells in connection to butyrate. They also investigated the microbiome for polymicrobial interactions and biochemistry. The outcomes of the investigation were supported by a wealth of information and high-quality microscopy in the aforementioned study. Employing this helminth was a brilliant choice, in my opinion, given that Nippostrongylus brasiliensis normally colonized rodents as a host organism. I had never heard of using organoids in tuft cell studies before, so I thought it was a really novel approach. It was quite intriguing to see how the findings from mice applied to human organoid samples. Things to Possibly Consider The use of butyrate for therapy is not clearly explained. Is it concentration-dependent? The immune response is not well understood. ILC2 (frequency) is the only measurement available, although it is not a reliable indicator of immunological response. What about the IgE reaction after worm infection? the Th2 cytokines? actual (as opposed to merely their frequency) It would be interesting to look at the immune response's effectiveness under various settings in the mouse model. It's wonderful to see how HDAC3 affects the animals with a deficiency. I do, however, wonder whether there is an additional method, such as using drugs. Perhaps this additional experiment could offer more  that additional evidence that HDAC3 is crucial to the mentioned events. There are inadequate controls in F. prausnitzii recolonization trials. For instance, a control using bacteria that do not produce butyrate as well as bacteria that have been destroyed would be valuable. A better data display is required. Please consider displaying data from individual mice on barcharts. Bar charts are no longer advised for use in scientific articles. Analysis of imaging data and how many tuft cells are detected per 1) unit area, or per 2) nucleated cell, must be done in addition to flow cytometry data. The number of cells in the entire tissue might then be extrapolated using this information. There are no examples of gating strategies for identifying cells (like ILC2s) in the whole study. Without them, it is impossible to determine if the percentages depicted in the numbers are accurate. Additionally, displayed flow cytometry plots (like Fig. 1B) should reflect the percentage of cells in each individual gate. There is insufficient evidence to prove that the Cre mice are true knockouts rather than knockdowns with a phenotypic. What takes place after eggs have been expelled for a period of more than ten days (Fig. 3E)? Is there a relationship between having poor control and having a low IgE response? Low numbers of eosinophils being recruited? It is likely that butyrate has more than one use. What evidence do we have that the key factor impacting HDAC3 expression actually does exist? What additional possibilities are there to consider? What consequences does the absence of HDAC3 in the gut have for macrophages, DCs, and neutrophils that have been recruited in response to an infection? This has to be broken down much more. During the course of a normal illness, does the amount of butyrate in the body change? It would be helpful to illustrate the variation in the datasets using barcharts that contain data points for each individual mouse. There is a possibility that organizing with many figures will be beneficial. For example, Figure 1 depicts three independent tests that are now being conducted. There is some ambiguity about the keys in Figure 2. It's possible that matching color to solid/empty will result in a more accurate translation of the information. Never brought up the L stage, which is important for when the worms were put subcutaneously if you can help it. Could include a life cycle to highlight the movement of the worm as well as the stage at when mice were initially exposed to it. If mice don't cough, how are the worms supposed to get out of the lungs and into the stomach? What was the purpose of the K9 exercise in figure 6? Please explain the reasoning behind your decision. Describe the steps that you take. Why was the promoter looked into only? 16S sequencing is not shown by the numbers, despite the fact that it is specified. Why stop at sequencing the 16S region when we could do the full genome? You should be able to demonstrate that levels of butyrate fluctuate or shift during an infection with helminths.

All from one site or geographically spread out?  Seems to me that without broad sampling across each basin and larger sample sizes that it is difficult to exclude the possibilities that rare alleles present in translocated fish have not been picked up in their source populations (thus they appear to be endemic to other rivers).  For instance, if translocated fish into a new river were sourced from Tinana Creek, and you ran this analysis without having sampled Tinana Creek you would conclude the population in that new river had lots of endemic alleles and represents an original population, not a translocated one simply because you hadn't sampled the source or close to the source population.  It would seem very simple for ""endemic"" alleles to be from the Mary River and simply either been lost today due to species decline, or just not sampled in the current study.  What are the frequency of these ""endemic"" alleles in the Brisbane and Pine rivers?  While the Pine River results are potentially harder to explain, to call the Brisbane results as being evidence for an original population seems rather weak.  Why would lungfish be so rare in the Brisbane originally compared to today when there are 10s of thousands of them present after only a few generations?  Also, your suggestion of not mixing these populations because you assume they are locally adapted is not what many conservation biologists advocate today, where mixing across populations is usually recommended and has shown success, at least in Macquarie Perch.  There is no direct evidence for local adaptation and all of the rivers are from a similar climatic region.  Fish from the Mary River have done fantastically well in the Brisbane River, so clearly any local adaptation to their old habitat has not stopped them from doing really well in their new different habitat.",2023-04-11T08:41:06,peterunmack,Peter Unmack,10.1101/2023.03.24.533984,Unravelling the mystery of endemic versus translocated populations of the endangered Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri),"Roberto Biello, Silvia Ghirotto, Daniel J.

However, I'd like to see you address a couple of technical issues and perhaps one theoretical issue in the final manuscript: - the output you posted shows some unusual results, which are potentially false positives that appear to be concentrated among the shotgun and noUDG samples. I'm guessing that this is due to the same types of ancient DNA damage creating IBD-like patterns in these samples. If so, isn't there a risk that many or even most of the individuals in your analysis are affected by this problem to some degree, which might be skewing your estimates of genealogical relatedness between them? - many individuals from groups that have experienced founder effects, such as Ashkenazi Jews, appear to be close genetic cousins, even though they're not genealogical cousins. Basically, the reason for this is a reduction in haplotype diversity in such populations. Have you considered the possibility that at least some of the close relationships that you're seeing between individuals and populations might be exaggerated by founder effects? - thanks to ancient DNA we've learned that the Yamnaya phenomenon isn't just an archeological horizon but also a closely related and genetically very similar group of people. Indeed, in my mind, ancient DNA has helped to redefine the Yamnaya concept, with Y-chromosome haplogroup R1b-Z2103 now being one of the key traits of the Yamnaya identity. So considering that the Corded Ware people are not rich in R1b-Z2103, and even the earliest Corded Ware individuals are somewhat different from the Yamnaya people in terms of genome-wide genetic structure, it doesn't seem right to keep claiming that the Corded Ware population is derived from Yamnaya. Indeed, I can't see anything in your IBD data that would preclude the idea that the Corded Ware and Yamnaya peoples were different populations derived from the same as yet unsampled pre-Yamnaya/post-Sredny steppe group.",2023-04-08T12:17:32,disqus_Og9I1KoklL,Davidski,10.1101/2023.03.08.531671,ancIBD - Screening for identity by descent segments in human ancient DNA,"Harald Ringbauer, Yilei Huang, Ali Akbari, Swapan Mallick, Nick Patterson, David Reich",2023-03-09

First, LMetalSite is a binding site detection method, which is not designed for binding protein identification. Most methods in this field are only trained on binding proteins. If the authors want to use LMetalSite to distinguish binding vs. non-binding proteins, they should re-design the output scores, just like [PepNN Commun Biol 2022]. However, they did not mention any details about how to convert the residue-level predictions by LMetalSite into protein-level predictions. Second, the datasets of LMetalSite removed redundant sequences sharing identity >25% over 30% alignment coverage, which is a strict and common threshold used in this community. The new datasets in M-Ionic collected sequences with no more than 20% identity, which is similar to LMetalSite. However, M-Ionic used a loose threshold for the alignment coverage (90%). Besides, the negative set collected by the authors only removed redundant sequences sharing 100% identity, which might be another potential problem.",2023-04-08T05:50:30,disqus_nGLtVfQB7S,Qianmu Yuan,10.1101/2023.04.06.535847,M-Ionic: Prediction of metal ion binding sites from sequence using residue embeddings,"Aditi Shenoy, Yogesh Kalakoti, Durai Sundar, Arne Elofsson",2023-04-06

Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) is a widely used animal model for understanding the pathogenesis of its’ human counterpart, Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). To initiate a productive infection the virus must first gain access to a host cell. MCMV has various glycoproteins on its surface that interact with specific host cellular receptors depending on cell type. It was recently shown that Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) is important for MCMV entry into a variety of cell types. Depending on the cell type MCMV utilizes different viral glycoproteins to attach and enter host cells. In fibroblasts, viral entry favors the utilization of viral glycoproteins gB in conjunction with gH/gL/gO known as the trimer. In endothelial, epithelial or myeloid cells, viral entry occurs through the use of gB, the trimer and another complex made up of gH/gL/gO/Mck2 which is known as the pentamer. Mck2 or mouse chemokine 2, has dual functionality in both viral entry and chemokine function. Currently it has not been elucidated the host cellular receptor that Mck2 utilizes for entry into host cells. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 screen, this study identifies the MHC-I molecule is implicated in MCK2 dependent entry into macrophages. Positive feedback. I felt that the way the paper is organized was logical and easy to follow. The color coding of the different viruses helped to follow along in the graphs. In the in vivo experiments, utilizing both plaque assays and fluorescence levels to confirm results made them more convincing. The restoration of the phenotype by complementation of B2m and CD81 made the results more convincing. Utilizing the two different viruses that either have or lack MCK2 definitely strengthens their argument.  In examining the B2m relationship with Mck2, performing the experiments both in primary cells and immortalized cells strengthens the argument. Using different virus strains that have different genetic manipulations of MCK2, is beneficial for showing that the phenotype is due to a defective protein and not just that specific mutation of the protein in that virus strain. Major Concerns Given that most of the initial experiments are done in cell culture, I would have expected there to be more replicates. Also why there are different numbers of replicates used between the different virus groups? Characterizing stromal cells as anything not Cd11c positive is a reach. The lack of substantial infectivity of these viruses, regardless of the presence of MCK2, in most of these cell lines makes the data hard to believe I wonder if the current in vivo data can truly tell if lack of H-2 molecules impacts dissemination. Alternatively, it could impact the rate of virus growth in the SG or in other tissues. To truly understand whether dissemination is impacted one must use barcoded viruses. Minor concerns While infectivity using these reporter viruses has been assessed by flow cytometry previously, I think that performing a plaque assay would further validate results. List the actual p values instead of using the star annotation Minor spelling errors (pg. 25 the strain C57BL/6 is spelled incorrectly) For Figure 4 C-E, it would be helpful to make the scales on each of the graphs the same to be able to compare between all three graphs. For Figure 5D, it would be beneficial to show the isotype control in the same panel as the MHC-1 to confirm increase/decrease of expression For those not in the field, I felt that there was not enough emphasis on what type of cellular entry MCK2 functions in, which would help the reader get a more complete understanding of the results. For figure 7, it would be more convincing that the viruses lacking MCK2 are in stromal cells if there was a specific marker used for stromal cells For figure 3C, it is a little unclear what the middle column is demonstrating if it is either a locus or reference sequence. This could be easily clarified in the figure legend or materials/methods section. In page 5 of the results, when talking about the defective MCK2 and how it was repaired, it would be helpful to make it more clear to the reader for how it was defective and how it was repaired. Why was the viral load in SG measured at day 7? What if a later time point (e.g., day 14) viral load is the same for two types of the viruses? This needs to be checked. Which specific H-2 molecules (L,D,K) are important for infection? This could be an interesting point of discussion. b2M-deficient mice may have weird NK cell response that could play a role in control of MCMV. Can the authors confirm that NK cells were not involved in viral control in these mice? In experiments even with MOI=1 infection rate is very low, <20%. Why? Would waiting for longer time to detect infected cells allow detecting all cells as infected?",2023-04-05T15:39:35,,UTK Micro Immunology JC,10.1101/2022.10.05.510922,MHC class Ia molecules facilitate MCK2-dependent MCMV infection of macrophages and virus dissemination to the salivary gland,"Berislav Bošnjak, Elisa Henze, Yvonne Lueder, Kim Thi Hoang Do, Alaleh Rezalofti, Christiane Ritter, Anja Schimrock, Stefanie Willenzon, Hristo Georgiev, Lea Fritz, Melanie Galla, Karen Wagner, Martin Messerle, Reinhold Förster",2022-10-07

Though much focus is centered on thin-film freezing and nanotechnology, why has metabolism of niclosamide by cytochrome P450  CYP1A2 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A1 drawn so little attention? Is it possible after the gut metabolizes niclosamide, what little remains fortuitously interacts with the tape worm but is rendered barely absorbable systemically?  Consider what might be gained if this drug’s p.o. administration was preceded by - or combined - with known CYP/UGT inhibitors such as fluvoxamine, cimetidine, melatonin, ciprofloxacin, acetacin and kaempferol.  Could a more therapeutic blood level be attained? Approaching this dilemma from a different direction, might niclosamide be delivered via suppository, with an increase in its bioavailability?  Many drugs with similar insolubility and molecular weight are already administered rectally with resulting serum levels as effective as pills or capsules.
