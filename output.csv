We found the discovery of this novel splicing mechanism quite interesting, which seems like a last-resort strategy for cells to remove transposons that have already integrated into exons while still retaining some level of functional protein. The mutagenesis experiment to identify SOS splicing factors was particularly interesting. One question that came up in our discussion: What happens to the excised transposon post-SOS splicing? Is there any evidence that it gets degraded or reintegrated elsewhere in the genome?",2025-03-14T21:15:12,disqus_OwdaaMCN6M,Rajendra K C,,,,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.05.511006v1#comment-6670189789,biorxivstage,4,"Note to add to this preprint (Zheng et al., 2022). Since the publication of this genetically encoded sensor-based image analysis program (or GESIAP2.0) on bioRxiv in 2022 (Zheng et al., 2022), we have received extensive feedback from collaborators, colleagues, and reviewers—some of whom commented and reviewed our manuscripts that utilized GESIAP to analyze synaptic properties (Huang et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025b).  This feedback has been instrumental in identifying several limitations associated with GESIAP2.0.  Fortunately, these issues have been resolved in the latest version, GESIAP3.0, which incorporates algorithms independently developed by Roger Zhu and colleagues at Zhejiang University (Zhu et al., 2024). One limitation of GESIAP2.0 concerns the initial movement correction procedure. GESIAP2.0 employs translational (or affine) alignment algorithms to correct movements in fluorescence signals collected from ex vivo imaging experiments (Zheng et al., 2022).  While effective for minor displacements, this method struggles with larger movements, leading to the exclusion of many cells from analysis.  GESIAP3.0 incorporates an advanced non-rigid movement correction algorithm that corrects complex displacements in behaving animals, as well as small movements in ex vivo experiments (Zhu et al., 2024).  Recent tests show that this algorithm eliminates the need for alignment, improving the robustness and accuracy of the image analysis. Both GESAIP2.0 (Zheng et al., 2022) and GESAIP3.0 (Zhu et al., 2024) utilize the Landweber deconvolution procedure (Sage et al., 2017), a published method that enhances microscopic image quality by ""reassigning"" detected photons to their original emitting locations in both ex vivo and in vivo experiments. Another notable limitation of GESIAP2.0 is the denoising procedure.  Initially, GESIAP2.0 used a non-synaptic function to fit fluorescence responses (Zheng et al., 2022). This method proved ineffective in accurately identifying key parameters of fluorescence responses, including latency and peak.  This method often failed to detect small fluorescence responses from noise background, resulting in an underestimation of releasing synapses (Zheng et al., 2022).  Roger Zhu later introduced a double-exponential synaptic function to improve fitting, but its high computational demands prevented its application to all data in the preprint (Zheng et al., 2022).  In GESIAP3.0, Roger Zhu and his Zhejiang University team implemented a least-squares non-linear optimization using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to fit double-exponential synaptic function (Zhu et al., 2024).  This  method combines gradient descent with the Gauss-Newton method (Moré, 2006; Gavin, 2019), fitting both the rise and decay phases of synaptic responses to optimize parameter regression.  Biological constraints based on the response properties of genetically encoded sensors (e.g., (Borden et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2021)) were also incorporated to restrict parameter ranges, improving both speed and accuracy. The final step in GESIAP2.0 is flawed (Zheng et al., 2022).  To amplify small signals extracted during denoising, baseline responses are arbitrarily subtracted, introducing random variations in the fluorescence responses.  In contrast, GESIAP3.0 improves small signal extraction using double-exponential synaptic function fitting (Zhu et al., 2024).  When necessary, it further reduces residual noise with a bilateral non-linear filter (Tomasi and Manduchi, 1998), enhancing image clarity without inflating fluorescence ΔF/F0 values. In summary, GESIAP2.0 (Zheng et al., 2022) provides further proof-of-principle that nanoscopic sensor-based functional imaging analysis can dissect synaptic properties of transmission across various transmitters, cell types, and animal species (cf. (Zhu et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021)).  This analysis also implies both shared patterns and a diverse range of presynaptic release dynamics that contribute to neuromodulation.  However, code defects in GESIAP2.0 lead to inaccurate estimates of synaptic properties, limiting its ability to address fundamental biological questions.  Our new manuscripts show that synaptic properties calculated using GESIAP3.0 (Huang et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025b) differ significantly from those obtained with GESIAP2.0 and align closely with results from independent approaches.  Hence, we encourage readers to contact the Zhejiang University team for potential collaborations and access to the GESIAP3.0 code. - J.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.09.566486v1#comment-6669300561,biorxivstage,0,"There are two key conclusions in this paper: 1) an ancestral origin of house mice from the Indo-Pakistan region and 2) incomplete lineage sorting for the observed alle sharing between contemporary populations. Both conclusions are not sufficiently supported, given the current published evidence. I suggest that the authors carefully study this previous evidence and adjust their conclusions accordingly. 1. Origin of the house mouse radiation To trace the region of origin based on population genetic data, requires sufficient sampling of the relevant regions and comparable sample structures. The broadest samplings available to date that address the question of the origin are published in (Afzali, 2024; Hardouin et al., 2015). They show a high diversity of lineages in Iran and a complex history of populations across Asia. Lawal and Dumont include only one population from Iran, but do not capture the full diversity that is already known from there. Further, some of the population samples used by Lawal and Dumont represent sampling from local regions, while others are from broad regions (PAK and IND). Given the known deme structure in mice (Linnenbrink, Teschke, Montero, Vallier, & Tautz, 2018), the broad samplings of PAK and IND may cover different lineages that should not be lumped into a single one. This issue would need a deeper attention in the overall analysis. 2. Incomplete lineage sorting instead of introgression This issue has been addressed in a large number of papers. All of these authors have carefully evaluated the two alternatives. The analysis presented by Lawal and Dumont is too superficial to make a strong claim that runs contrary to all of these previous data and analysis. Probably the strongest argument against incomplete lineage sorting is the existence of large introgressed haplotypes that segregate in the different subspecies and species and that were found to be subject to adaptive introgression (Song et al., 2011; Staubach et al., 2012). Several of such regions have subsequently been studied in detail and the long haplotype structures were confirmed, e.g. in (Banker, Bonhomme, & Nachman, 2022; Hasenkamp, Solomon, & Tautz, 2015; Linnenbrink, Ullrich, McConnell, & Tautz, 2020). Neither incomplete lineage sorting, nor long-term balancing selection can explain the existence of such long introgressed haplotypes, since they would be broken up by recombination over time. Note that although the mouse lineage divergence times seem ""shallow"" with being shorter than 0.5 Million years, the number of generations is actually high, given the short generation times. To suggest that incomplete lineage sorting is a possible explanation for the shared alleles would require to show with appropriate simulations that long haplotypes could be retained over hundreds of thousands of generations without breaking them up. Such simulations have been extensively used for the comparisons between Neandertals and humans, where introgression at specific loci is distinguished from ILS by comparing expected haplotype lengths.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.25.614899v1#comment-6667136200,biorxivstage,0,"Dear Authors, Thank you for sharing your insightful work, ""In Silico Engineering of Stable siRNA Lipid Nanoparticles: Exploring the Impact of Ionizable Lipid Concentrations for Enhanced Formulation Stability."" Your study makes an important contribution to the field of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) research by highlighting the role of ionizable lipid concentrations in siRNA encapsulation and stability. The use of coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of LNP formation, which is particularly valuable for optimizing RNA-based drug delivery systems. Summary This study examines how neutral and positive ionizable lipids influence LNP stability and siRNA encapsulation efficiency. The findings indicate that LNPs with positive ionizable lipids encapsulate siRNA more effectively than those with neutral lipids, likely due to their integration with phospholipids and the prevention of siRNA escape. Interestingly, low and medium concentrations of both neutral and positive DLKC2 showed better compartment formation and encapsulation efficiency compared to high concentrations. Additionally, neutral lipids exhibited greater aggregation, which could impact LNP stability. Introduction Your introduction effectively establishes the relevance of this study by situating it within the broader context of LNP research. The discussion of existing challenges in siRNA delivery and the role of lipid composition is well-articulated. However, further elaboration on how your study builds upon previous experimental findings could help connect computational insights with practical applications. Results The figures and data presentation generally support your conclusions. Figure 4, which illustrates LNP compartment formation at different lipid concentrations, is particularly valuable in showing how high concentrations lead to instability. We do think that some quantitative metrics such as bilayer thickness, lipid density, or compartment size would enhance the strength of these findings. Additionally, since water is omitted from the visualizations for clarity, we think it would be beneficial to include a figure that shows water so we can visualize the hydration effects and lipid-water interactions. Discussion Your discussion effectively compares findings with prior studies, reinforcing that positive ionizable lipids enhance siRNA encapsulation and that lipid aggregation in neutral systems may reduce stability. While you mention previous molecular dynamics studies (e.g., Paloncýová et al. and Trollmann & Böckmann), we feel a more direct comparison of numerical data and trends from these works would further contextualize your results. Additionally, discussing potential experimental validation techniques (e.g., cryogenic electron microscopy or encapsulation efficiency assays) could provide future directions for integrating simulations with laboratory-based studies. However, that is just our opinion as we do understand that this study takes on a more computational approach and is still very impactful. Suggestions for Improvement 1.	Expand quantitative analysis in Figure 4 by including measurements of bilayer thickness, lipid density, and compartment size to provide a more rigorous validation of LNP stability. 2.	Clarify the role of hydration in lipid-water interactions since water was omitted in visualizations. 3.	Strengthen comparisons with previous molecular dynamics and experimental studies by integrating direct numerical contrasts. 4.	Discuss potential experimental validation approaches that could complement your computational findings and enhance their real-world applicability. Final Thoughts Overall, this paper presents a well-structured and valuable contribution to siRNA delivery research. With minor refinements in quantitative analysis, literature comparisons, and discussion of experimental validation, the study could be even more impactful.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.23.461553v1#comment-6667135234,biorxivstage,0,"Summary: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of miRNA profiles in Culex tarsalis, identifying 86 known miRNAs and 20 novel miRNAs, is a significant contribution to the field of insect molecular biology and vector research. This works sets the foundation for future studies on gene regulation and host-pathogen interactions in Cx. tarsalis, a major vector of West Nile Virus (WNV). While the methodology is robust and the findings are compelling, the paper would benefit from some minor revisions to strengthen data presentation, clarify experimental choices, and align its conclusions more closely with the results. Introduction: The introduction frames the importance of miRNA research in Cx. tarsalis well, particularly in the context of understanding its role as a vector for WNV. However, the title of the paper may be misleading since the findings do not directly link the identified miRNAs to WNV vectoring. Reframing the title and introduction to focus on the broader importance of miRNA characterization in Cx. tarsal without overemphasizing the WNV connection would improve clarity and prevent misalignment between the study’s scope and its claims. Results: The results section presents a comprehensive dataset of miRNAs identified through computational comparison with other mosquito species and validated using RT-qPCR. The discovery of novel miRNAs and the observed isomiR variations are particularly noteworthy, with the predominance of 3’ end insertions being a finding of potential significance in gene regulation. That said, clearer justification for the selection of the 10 miRNAs validated by qPCR would strengthen the interpretability of the results. Discussion: The discussion effectively places the study’s findings within the broader context of existing research on mosquito miRNAs and draws meaningful comparisons with other species like Aedes albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The evolutionary conservation of miR-184 and the identification of unique miRNAs in Cx. tarsalis offer valuable insights. However, the paper would benefit from further discussion on the functional implications of these miRNAs, particularly their potential roles in development, immunity, and host-pathogen interactions. Additionally, the observed differences in miRNA expression between cell lines and whole organisms raise important questions that warrant more exploration. Suggestions: 1.	Revise the title to better reflect the study’s current findings and avoid overemphasizing WNV. 2.	Clarify the rationale behind the selection of the 10 miRNAs for qPCR validation. 3.	Expand the discussion on the functional roles of the identified miRNAs and their potential involvement in host-pathogen interactions. 4.	Address the limitations more explicitly, such as the reliance on a single genome assembly, the lack of data from different mosquito life stages and tissues, and the absence of additional validation methods like Northern blot. 5.	Consider including a statistical analysis to highlight differences in miRNA expression between cell lines and whole organisms. 6.	Discuss the potential influence of feeding behavior on gene expression and its relevance to vector competence.",2025-03-10T04:17:10,disqus_zNEHHjaT83,Young Cho,,,,

It's not Biosyn Corporation ( http://biosyncorp.com), as you wrote, but rather Bio-Synthesis ( http://biosyn.com). Moreover, in the TSO sequence: ""/5Biosg/"" is the acronym used by IDT for a 5' biotin. The ""g"" has nothing to do with deoxyguanosine (G), but you write in the paper ""5BiosG/"" and this can be confusing. The standard 10x TSO sequence is, in fact: 5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACATrGrGrG-3’ so no G at the 5' (like there was never a G at the 5' of the SMART-seq oligo, from which 10x took their sequence).

I would perhaps perform the experiments with two additional setups: a) MHC-blockage (If MAIT cells are really specific they should appear here) b) MR1-blockage (if MAIT cells are specific and activated via TCR they should not  appear here) 2) Have you tried to perform the analyses separately for HLA-DRB1*15:01 positive and negative individuals separately? It was shown by a study from Adaptive Biotechnology that a limited number of TCR clusters enriched in MS exist and that these clusters are mostly CD4 and very different in DRB1*15:01 positive and negative individuals.,2025-03-03T14:46:23,elisarosati,Elisa Rosati,,,,

Use of mock scanner/pre-scan prep: While it’s an important factor to consider, the majority of the sessions in this dataset did not use any pre-scan accommodation. The exception here is the toddlers that were scanned by the Saxe Lab at MIT. Anecdotally, this was quite helpful at these older ages.

In my view it would be helpful if you further develop the descriptions of the state of trabeculation. For example, did you make measurements (counting, thicknesses, proportions) of the trabecular and compact layer, what were the values and how do they relate to diagnostic criteria associated with trabeculation? It would also be helpful if you support this part of your Results with clinical imaging (echocardiography and CMR) onto which is shown the measurements (or overt phenotype) that led to the interpretation of 'hypertrabeculation'. I for one would not mind a full text figure dedicated to this part. Part of the reason for giving these suggestions is of course that your title states 'hypertrabeculation' while the associated phenotyping is proportionally very small and accordingly a bit unclear.

Summary This paper explores the capabilities of twin prime editing (twinPE) for large DNA sequence modifications, including deletions, replacements, integrations, and inversions. The authors demonstrate the efficiency of twinPE in human cells (HEK293T & Huh7) and its potential for therapeutic applications when combined with the Bxb1 integrase. Key findings include precise and flexible editing with fewer indels, high knock-in efficiency, and the ability to bypass certain DNA repair pathways. However, the study lacks long-term data on genomic stability and scalability for human applications, and some experimental details and comparisons with other gene-editing techniques are insufficiently explored. Introduction The introduction provides a solid foundation for the study but could benefit from more background information on the therapeutic applications explored, as well as the mechanism that resulted in limitations relating to the pegRNA pairs, or the low Bxb1 efficiency. Results Figure 2: The figure demonstrates twinPE’s efficiency in large DNA sequence insertion and replacement. However, the formatting is poor, the figure legend is separate from the figure and labels are a bit confusing. The authors should revise the figure to improve readability. The large error bar in Fig. 2F (deletion size 589) suggests variability in the editing strategy. The authors should address this in the text, discussing potential outliers or variability in the system. Figure 3: This figure effectively shows the mechanism and efficiency of twinPE combined with Bxb1 integrase. However, the authors should clarify why certain pegRNA pairs performed better than others and why some loci (e.g., CCR5, AAVS1) were more successful. The discussion should also address the limitations of single transfection compared to sequential transfection to allow researchers to build off of this work. Figure 4: The figure explores therapeutic applications of twinPE, particularly in correcting inversions at recombination hotspots. The authors should expand on the implications of these findings for gene therapy and discuss potential challenges in scaling up for human applications. Discussion The discussion is well-written but could be strengthened by addressing the following: Limitations of twinPE: The authors should discuss why lower frequencies occurred in single transfection compared to sequential transfection and why some pegRNA pairs performed better than others. Additionally, they should explore the potential limitations of using Bxb1 integrase and whether other integrases could be more effective. Comparison with other gene-editing techniques: The authors briefly mention the advantages of twinPE over CRISPR but do not provide a direct comparison. Including experimental data or a discussion comparing twinPE to CRISPR or other editing methods would strengthen the paper. Long-term implications: The study lacks long-term data on genomic stability after large DNA modifications. The authors should discuss potential risks, such as off-target effects or genomic instability, and suggest future studies to address these concerns. Suggestions Improve Figure Quality: Revise figures to ensure they are clear, readable, and properly formatted. Include detailed legends and consider adding summary panels to highlight key findings. Expand on Limitations: Discuss the limitations of twinPE in more detail, including variability in editing efficiency, challenges in scaling up for human applications, and potential long-term effects on genomic stability. Compare with Other Techniques: Include a direct comparison of twinPE with CRISPR or other gene-editing methods to highlight its advantages and disadvantages. Explore Additional Integrases: Investigate the use of other integrases in combination with twinPE to determine if they offer improved efficiency or precision. Provide Long-Term Data: Conduct follow-up studies to assess the long-term effects of large DNA modifications on genomic stability and cell viability. Enhance the Introduction: Add more background information on the limitations of existing gene-editing technologies and how twinPE addresses these challenges. Address Variability in Results: Discuss potential outliers or variability in the data, particularly in Fig. 2F, and suggest ways to improve consistency in future experiments. Editorial Decision The paper presents significant advancements in gene-editing technology and demonstrates the potential of twinPE for precise and efficient large DNA sequence modifications. However, the study would benefit from addressing the limitations and expanding on the comparisons with other gene-editing techniques. This publication could be strengthened with revisions to improve figure quality, clarify data interpretation, and exploring long-term stability the genetic edits. Overall, the paper was dense with information so the limitations are understandable, as only so much can be presented in one publication.",2025-02-26T10:03:48,disqus_zNEHHjaT83,Young Cho,,,,

Doing it in the way of this paper won't even guarantee your CNV boundaries are matched correctly with the junction breakends! Let alone consistent junction copy numbers or realistic complex SV events. This approach of treating each ""variant"" as an individual event only works for short variants, and CNVs to some extent. To truly forward simulate a cancer genome that is accumulating structural variants/CNVs requires virtual cell cycles and keeping tabs on the junction balance constraints and linear/circular DNA structures, e.g., losing a telomere, di-centric chromsomes. We tried this before, but it is very very hard as the genomes coming out of the simulations are not anything remotely survivable for a cell and nothing like the real cancer genomes.

Sajadi et al. provide valuable insights into the temporal signaling dynamics of diuretic and anti-diuretic hormones, significantly enhancing our understanding of excretory physiology in mosquitoes. The authors employ heterologous expression of receptors to quantify circulating peptide levels, a robust methodological approach that strengthens receptor-ligand interaction validation and hormone quantification. Notably, the study demonstrates a synergistic interaction between DH31 and kinin-like peptides on Malpighian tubules, contributing novel findings to the existing literature on neuropeptide-mediated excretory regulation in mosquitoes. Overall, the study presents an innovative and well-executed investigation with high methodological rigor. The authors have presented their findings in a clear and well-structured manner. We only have a few questions and comments/suggestions that could help improve the clarity of the manuscript: 1.     Can the authors clarify the exact number of female mosquitoes used in each condition (blood-fed vs. non-blood-fed) at each time point, specifically in methodology section 3.2 for the haemolymph collection? 2.     Were there any biological replicates across different mosquito cohorts? Did the authors observe variability between different mosquito batches? Sample sizes have been provided in the figure captions but what does n signify? 3.     The study utilizes specific time points for haemolymph collection post-blood feeding. Can the authors provide justification for selecting these intervals? Were preliminary studies conducted to determine these as the most informative time-points, or were they based on prior literature? 4.     The authors acknowledge the roles of serotonin (5HT) and DH44 in regulating fluid secretion but focus their experimental analysis on DH31, kinin, and CAPA peptides. Could they clarify why 5HT and DH44 were not included in their haemolymph quantification assays? Were there methodological limitations, or were these hormones not expected to show significant post-bloodmeal changes, or is this something they plan to address in the future? 5.     The study quantifies neuropeptide levels over time but does not discuss the mechanisms responsible for their clearance from haemolymph. Can the authors speculate on whether DH31, kinin, and CAPA peptides are degraded enzymatically, removed through receptor-mediated internalization, or cleared by the Malpighian tubules? Can they use in silico approaches to predict the half-life of these peptides based on their sequence composition? Alternatively, can they extract hemolymph when the peptide has peak activity and test this extract after different times to see how much bioactivity they retain over time? Addressing this would enhance our understanding of neuropeptide turnover and regulation. 6.     Including the individual data points in the bar graphs can provide more information on the spread of the data.

However, we believe the commenter is unfamiliar with recent literature on this topic and may not have fully understood the main aim of our study. The suggestion to “ stop assuming overly simplistic and reductionist conclusions ” does not resonate with our current and past results for the following reasons: 1) We selected the number of components using parallel analysis, a widely accepted data-driven method that compares observed eigenvalues with those generated from random data. This approach outperforms arbitrary variance thresholds used in some fields, as well as other selection methods (Zwick & Velicer, 1986; Velicer et al., 2000; Hayton et al., 2004). Several alternative methods exist, but parallel analysis has been shown to provide a statistically robust basis for component selection across disciplines. 2) As described in our manuscript, we extracted and analyzed two components for all muscles. Together, these components accounted for 85% of the variance in TA, 85% in FDI, 69% in VL, and 65% in VM-VL, values that align with prior studies (see, for example, Negro et al. 2009, Del Vecchio et al. 2023, Rossato et al. 2024). All these previous studies have used a number of components that together accounted for less than 90% of the variance. 3) Our results show that the first of the two extracted components (which accounts for a considerable portion of variance of smoothed discharge rates) is more strongly correlated with force oscillations than the second component, a finding that was robust across different muscles and both linear methods employed. Additionally, we demonstrated that the second component was not consistent across trials with the same force output, questioning its role in the control of force generation. Finally, our non-linear network-information framework corroborated the presence of a single dominant component, reinforcing our findings through an independent approach. Therefore, we strongly encourage the anonymous commenter a more focused read of our manuscript and we welcome any further constructive discussions and feedback that help improve our work.",2025-02-18T17:48:27,helio_cabral,Helio Cabral,,,,

The paper states: Overall, the CosMx 6K segmentation tool produced cells with larger sizes, higher solidity, and better circularity, indicative of more regular and convex cell shapes compared to other platforms I would argue ""larger"", ""more circular"", and ""convex"" do not necessarily mean better segmentation. For example, ""more circular"" and ""convex"" could be  the bias of the particular segmentation model. If more circular is better, then ""nucleus segmentation + large expansion"" (basically the first version of Xenium segmentation prior to multi modal cell segmentation stain) is the better segmentation since it's large, circular, and convex. The paper later states: Among the ST platforms, Xenium 5K showed better separation of marker gene pairs after segmentation We further visualized marker gene expression across the annotated cell types. Xenium 5K exhibited the most distinct expression patterns (Supplementary Fig. 8d), facilitating more accurate cell type annotations. and concludes: Despite exhibiting more irregular segmentation shapes, Xenium 5K effectively distinguished different cell types and minimized transcript mixing between adjacent cells ""Better separation of marker gene pairs"", ""distinguish different cell types"" and ""minimize transcript mixing"" are indeed the more principled and biologically meaningful metrics to evaluate cell segmentation. The word ""despite"" in the conclusion suggests circularity means better segmentation, which I don't necessarily agree.",2025-02-18T17:40:04,dongyaoli,Dongyao Li,,,,

The below review is the result of this exercise and reflects thoughts and comments of several people. We hope this helps you with your way forward to publish the paper in a good journal. Summary The manuscript by Cresto et al. addresses an important question concerning the contribution of astrocytic defects in oligophrenin‐1 (Ophn1) deficiency in intellectual disability. Ophn1 is highly present at synapses and regulates the RhoA/ROCK/MLC2 pathway through its RhoGAP domain, having an important role in cytoskeleton remodelling. Previous work from the authors of this manuscript reported that constitutive Ophn1 knockout mice show deficits in synaptic transmission and plasticity, due to pre-synaptic dysfunction. Moreover, Ophn1 deficient astrocytes from those mice also display altered morphology resulting from hyperactivation of the RhoA/ROCK/MLC2 pathway. This study examines the impact of astroglial Ophn1 deficiency on synaptic transmission, plasticity, and spatial memory using a conditional, localized, and AAV-inducible approach. The researchers selectively disrupt Ophn1 in adult hippocampal astrocytes and assess astrocyte morphology, synaptic coverage, and explore two key molecular mechanisms: adenosine A1 receptor signaling and the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. A strength of this study is the comparison between the conditional knockdown and the constitutive KO model, which helps to confirm that some of the observed effects are specifically due to the presence of the protein in astrocytes. However, a potential weakness is that in some cases, the targeting may not have been sufficient to fully isolate the astroglial pathway, leaving room for contributions from other cell types or compensatory mechanisms. Another strength of this study is the comprehensive approach taken to investigate the effects of oligophrenin deficiency in astrocytes, encompassing behavioral experiments, electrophysiology, cellular morphology, and molecular pathways. However, the molecular pathway analysis remains incomplete, leaving some mechanistic aspects unresolved. One limitation of this study is the exclusive use of adult mice and mature astrocytes to investigate a neurodevelopmental disorder, which may not fully capture the relevant developmental mechanisms. Additionally, all experiments were conducted in murine astrocytes, with no validation in human cell lines, raising questions about the translatability of the findings. Major Comments 1.	KDastro and KDneuro verification would benefit from additional protein-level quantifications in a Western Blot or immunostaining, e.g. by using directly an anti-oligophrenin antibody or an anti-FLAG-tag antibody. 2.	The measurements of alternations in the Y maze test could be described in more detail. This specific test relies on the difference between entries into consecutive different arms (i.e. ABC) and into the same arm (i.e. ABB). In the methods section, it is not completely clear if the authors discriminate between these two parameters and how they defined the ""ABB"" alternation. Authors could also introduce the different percentages (consecutive vs. same) into the graph to give a clearer picture of the phenotype. 3.	In addition, the statement that spatial working memory is abolished results a little extreme from only these experiments. It could be defined as impaired or reduced. 4.	Authors claim a reduction in presynaptic release probability, yet the first peak in Fig. 1d is similar for both WT and KDastro. The authors should clarify in the text what they mean by this statement, and how they interpret it from the data. If they mean to imply that there are more presynaptic vesicles, which are released at a lower probability, it would be good to quantify presynaptic vesicle numbers, for instance using EM. 5.	Authors conclude that KDastro neurons show an increase in the activation of adenosine A1 receptors yet they don't validate this phenotype. In Fig.2, it is not clear if the effect of 8-CPT is rescuing the phenotype in KDastro neurons or simply acting on receptor activation as for WT neurons. In the full Ophn1 KO model, neurons are lacking Ophn1, unlike KDastro neurons which still express the protein. Can the authors investigate deeper on the activation of the A1 receptors in KDastro? They could assess cAMP levels via cAMP sensors (i.e. FRET-based cAMP sensors) and PKA activation by immunoblotting for its phosphorylated substrates. In addition, they could also measure adenosine release from Ophn1-KD astrocytes. This could help to define the molecular mechanism supporting the electrophysiological observations. 6.	ROCK inhibitor treatment in the slices is only 20 min. Is this timeframe sufficient to induce morphological changes in the astrocytes? It would be more convincing if a corresponding actin staining was provided. 7.	When ROCK is inhibited, it affects both neurons and astrocytes. Can authors discriminate that the observed neuronal effects are specifically due to ROCK inhibition in astrocytes, rather than direct effects on neurons? This is particularly relevant since ROCK inhibition is expected to mimic the presence of Ophn1, potentially rescuing the astrocytic Ophn1 deficiency. 8.	For both inhibitors (8CPT and Y27632) they don’t validate that in fact inhibition works effectively and that they only target their protein of interest. They could validate this by immunoblotting downstream targets of the adenosine A1 receptor and ROCK, but also potential other off-targets that could be inhibited, like PKC in the case of Y27632. 9.	“Increased branching complexity” only occurs at one specific distance of 25 microns  (Fig 3.d). Generalization of this one measurement seems an overstatement. 10.	Assessment of true morphology of tripartite synapses in Ophn1 KDastro can be further investigated with electron microscopy. This can help to better evaluate changes in plasma membrane and cell boundary morphology on synapses. 11.	Paper would greatly benefit from an illustration of a suggested molecular mechanism. Minor Comments 1.	What is “CD8” for on figure 1b.? 2.	It is not clear what “py” stands for in Fig. 1 d and f. 3.	In figure 1e and 1g it is unclear how the quantification was done. 4.	Figure 3, 4 and 5a-d lack information on the # of mice that were assessed, only the # of astrocytes is reported. 5.	Red and dark red colouring in Fig. 5 are very hard to discern. Authors should consider other colour schemes. 6.	Manuscript would benefit from describing 8CPT and Y27632 functions in the results section. 7.	WT control is missing in Fig. 5e.",2025-02-18T16:22:01,,Anonymous,,,,
