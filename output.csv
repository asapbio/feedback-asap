By comparing healthy controls and cerebellar ataxia patients in a visual tracking task with perturbations, the authors observed that both control pathways are preserved in patients, but that delays are higher for patients in both feedforward and feedback control loops. Additionally, patients exhibited a reduced feedback gain, which the authors interpret as a compensation strategy applied by patients to respond to the temporal incoordination between feedforward and feedback pathways rather than a consequence of the cerebellar damage itself. Finally, the authors demonstrate that the intact feedforward control mechanism can be leveraged in patients to improve tracking performance by presenting a 500ms preview of the future target trajectory. Although patients overall exhibited smaller performance improvements in the preview condition compared to controls, the authors suggest that the significant improvements seen in patients demonstrate that visual preview may serve as a direction for future therapeutic approaches to alleviate motor coordination problems in cerebellar ataxia patients. #Major comments: - Page 4/Figure 2C: At the bottom of page 4 you cite that the mean (or is it the median?) feedforward time delay was 245ms in the patient group. This does not line up with the mean shown by the two error bars in figure 2C. Could you please check if this is a typo or if not mention which moments are described in the text and the figure (mean/median)? The same question applies to the value 144ms (patients) cited for the feedback pathway on page 6. - Page 10 (Section ‚ÄúTarget preview improves ‚Ä¶‚Äù): As shown in figure 5E you mention that there was no significant relationship between ataxia score and error reduction. Based on this non-significant result you suggest that path preview leads to performance improvements independent of ataxia severity. However, have you considered if the absence of significance here might be because of the relatively small sample size of 17 patients? You could consider performing a Bayesian analysis to provide evidence for the absence of an effect? Or maybe have you tried performing a median split of the patient data and compare the means for patients with a high vs. low score? I am asking because figure 5E gives the impression that there is at least a linear trend between error reduction and ataxia score. - Page 12 (end of paragraph): how did you conclude that the improvements in smoothness and phase lead where stronger for the control group compared to the patient group? Did you perform a quantitative analysis of the data presented in figure 6D? - Page 18, Table 1: please provide a more detailed description of the different diagnoses of your patient group. Do you have any information about the approximate onset of symptoms (age at onset) in these patients? - Page 21 & Figure 10: You mention that you compared ‚Äúvarious‚Äù model candidates for the transfer functions of the feedback and feedforward pathways but in figure 10 you only mention the top two candidates for each pathway. Could you provide more details about the different models that were compared and how you selected which possible transfer functions could describe the feedforward and the feedback controller? - Page 24/section 5.6: Could you please provide more details about your statistical analyses. For example, did you test if the assumptions for ANOVA and t-test were satisfied? Which correction method did you apply to compute the degrees of freedom for your unpaired t-tests (DoF are decimal numbers here)? Could you provide F-values, p-values, and effect size measures for all the ANOVA results (for some analyses you only mention p-values)? #Minor comments: - Figure 1D: how does the phase in the lower panel relate to average in figure 2B? Specifically, the range of phase shifts are very different in these two figures and I don‚Äôt understand why from the text. Why is there a phase lead shown in figure 1D, while there is a phase lag in figure 2B? Why does the gain increase in figure 1D and decrease in figure 2B? Please explain Figure 1C/D better in the text. - Page 4, 7th line from the bottom: You refer to figure 2B but it should be 2C - Figure 5 B/C: x-labels are missing - Figure 6A/B: For clarity maybe rename the y-axis labels to gain ratio and phase ratio? - Figure 8: Could you please specify somewhere in your methods what the total duration of one trial was? This was not clear to me from the various figures in the method and result sections. - Page 21/22 (section 5.4) and page 29 (section 6.1): Could you please improve the consistency in your notation of the transfer functions? Specifically, in the method section you use jœâ to denote the Fourier transform but in figure 10A you use s. Further, you use sometimes k, sometimes a, and sometimes b to refer to the gain and the pole of the filters. - This might be field/journal specific, but I would find it easier to follow as a reader if the statistical results would be added to the main text of the results instead of the figure legends",2025-04-28T09:52:40,disqus_giWenCsTY7,Anne Hoffmann,10.1101/2025.02.09.637327,Feedback and feedforward control are differentially delayed in cerebellar ataxia,"Di Cao, Michael G.T.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.13.642867v1#comment-6694175178,biorxivstage,1,"The manuscript by Peterman et al. investigates the role of microtubule dynamics in Langerhans cell morphology, phagocytosis, and directed migration in the epidermis. Through live imaging in zebrafish explants, the study shows that microtubules originating from a perinuclear microtubule organizing center (MTOC) guide the extension of dendrites for effective debris engulfment and enable precise migration toward tissue damage. When microtubules are disrupted, Langerhans cells become less efficient at phagocytosis and lose directional control during migration. These defects are linked to altered actin cytoskeleton polarity through the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway. The findings highlight how microtubule-dependent cell polarity enables immune cells to respond effectively within complex epithelial microenvironments. We found this study to be well-written and containing high-quality data that advances the fields of microtubule and immune cell biology. Overall, the data presented in this manuscript are done well and support the claims made by the authors. We outline some major and minor adjustments aimed at aiding the clarity of reporting and presentation. Major comments Page 10, Lines 286-289: We felt it was somewhat unsupported that F-actin accumulation in the trailing half of the cell was ‚Äúconsistent with the idea depolymerizing microtubules increases RhoA activity at the rear of the cell.‚Äù While the data clearly show a disruption in F-actin distribution with nocodazole treatment, we felt it was not clear that this would increase F-actin in the trailing half rather than evenly throughout the cell. Our lack of expertise in the field may lead to our misinterpretation of this sentence, however we felt additional explanation is needed (e.g. on the Lifeact-mRuby reporter) to clarify the section and support the conclusions drawn. Consider including a schematic of the model to ease interpretation of the data shown in Figure 4. Minor comments Page 2: It may be more effective to explicitly introduce RhoA/ROCK in the introduction rather than first mentioning it on page 10. This could connect your ideas more thoroughly, even if it‚Äôs just a brief mention in the introduction. Page 3, Line 102: You mention that the mpeg1.1 promoter labels multiple macrophage populations. Is there a concern that you‚Äôre labeling more than Langerhans cells in the epidermis, and that cells could be confused due to their altered morphology during the treatment? Page 3: The writing may be clearer if all acronyms (i.e. EMTB as ensconsin microtubule binding domain, EB3 as end-binding 3) are defined at their first use. Figure 1D: We found this panel somewhat difficult to interpret. Consider showing this panel in two dimensions displaying the percentage of EMTB+ dendrites as a function of the number of dendrites per cell. Figure 1K: It appears that the nocodazole treatment has one outlier (value of 100 ¬µm). Does removing this datapoint change the significance of the treatment on maximum dendrite length? Figure 2E: It was unclear how the distance between the MTOC and phagosome was determined, i.e. whether the phagosome was measured from the point most distal or proximal to the cell body. Figure 2J: We thought your data would be most effective if you showed both the number and percentage of engulfment events for both control and nocodazole-treated cells to demonstrate how many events happened under each condition. Figure 3B: It appears that there are fewer Langerhans cells present in nocodazole-treated samples. Is this a significant impact or just coincidence in the images shown? Furthermore, could off-target effects or toxicity be impacting the migration differences seen here? Page 10, Line 263-264: There may be a typo here, where it‚Äòs omitted that the ‚ÄúLangerhans cells had a smaller meandering index‚Äù were nocodazole-treated. Figure 4: A quantification of RhoA activation, e.g., using immunoblot, would be stronger evidence to support the conclusion that disruption of microtubules alters actin polarity through the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. This may be technically challenging: can one compare pulled-down microtubules to quantify RhoA binding between treated and non-treated? Figure 5: We‚Äôre interested to see if nocodazole-treated Langerhans cells would respond similarly to vehicle-treated (5C) or paclitaxel-treated (5D-E), especially considering the impacts of nocodazole on dendrite morphology (decreased cell dendrite number with increased length) you showed in Fig. 1G and Supplemental Video 3. We don't think this is a necessary experiment but may be worth including to provide alternative evidence of the impact of microtubule alteration on cell migration. We also found the placement of Figure 4 to disrupt the line of thinking connecting Figure 3 and 5. Consider moving Figure 5 after Figure 3 for logical flow, as Figure 4 is more mechanistic and addressing the question of the role actin plays in this process. Page 14, Line 385: It seems there may be a typo here, where ‚Äún=128 cells counted from N=13 scales‚Äù should include that these are in paclitaxel conditions. Page 14, Line 395: You mention that ‚Äúacute chemical perturbations‚Äù were used in this paper. We thought that the laser ablation and/or scratch injury assays may be more accurately described as a physical or mechanical perturbation rather than chemical, but this may be from a lack of familiarity with writing conventions within the field. Page 15: In the second paragraph under ‚ÄúCell motility,‚Äù there‚Äôs no name given for the image processing software used, which we think it would be helpful to include. Methods, Line 522: Could you write the exact percentage of DMSO used for the vehicle controls either here or directly in the figure legends. Supplemental Videos: We found your supplemental videos extremely informative. Would it be possible to include these in the main text?

Our studies in fact described that psilocybin increased sociability in animal models of autism and noted the absence of such effects in control (normal) mice.

The implication of questioning the therapeutic efficacy of psilocybin in neuropsychiatric conditions - built on observations in the absence of such conditions to begin with - would be misleading and illogical.

There are major problems with Enformer's pre-computed variant effect scores. The main summary is that in Enformer's precomputed scores they estimate the variant effect by comparing the allelic differences in total signal of predicted profiles of ~100 Kb length. So the effect of variants is greatly dampened. If u estimate the local effect size i.e the allelic effect of signal over 1Kb around the variant, you get much better predictions.

The authors found that wild type Arabidopsis root hair cells feature high levels of autophagy, measured by the presence of autophagic bodies while mutants in autophagy genes (ATG2, ATG5, and ATG7) show diminished levels of autophagic bodies. The root hairs of these autophagy mutants deteriorate at earlier time points than those of wild type seedlings, while displaying markers of developmental programmed cell death which are not found in young wild type root hair cells. They also found that, unlike similar phenotypes in other tissues, the premature degradation of root hair cells is not dependent on salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, or ethylene signaling, as double mutants in these pathways still presented early root hair collapse. Finally, they examined triple mutants in ATG2 and programmed cell death transcription factors ANAC046 and ANAC087 and found that mutations in these genes suppressed the early root hair cell death phenotype. This study reports interesting results that advance the field of developmental biology in roots with elegant single-cell resolution, we provide below some suggestions to increase the reproducibility of the work and clarity for a broader audience. Major comments - In the Introduction, there could be more elaboration on what the functions of the chosen autophagy genes are, as well as if there is any redundancy between them. In the text of the Results or the Methods section, an explanation of the types of mutations of each atg mutant would be helpful, as well as a justification for using a specific atg mutant in one experiment but not others (atg7 in Fig2A, and atg5 or atg2 throughout), using ATG8a as the autophagy reporter (Fig1) and using mutant atg7-2 with the H2A-GFP reporter, while the TOIM reporter was used for the other atg mutants (Fig2D, E). - In the text of the Results or the Methods section, more detail of how the confocal images were taken would be required for reproducibility, such as contrast settings, how software (ex: Fiji) was used, camera type. - To strengthen the conclusion that ATG5 expression in the xylem does not complement, although probably technically challenging, consider including evidence that it is expressed. - The Discussion section could benefit from a deeper discussion of the results that were obtained e.g. are there other mutations that cause a root-hair less phenotype? If so, what is the phenotype of such mutants? What happens if you grow the plants longer, would an atg mutant eventually have more root hairs? It would also be interesting to include your thoughts on some of the mechanisms behind the antagonistic relationship of autophagy and programmed cell death, could there be a direct interaction between a given ATG and ANAC046 and/or 087? A discussion of the possible redundancy between ANAC046 and 087 would be of interest. Would the single mutation of either in the atg2 background not rescue the premature root hair cell death? In Figure 4F, the ANAC046 line L7 has a few root hair tips remaining at the root junction, compared to line L4, which seems to have no root hairs. Could this be due to variable level of expression under the pE7 promoter? Minor comments - dPCD and ePCD are described in the introduction, and the meanings can be inferred, but it might be clearer to explain those abbreviations outright. - Supplemental Figure 2A, dotted line in atg5-1 image is not explained, so it is not clear if it is the same as the dotted line in earlier figures (which outline the root profile). - Figure 2 heading, ‚ÄúThe loss function of autophagy...‚Äù should read ‚ÄúThe loss of function.‚Äù - At the end of the results section ‚Äú... the premature dPCD of root hairs in atg mutants dependents on canonical‚Äù should read depends. - Supplementary Figure 1H is missing a caption. It seems that the caption for Figure 1G may have been intended to address both figure panels from its description. - To fully validate the new atg2-8 and atg2-9 mutants, consider including ATG2 RNA or protein expression compared to atg2-2. - Define what the TOIM reporter is and what the acronym stands for. - Fig1A, B, C: Each of the representative confocal images has a right-hand panel showing a merged image, but their purpose is not fully clear. An explanation in the figure legend would be helpful for clarity. The cytosolic level of fluorescence makes it difficult to distinguish the difference between autophagic bodies and background fluorescence, consider including the details of image acquisition in this case to ensure the comparison between WT and mutants is suitable. - Figure 1E: Longitudinal is spelt wrong. - Figure 1E: In the figure caption atg7-2 and atg5-1 are mentioned but not shown. - Figure 3B: The figure is cut off and is written as ‚ÄúmCher‚Äù. Figure 2A, 3D, 3G, 3H, and 4F: The scale bars were also cut off (or are lacking). - Could you explain the nomenclature pPASPA3>>H2A-GFP reporter name written with the ‚Äú>>‚Äù symbol instead of a colon. - In Figure 3B and 3F, the y-axis shows the number of cells expressing pPASPA3. It is not entirely clear in the text how this was counted: was this done using the H2A-GFP reporter? - In Figure 3F, the line L1 appears to have a slightly lower number of cells expressing pPASPA3. Are there any possible reasons for this (such as differences in Cas9 targeting in different lines)? - Statistical analyses: consider including an explanation for using t-test or ANOVA. - The cross section of the root seen in Figure 3 could be helpful in Figure 1, since Figure 1E features a cross section confocal as part of the ConA imaging and/or include a symbol to indicate orientation on both the transverse and longitudinal section views.

It is named ¬´ the felid from Iron Age Entzheim, France ¬ª. Apart from the absence of any citation of the analysis of this specimen that needs to be introduced, there are several scientific problems in the way it is used: 1.	It is not clear which specimen was used in this analysis. No measurements are indicated in tables S3 and S4 and the specimen is used in Fig. S2 simply named ¬´ the felid from Iron Age Entzheim, France ¬ª, but there are two mandibles that I analyzed: one comes from site 4752 Entzheim-Geispolsheim ""A√©roparc-Lidl"" excavated in 2006 and the other from site 5046 Entzheim-Geispolsheim ""Lotissement d‚Äôactivit√©s Entzheim 4"" excavated in 2008. As the authors of the present study did not contact me, they did not have my measurements. Therefore, it is not clear how the indicated measurements were taken and on which specimen. 2.	In legend of Fig. S2 ¬´ A) Mandible and B) cheektooth row lengths (P4 - M1) (numbers upper case) ¬ª are problematic. First, as it is a mandible, these measurements should be indicated as (P4 - M1) (i.e., numbers as lower case) and not as (P4 - M1) (numbers as upper case). Second, it is unclear why the authors measured (P4 - M1) and not (P3 ‚Äì M1), as they did in table S4 and for the axis of Fig. S2B. Finally, the length (P3 ‚Äì M1) is shown as to be ~24,5mm, while the measurements of this trait I took on the complete mandibles before sampling for the paleogenetic study (published in 2017) are very different.

Chargaff circa 1950 discovered that DNA base composition (not sequence) was a species characteristic, simply expressed as GC% (as opposed to AT%). 2. So, there were GC%-rich species and AT%-rich species, with the exact values differing between species. 3. We biochemists and others discovered circa 1990 that actually the difference was due to short sequences (k-mers). 4. Thus, for k=3.

But just by assessing the k-mer patterns in the fragments, those corresponding to each species can be identified. 8. Then you can look at the fragments corresponding to one species and examine long sections to identify gene sequences (viewed as ""sentences"" or ""word strings""). 9. So, k-mers can be seen as the ""accent"" or ""dialect"" of DNA that relates to what species it belongs to. Unless you take that into account you cannot make a new species by just inserting a few genes to change appearance. 10. Just as accent can influence reproductive choices between humans (remember Eliza Doolittle), so it influences the reproductive isolation that is the defining characteristic of a species.

But just by assessing the k-mer patterns in the fragments, those corresponding to each species can be identified. 8. Then you can look at the fragments corresponding to one species and examine long sections to identify gene sequences (viewed as ""sentences"" or ""word strings""). 9. So, k-mers can be seen as the ""accent"" or ""dialect"" of DNA that relates to what species it belongs to. Unless you take that into account you cannot make a new species by just inserting a few genes to change appearance. 10. Just as accent can influence reproductive choices between humans (remember Eliza Doolittle), so it influences the reproductive isolation that is the defining characteristic of a species.

I have a few questions related to the benchmark.  The comparison between PanSpace and GSearch for space requirement is not clear to me because it says very clear in the abstract of GSearch paper that, it only requires 2.5G space using the SetSketch option, which is around 6G only for AllThebacteria, but not 80G for the default ProbMinHash option. ProbMinHash is very space inefficient since it considered all kmers and their abundance while SetSketch is very space efficient and also fast (not so fast as the fastest option Densified MinHash). Also, for genus level classification, GSearch can be done in amino acid space (after predicting genes), which ANI in nt space will lose accuracy (a well know problem). Can the genus level benchmark be done also in amino acid space, which is also clearly there in abstract (3-step framework). Thanks!

The authors identify and characterize a novel anti-phage defense system that is encoded in the genome of the prophage focusing on the ORF65 protein renamed TerI (for terminase inhibitor). The study shows that TerI inhibits phage reproduction by targeting the phage terminase complex of invading phages, thus preventing the packaging of phage DNA. Azulay et al. also discover two other prophage encoded proteins that provide the phage with immunity against its own TerI protein and thus enable packaging of its own genetic material. This preprint is well-written and contains high-quality data that advances the field of phage biology and anti-phage defense systems. We provide below some suggestions to strengthen the methodology, and to increase the clarity in the interpretation of the results. Major comments A loading control is required in Figure 1B, 2F, 2G, and 4D to verify that the amount of protein entered into each well is the same either using an antibody against a protein that does not change or using Coomassie or Ponceau stain of the membrane. Additionally, relative quantification (to the loading control) of immunoblots would be helpful to measure the loss of ORF65 co-sedimentation in the ŒîterSL mutant (Figure 2G) to strengthen the finding that ORF65/TerI interacts with TerS. For Figure 2F, a quantification of the immunoblot, ideally including a dilution series, would further support the statement that both the bacterial strains, expressing ORF65 or not, produced or released a similar number of capsids. Page 11: ‚Äúectopic expression of each of these genes alone (i.e., without TerI expression) did not affect virion production, as compared to WT bacteria, suggesting that the encoded proteins play a specific role in neutralizing TerI.‚Äù In Figure 3D, the ectopic expression of LMRG_01518 shows a large standard deviation reaching about 50%WT in PFU, suggesting that overexpression of LMRG_01518 may impact virion production. We recommend showing individual data points of each replicate and to provide a possible explanation for this high standard deviation. Page 12: ‚ÄúAltogether, these findings indicated that TerI is fully active during 10403S induction and that LMRG_01518 and LMRG_02984 counteract its activity, functioning as self-immunity proteins that allow 10403S DNA packaging and virion assembly‚Äù. However, only LMRG_02984 directly interacts with TerI and not LMRG_01518 (Figure 3H). This data may explain the stronger phage …∏10403S rescue consistently observed when LMRG_02984 is present compared to LMRG_01518 (Figure 3E). There is a question as to whether the results, as currently reported, fully support the direct interaction of LMRG_01518 with TerI. The study could incorporate a BACTH assay between LMRG_02984 and LMRG_01518 to support that conclusion, or the text could be revised to ensure the conclusions tightly align to the findings currently included (e.g. the model in Figure 5 depicts direct interaction between anti-TerI1(01518) and TerI). The discussion, while well-written, reads more like a minireview and could focus more on the findings. It could be expanded by elaborating more on the data presented and how it supports the model presented in Figure 5. Of particular interest is the discussion of LMRG_01518 inhibiting TerI function although not interacting with TerI directly. Other interesting points to discuss include the specificity of the TerI/anti-TerI1, I2 system, could the invading phage encode anti-TerI as well? How about the TerI/TerS specificity, from the data presented, it seems that TerI is able to inhibit TerS from different phages. Is there anything known about the function of LMRG_01518 and LMRG_02984 besides their role as anti-TerI? On Figure 3C, it seems that expression of LMRG_01517 largely decreases PFU compared to control, this result could be discussed. We realize it is beyond the scope of this study, but it would be of interest to perform a BLAST search with terI. This novel anti-phage defense system might be used by other temperate phages in other bacteria. It would be interesting to see how many other phages use this system. Or perhaps this is something exclusive to the Lm phages? Minor comments - Page 6: could you explain the choice of not using the his-tagged ORF65 from Figure 1E and on. We understand this may be technically difficult due to lack of specific antibodies against TerI and anti-TerI1 and 2, but something that was not obvious to us was whether the ectopic expression of ORF65 resulted in overexpression compared to endogenous levels in WT and whether exogenous infection leads to anti-terI1 and anti-terI2 expression. Figure 1F, we would have expected higher PFU than WT in the ATG*orf65 if ORF65 is present in WT to prevent virion production, and Figure 1G, we would have expected some level of PFU if anti-TerI are present to counteract TerI. There is a sentence that could be clarified ‚ÄúTo this end, we infected Lm bacteria cured of …∏10403S and deleted the comKgene with free particles of …∏10403S in the presence or absence of orf65 ectopic expression (i.e‚Ä¶).‚Äù Consider breaking it into two: ‚ÄúWe made ŒîcomK Lm bacteria cured of …∏10403S (Lm Œî…∏10403S-ŒîcomK). We then infected Lm Œî…∏10403S-ŒîcomK with …∏10403S particles in the presence or absence of orf65 ectopic expression‚Ä¶‚Äù - Page 11: could you clarify the following sentence ‚Äúcro (corresponding to the first early gene)‚Äù and define the acronym cro in the first instance. It is not clear to us whether cro itself is considered an early gene as it represses early genes. - Methods: could you describe how the ATG*orf65 mutation was exactly made and explain the choice of this mutation as opposed to deleting the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the rpsD promoter (if it contains one). Could you also explain why the mutagenesis of the -10 box of the orf65 promoter involved 5 bases and not less. - Figure 1A (and 3A): LMRG_01515 is labeled as LMRG_1515, include the missing zero in the locus number. - Figure 1C, 1E, 2C, 2D: plot growth curves on a log scale rather than linear as it is standard in the field. - Figure 1F, 3C, 3D: y-axis of PFU (% WT) needs to be consistent and should be put on a linear scale rather than a logarithmic scale as it is standard in the field. Provide number of replicates in the panel (such as N = 3). - Figure 1H: clarify which ones are lytic or temperate (prophages) in the panel by adding labels below the phage names. Also, keep consistent the nomenclature of the phages in the text to match figures (phage names missing phi symbol in text). - Figure 2F: could you explain the choice of quantifying attP rather than attB. - Figure 2E: increase scale size and keep panel sizes consistent and aligned. - Figure 2G: explain the low level of ORF65 detected in the ŒîŒ¶ pellet in the first panel. Are the ŒîterS and ŒîterL mutants available, it would be of interest to test these as well to strengthen the BACTH assay in Figure 2H showing direct interaction with TerS but not L. This may be technically challenging, but all samples could be run on one gel to produce one blot, if possible, for ease of comparison. - Figure 3: for consistency in the panels presented, the nomenclature used to describe LMRG_02984 and LMRG_01518 should not be changed to anti-TerI1 and anti-TerI2. - Figure 3A: make the phage genome image larger and include description in the legend. - Figure 3H: LMRG_01518 was included as part of the negative controls.

However, it should be noted that the relationship between genotype and phenotype isn‚Äôt fully understood. Also, we know from other ancient DNA studies that the derived alleles in genes SLC24A5 and SLC45A2 associated with light skin pigmentation in Europeans today were either fixed or at high frequency in the Neolithic Anatolian population. Previous studies have linked the introduction of light skin in western, central and southern Europe as coming with the Neolithic Anatolian farmers. Eastern hunter-gatherers seem to have carried these alleles already, so Eastern Europe and Scandinavia followed a different trend. Your method predicted darker skin in the Neolithic Anatolians based on genomes that have already been published, which contradicts the original research, but you ignored this in your paper. The earlier findings need to be taken into consideration here - why does your method contradict these findings? And if you deem your method superior, then how and when did these alleles get introduced in western/southern Europe if it wasn‚Äôt with the Anatolian farmers? And why did your method predict darker skin pigmentation in this population when they carried the same derived alleles as modern Europeans?",2025-04-08T12:36:14,,MM,10.1101/2025.01.29.635495,Inference of human pigmentation from ancient DNA by genotype likelihood,"Silvia Perretti, Maria Teresa Vizzari, Patr√≠cia Santos, Enrico Tassani, Andrea Benazzo, Silvia Ghirotto, Guido Barbujani",2025-02-12

Promega also conveniently doesn't mention that the readily available and cheaper bis-CTZ can be used with Nanoluc with very similar results (though, Satoshi Inouye had reported this in 2013). For years, I've been asking around in the bioluminescence if someone has determined it but no one did. Eventually, I've realized that I can simply determine it from absorbance. ""When you understand the laws of physics, anything is possible"" #TBBT. üéÜ All the four compounds (CTZ, bis-CTZ, CTZ-h, frZ) and many other c≈ìlenterazine-derived compounds have the same core set of conjugated double bonds which gives them an absorbance peak around 425-440 nm and, hence, a yellow color: see the linked slide with spectra of CTZ, bis-CTZ and furimazine. So, it seems that one can safely use the same molar absorption coefficient for all of them. I like to use Œµ=10000 L/(mol‚ãÖcm) in ethanol (or methanol) since batches of CTZ and bis-CTZ of high purity can slightly exceed this value according to their certificates of analysis (see the linked image). The furimazine solution in the spectra illustration was diluted from the N1110 reagent stock (catalog # N113A tube in this kit) For Promega reagents, such measurements give 3.42 mM furimazine for the "" Nano-Glo¬Æ Luciferase Assay System"" ( catalog # N1110 - used in this preprint) and 0.58 mM furimazine for the "" Nano-Glo¬Æ Live Cell Assay System"" ( catalog # N2011). So, the 1:500 dilution is 6.8 ŒºM furimazine, 1:1000 - 3.4 ŒºM, 1:100 dilution is 34 ŒºM furimazine.",2025-04-07T01:00:17,michaelkoksharov,Misha Koksharov,10.1101/2023.06.25.546478,CaBLAM!
