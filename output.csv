The study identifies ten transcriptional clusters and two distinct trypomastigote subtypes, revealing a continuous differentiation trajectory and highlighting RNA-binding proteins as key post-transcriptional regulators. The main contribution of this work is providing a comprehensive reference atlas that transforms our understanding of T. cruzi development from discrete stages to a continuous, dynamically regulated process. The methodology is convincing, combining single-cell and bulk RNA-seq validation, though it remains limited by static sampling and the lack of experimental confirmation for specific regulatory factors. Overall, the paper is clearly written, logically structured, and conceptually strong. It offers a lasting impact by establishing a foundational dataset for exploring gene regulation and parasite differentiation at single-cell resolution.",2025-10-15T19:30:36,disqus_YjNnIHTrTc,Chenxi Sun,,,,

Interestingly, these new data suggest that miR-1229-3p inhibition leads to lower mitochondrial activity and mitochondrial dysfunction, although not to the extent that mitophagy is increased, ultimately leading to altered Ca2+ regulation and dendritic arborisation. Despite this mitochondrial dysfunction, miR-1229-3p inhibition enhances synaptogenesis, and so this contrasts with Iwata et al. (ref. 32 in their manuscript) where it is reported that decreasing mitochondrial metabolism slows neuronal development. How can the authors’ findings be reconciled with Iwata et al.? Mito-ER interactions are considered in the discussion and indeed they mention that MERC regulation by miR-1229-3p could be a mechanism in human neurons contributing to slowing of mitochondrial metabolism and associated neuronal maturation. However, their findings don’t appear to support the premise that impaired mitochondrial metabolism slows neuronal maturation. I would be interested in additional discussion on this point. Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author): The authors have sincerely addressed all reviewer comments, and the revised manuscript is considered to be of a much higher quality compared to the initial submission. While they have not performed a specific experiment for every point I suggested, their explanations for not doing so are convincing, which I find acceptable. The current version of the manuscript is suitable for publication and does not have any major issues. Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Author): The authors have addressed all concerns sufficiently.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.22.677690v1#comment-6782553111,biorxivstage,0,"A recent study by Emond-Rheault et al. provided an extensive analysis of the coding and non-coding transcriptome of Leishmania infantum developmental stages using Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (PMID: 40597600). The considerable depth of their sequencing—achieving 5.2 to 6.9 million reads and approximately 150-190% genome coverage for both promastigote and amastigote stages—enabled statistically powerful comparative studies. Their work precisely determined the primary spliced leader (SL) and poly(A) sites for the majority of L. infantum protein-coding transcripts, accurately defining their 5’ and 3’ ends and the lengths of their UTRs. It also provided further evidence for SL cleavage site motifs and better defined the genomic context for cleavage and polyadenylation. The accuracy of the transcriptome annotation was supported by cross-validation with Illumina RNA-Seq. Furthermore, the study quantified the frequency of primary SL and poly(A) sites and compared alternative polyadenylation events between the developmental stages. Additionally, this analysis uncovered a rich repertoire of newly annotated lncRNAs, which generally exhibit distinct expression patterns from their cognate 3’UTRs. The protein-coding potential of a subset of these lncRNAs was rigorously investigated by LC-MS/MS and the expression of proteins of selected lncRNAs was confirmed using CRISPR–Cas9-mediated tagging and western blot analysis. Several of these lncRNAs are developmentally regulated, showing higher expression in amastigotes, underscoring their potential importance during intracellular development. The current work by Dumetz et al., which combines PacBio HiFi de novo assembly with Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing of Leishmania donovani promastigotes and axenic amastigotes, would be greatly strengthened by considering the recent study on L. infantum. A comparative analysis between these two closely related species could address compelling biological questions regarding gene expression, UTR conservation and length, RNA processing, and the presence of known and novel 3’UTR regulatory motifs. However, the low number of Nanopore reads obtained for L. donovani axenic amastigotes (only 648,426) drastically reduces the statistical power and reliability of comparative analyses between the two life stages. The discovery of putative RNA G-quadruplexes in over 56% of L. donovani 3’UTRs is a novel finding. It would be interesting to investigate whether these sequences are conserved in the 3’UTRs of the closely related L. infantum. Nonetheless, in the absence of experimental validation, it is premature to suggest these motifs are main drivers of post-transcriptional regulation, particularly given the many other validated 3’UTR regulatory elements known in Leishmania spp. It is a limitation that the authors did not search for these established elements in their analysis. Finally, the crucial role of 3’UTRs in controlling mRNA fate in Leishmania has been widely documented, and it is regrettable that the authors did not discuss their findings within this broader context. I hope these suggestions are helpful in strengthening the study. Respectfully,",2025-10-15T00:31:44,,Gabriel Ferreira,,,,

Our publication focuses on the nonimmune incompatibility between two species, which is why we concentrated on compromised oxygen delivery between mother and fetus. I have read the paper you mentioned and completely agree that multiple mechanisms were most likely involved in the decline of archaic populations. While Piezo1 also defines a blood group, the amino acids responsible for blood group type are located in the extracellular domain and do not influence Piezo1 channel properties (PMID: 36122374, Figure 4) or, consequently, RBC metabolism. The choice of the Ser307Gly variant was inspired by Svante Pääbo’s lecture, in which he compared archaic protein variants with modern ones based on 1000 Genomes data. A list of the proteins can be found in the supplementary materials of PMID: 24679537. At that time, protein alleles with low frequencies (<1%) were not detectable in such a small sample of modern genomes. The Ser307Gly variant appears to have undergone negative selection. For example, the archaic allele of a Piezo1-linked gene, MC1R, reached up to 70% in some East Asian populations (PMID: 24916031), but the archaic Piezo1 variant is absent in these individuals, as genomic data were obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project. Another archaic allele of Piezo1, E1839K, is preserved at higher frequencies. I did not verify this variant in archaic genomes, but its designation as archaic is based on comparative analysis. Approximately 5% of Asians (gnomAD) and all other modern hominid species carry K instead of E, reflecting a prevalence rate more consistent with neutral expectations for an archaic allele. Thank you for mentioning Denisovans. I did not examine their sequence, but I would expect that most archaic humans carried this variant, particularly if our hypothesis regarding the reproductive barrier is correct.",2025-10-14T15:48:16,asyamakhro,Asya Makhro,,,,

Particularly, you find out that acute induction of IFNa and NF-Kb in immune cells is the crtical determinant of LAMV attenuation. You have contributed the field by discovering the molecular level findings of LAMV attenuation, which provides possible strategies on designing future vaccines. This is a breakthrough contribution, since such detailed observation of vaccine attenuation have never been done before. The methodology is convincing, since you have applied In-vitro and In-vivo to support your findings. These experiments are well-designed and their results corresponds to each other, which strengthens your conclusion. Conflicts of the results have also been explained. The most important limitation of these two approach is that they could not fully explain the mechanism of attenuation in human bodies, considering differences between human and experiment animals.

One analysis that could sharpen the biological interpretation of the ~10–11% EBV DNAemia group is per-individual, gene-level EBV coverage profiles. A simple addition could be: (1) Per-sample coverage heatmaps across the EBV genome (normalized depth, with masked loci excluded). (2) Summary indices contrasting latency-associated regions (e.g., EBNA1/2/3, LMP1/2, RPMS1/BARTs) vs lytic genes (BZLF1/BRLF1/BMRF1/BALF5/late capsid). (3) A “flatness/entropy” metric to distinguish uniform episomal coverage from focal peaks consistent with fragmentation or reactivation. It would really help interpretation because gene-level coverage tells you what biology you’re actually capturing in that ~10–11% tail. If coverage is flat across the EBV genome, that’s more consistent with cell-associated episomes and high-load latency; if you see focal enrichment over immediate-early/early/late loci, that points toward reactivation or fragmented cfDNA. That distinction changes how we read the HLA/ERAP2 signals (antigen presentation under lytic pressure vs control of latent burden), tightens the PheWAS (different disease links are expected for latent-heavy vs reactivation-enriched samples), and avoids over-generalizing a single “DNAemia” phenotype. It also matters for downstream hypotheses and clinical framing: a reactivation-prone subgroup suggests monitoring/treatment angles very different from stable latent carriage.

I am appreciated for this key method and so impressive of how well of the work it done. Scaling AMAPEC across 150 genomes reveals that the antimicrobials like secreted proteins are enriched among widely shared and conserved clades. Moreover, from the prediction of biology for “wet-lab” tests indicate that five canonical effectors display direct antimicrobial activity in vitro. The Vd424Y knockout experiment is also impressive. Especially for the figure 4 Panel B, the direct field plant control groups are super impressive. It also emphasized the Vd424Y knock out only presented the impact on plant with the microbes enrichment soil.

I’d rate its significance a 4 out of 5, since this finding changes how we think about mitochondrial transfer, giving it a new signaling role in tumor biology. The experiments are carefully designed — live-cell imaging, RNA-seq, and biosensors all support the conclusions — but most data are from in vitro models, so it’s still unclear how much this process matters in real tumors. The main limitation is the lack of in vivo validation, which would make the story more convincing.

Which, can help mitigate the transmission of these disease to humans. Not only in malaria transmission but in other vector-borne diseases as well.

The paper is already accepted with few modifications from the version you see here, and it will be published soon. A 10:1 ratio as a rule of thumb seems a bit excessive. It is true that this reflects my results for 20 taxa for some combinations of TL and number of states, but in other combinations it seems like 100 characters are sufficient. Also, this ratio might get slightly smaller with more taxa. I think that the fairest answer would be that it really depends a lot on the dataset and on the properties of the sampled characters, but if one needs a universal rule-of-thumb ratio I would suggest something closer to 5:1. I did not explore how adding taxa impacts the estimate of the relationships of a few selected ""key"" taxa, but that is a very interesting idea. I cannot think right now about a mechanism that would actually improve the estimate for the ""key"" taxa, except maybe breaking up long branches. When I started to think about metrics to evaluate my simulation results, I did use both RF distance and CID. I noticed that the pattern of these two metrics relative to the varying parameters was very similar, so I ended up keeping only the RF distances because it was easier to explain those values intuitively and pick a threshold value. I am actually curious to know your take on what constitutes a ""good-enough"" CID value (satisfyingly accurate topology) for an estimated tree compared to the true tree. In the supplementary material of the final version of the manuscript, I do have included some PCoA plots of pairwise CID distances of posterior distributions, MAP trees, and true tree, to visually explore tree distances of the whole posterior compared to the true tree as a function of the number of characters. As for the convergence of the topologies, I honestly gave up on that because (especially for the 100-200 taxa trees) it was taking a VERY long time to calculate for ALL the simulations between-runs split frequencies and ESS in the convenience R package (I don't know about the speed of that in the treess package). The few simulation inferences that I managed to check seemed to converge fine on topology, and I don't see any particular reason why there would be systematic convergence problems on the other simulations (the model is very simple, it is correctly implemented/validated, and it matches how the data was generated). I do totally agree that checking topological convergence should be an important part of empirical phylogenetic analyses that is often neglected.",2025-10-09T13:57:32,disqus_AM6Kuv2CIm,Alessio,,,,

The new preprint refers to Extended Data Figures and Supplementary videos that are unfortunately not provided at bioRxiv. Nevertheless, the manuscript text and the 5 main figures plus a proposed model contain a couple of major issues that I will cover here. A thread containing my comments plus useful illustrations is available on X ( https://x.com/ralfhadams/status/1976179960558539006). But before I do so, let me give you a little background. Several papers over the recent years have proposed that the bone marrow (BM) in skull is specialized and acts as an immune cell reservoir for the brain parenchyma and the meninges, a multilayered tissue structure that encloses and protects the brain and spinal cord. Key evidence comes from landmark publications by the groups of Matthias Nahrendorf (Herisson et al. 2018, PMID: 30150661), Jonathan Kipnis (Cugurra et al. 2021, PMID: 34083447), Ali Ertürk (Kolabas et al. 2023, PMID: 37562402) and others. Kolabas et al. 2023, for example, provide compelling results showing that skull “has the most distinct transcriptomic profile compared with other bones in states of health and injury” with potential relevance for neurological pathologies. The same publication also reveals that skull shows a strong response to stroke, arguing for interactions between the brain and a nearby bone marrow compartment. Our paper from 2024 shows that the BM of skull is undergoing substantial expansion in adult life but also during aging, which applies both to stromal cells (including vasculature) and a large range of hematopoietic cell subsets including stem and progenitor populations. Our paper makes use of well-established immunolabeling and imaging enabled by the injection of antibodies into living animals before they were sacrificed for tissue isolation. The removal of external tissues, including the meninges/dura mater on the brain side and dermal tissue on the skin side enabled undisturbed insights into the organization and expansion of bone marrow vessels, which exhibit the distinct dilated and irregular morphology typical for the sinusoidal vasculature of the BM. It is also noteworthy (and will be relevant later) that the expansion of the BM vasculature starts in frontal and parietal bones at the edges (near the sutures) and gradually progresses toward to center in young adult mice (10-14 weeks), whereas the interparietal bone is already filled with vessels (and hematopoietic cells) at this stage. Apart from imaging, we provide an extensive set of flow cytometry data in a large (22 page) supplemental file accompanying the paper, which confirms the expansion of stromal, endothelial, total hematopoietic cells and various hematopoietic cell subsets during adulthood and aging but also in response to various challenges (such as pregnancy and stroke). But even the skull of older mice is not spared from signs of aging. We observe that the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines is elevated in old skull in comparison to samples from younger mice. However, this affects fewer cytokines and involves lower levels of upregulation relative to age-matched (young and old) femur samples. Functionally, we show that shielding of either the head or the hindlimb allows the survival of young mice exposed to a lethal dose of irradiation (without BM transplantation). In irradiated old mice, however, only shielding of the head ensures survival, whereas animals with shielded legs gradually succumb over a period of 200 days, presumably reflecting the exhaustion of hematopoietic stem cells and early progenitor populations. These results and other evidence presented in the article led us to the conclusion that skull BM is more resilient to aging than its counterpart in femur. Now, let’s take a look at some of the claims raised by Yang et al. in their recent bioRxiv preprint. In Figure 1, they have reanalyzed selected subsets of scRNA-seq data from our publication to show that samples from old skull show hallmarks of aging compared to young skull. It is not clear (and is not explained) why certain samples from our data (available at GEO under the accession number GSE275179) were included in their analysis whereas other, equally suitable samples were excluded. In any case, it is not surprising and also not controversial that cells from old skull show an increase of aging markers compared to samples from young mice. We have never claimed that the skull BM stays young forever and, instead, we have reported the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines mentioned earlier together with other evidence such as myeloid-biased hematopoietic differentiation. Figure 2 of the Yang et al. preprint shows a comparison of mass spectrometry data from young (10 weeks) and old skulls/calvaria (79 weeks), which also indicates that markers of DNA damage and inflammation are upregulated, whereas markers of angiogenesis, osteogenesis and mitochondrial activity are downregulated. One would have liked to see a more detailed description of the sample preparation (e.g., were the meninges and other adherent/external tissues removed from the skull samples?), but the findings themselves are not surprising or controversial. Of course, old tissue samples show evidence of aging and are different from young skull samples. Things heat up a little in Figure 3 of the Yang et al. preprint. The authors claim that a dense, continuous network of vessels is found throughout skull samples from all ages and thereby challenge our observation that the calvarial vasculature and BM are dynamically expanding in adult mice. The evidence provided by Yang et al. includes transversal sections through the skull roof. The low magnification overview images in Figure 3b are of poor quality/resolution so that it is not possible to see much detail. The DAPI nuclear staining in the higher magnification images, however, suggests that the enlarged areas primarily correspond to tissue near the sutures, which already contain vasculature and some BM even in young frontal and parietal bones. Clearly, one would like to see better quality overview images and an unbiased comparison of central vs. peripheral areas from frontal and parietal bones. Things get more interesting and controversial in Figure 3c and d. Yang et al. use tissue clearing and light sheet microscopy to show the presence of a “continuous, dense vascular network throughout the skull frontal, parietal and interparietal regions in young mice”. The CD31 immunostaining in Fig. 3a, however, shows predominantly the meningeal vasculature, easily identifiable by hallmarks such as the sagittal and transverse sinuses consisting of large diameter blood and lymphatic vessels. Periosteal vessels might be also labeled, but it is not obvious that any sinusoidal vessels of the bone marrow are stained in this sample. Higher magnification images in Fig. 3d show more details of the meningeal (and perhaps also periosteal) vasculature in mice from different age groups. Again, it is very obvious that sinusoidal vessels with their distinctive morphology and large caliber are not captured in these samples. This is not surprising because expression of CD31 is low in sinusoidal (also termed type L) endothelial cells, as previous work from my group has established (Kusumbe et al. 2014, PMID: 24646994). Taken together, it is clear that Yang et al. have not carefully separated the vasculature of the skull and the adjacent meninges, leading to confusing results and wrong conclusions. Future research in this important field needs to clearly distinguish what is bone marrow, periosteal tissue, meninges or the surface of the adjacent brain. There is another small but interesting nugget hidden in Fig. 3c of the Yang et al. preprint. The freshly dissected skull sample prior to clearing shows distinctive areas of red blood cells in the interparietal bone but also in parts of the frontal bone. Our work has revealed a similar pattern of red blood cell distribution, representing regions of bone marrow, in freshly dissected young skull. In samples from older mice, these areas increase substantially, confirming the expansion of calvarial BM even in the absence of any immunostaining. Kolabas et al. 2023 (PMID: 37562402) also show a strikingly similar distribution of Nr4a1+ and propidium iodide (PI) labeled immune cells in calvarial bone marrow of young adult mice. Note the absence of immune cells in central regions of the frontal and parietal bone, whereas labeled cells (blue and red) are abundant in the interparietal bone. This is totally consistent with our own findings. Unfortunately, the sample showing aged skull is not included in the Yang et al. bioRxiv preprint so that a further comparison of young and old bone marrow will have to wait until the Extended Data Figures become publicly available. Before I move on, I would briefly like to address a technical detail. In the Yang et al. bioRxiv preprint, the authors claim that our Endomucin staining shows “aberrant nuclear localization”, which, according to them, suggests “that the current staining is artefactual and calls into question the reliability of their vascular imaging data”. This is just one of many strongly worded claims in the preprint. In reality, however, the Endomucin immunostaining shown by Yang et al. in the preprint is strongly overexposed, preventing any insight into the actual intracellular distribution of the antigen. The red (Endomucin) signal covers pretty much every part of the stained cells. The impact of different imaging and data presentation modalities, whole-mount vs. tissue sections and maximum intensity projection vs. isolated optical planes, also need to be considered. Furthermore, I have already mentioned that our study has used an in vivo labeling approach involving the injection of antibodies before the animals were sacrificed. This might lead to a slightly different pattern in comparison to post-fixation staining. Nevertheless, it is unambiguously clear that the bone marrow vasculature is stained reliably in Koh et al. 2024 (PMID: 39537918), revealing striking details of vessel architecture and regional differences. Before I continue with the next figure of the preprint, let’s have a quick look what other recent publications say about skull bone marrow. Chang et al. 2025 (PMID: 40970910), using advanced tissue clearing and light sheet imaging, report bone marrow expansion in a comparison of 2-month-old and 2-year-old skull samples. The data shown in Figure 5 of their publication independently confirms that large parts of the young calvarium are devoid of VEGFR3+ sinusoidal vessels, whereas older samples show a profound expansion of vessels, consistent with our own findings. A recent publication from the group of Warren Graham (Horenberg et al. 2025, PMID: 39984434) reports that “Emcn+ vessels demonstrated drastic morphological changes with aging, as bone marrow-resident sinusoidal blood vessel signal increases with age”. A recent publication from the group of Shukri Habib (Reeves et al. 2024, PMID: 39692737) has evaluated calvaria from mouse of different age groups by micro-computed tomography and other methods. In Figure 1A+B and the corresponding text, they state that “overall thickness from outer surface to inner surface of the parietal bone significantly increased with age” and they also show a striking increase of cavities (which, as we know, represent bone marrow areas) compared to young and adult calvarial bone. Overall, there is more and more emerging evidence supporting that the bone marrow in adult skull is expanding dynamically in adult mice, which involves changes in sinusoidal vessels but also in stromal and hematopoietic cell populations. Let’s return to the preprint by Yang et al. with a focus on Figure 4, which is another reanalysis of scRNA-seq data from Koh et al. 2024 (PMID: 39537918). This time, the focus is initially on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and CD45+ cells from young and old femur samples. According to the figure legend, this analysis is based on three samples – one from young and two from old femurs – that were subjected to the removal of hematopoietic cells prior to single cell sequencing. This depletion method is necessary to capture and enrich stromal cell populations, but these are obviously not samples that one would use for the analysis of hematopoietic cells. The remaining hematopoietic cells are residual contaminating cells that have escaped the depletion step, which is never totally complete. I would dispute that the analysis of contaminating cells allows meaningful conclusions about the abundance/enrichment of hematopoietic cell populations in aging femurs, but this seems to be exactly what Yang et al. have done. Could they have selected the wrong samples from our deposited data or mixed up the sample numbers? Who knows? In this context, I would like to point out that we had provided a substantial amount of information about our scRNA-seq data, the pretreatment of the different samples and other aspects of our methodology per email to Dr Kusumbe in early June 2025. Back to the preprint and Figure 5, which provides bulk mass spectrometry data comparing proteins from old vertebra and skull, which led the authors of the preprint to the conclusion that vertebrae are relatively protected from aging hallmarks in comparison to skull. The description of the methodology is unfortunately very brief. It is not clear which vertebrae were analyzed exactly (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, or all?). It is also not clear whether adherent muscle, fat, spinal cord and intervertebral discs were removed, all of which should influence substantially what is seen in the proteomic profile. In any case, it is obvious that this analysis is not confined to bone marrow and functional data for BM cells from vertebrae in comparison to other BM compartments is lacking. Obviously, future work will have to address how aging processes affect different BM compartments and thereby the function of the hematopoietic system. We are almost done, but I want to highlight another controversial aspect in the Yang et al. preprint, namely the presence (or absence) of lymphatic vessels inside bone. Based on the reanalysis of our scRNA-seq data from Koh et al., it is claimed in Fig. 1 and the accompanying text that lymphangiogenic markers are downregulated in aged skull samples. I would dispute that the presence of Cdh5+ Pecam1+ Prox1+ Ptprc- Flt4+ endothelial cells in the data supports the presence of lymphatic endothelial cells inside the skull bone or marrow. Chang et al. 2025 (PMID: 40970910), a publication that was already mentioned earlier, have examined this question in detail and they state that lymphatic vessels are present outside the skull in the periosteum but not inside bone marrow. The preparation of samples of skull and other tissues for scRNA-seq analysis is a race against time because it is essential to preserve RNA integrity as much as possible. This means that the removal of adherent, periosteal tissue residues including lymphatic vessels from the meningeal or the dermal side has to be done quickly, is most likely incomplete and might lead to residual contaminations. Essentially, the proposed presence of putative lymphatic endothelial cells in our data, which we have not validated ourselves, cannot resolve where these cells originate from. I want to conclude here and thank all of you who have read this thread till the end. As I have not been able to cover all issues in the preprint, I am considering another detailed thread once the Extended Data becomes public. I also hope that I have remained factual and sufficiently polite throughout my posts even though I perceive the language in the Yang et al. preprint as sometimes overly harsh and many claims unsubstantiated and wildly exaggerated. Final full disclosure: I am not only the last author of Koh et al. 2024 (PMID: 39537918) but also the former postdoctoral supervisor of the two last authors of the Yang et al. preprint.",2025-10-09T07:16:25,ralfhadams,Ralf H.

It would seem that the ""baseline setting"" (Figure 2) is unfairly favoring the semi-supervised methods. The same labels are used as input to guide integration AND for performance evaluation; this allows ss-methods to overfit the data, especially scGen and scDREAMER, which have many parameters.  Wouldn't it make sense to report the rankings based on a more realistic scenario, such as one with partial annotation or partially incorrect labels? On another note, silhouette coefficients have been reported to be suboptimal for this kind of benchmarks, and more appropriate metrics have been proposed, see e.g. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02743-4",2025-10-08T15:32:30,,M.A.,,,,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.27.656061v1#comment-6779669946,biorxivstage,2,"Since I was asked to review this paper several months ago and waived my anonymity on review, I'm sharing my review publicly here as a comment. The TL/DR is that I think this paper is both very informative, and very important. However, it does need to be contextualized as a deep study of a recovery cohort, which is then being compared to public data from cohorts with a significant percentage of people who are not recovering, and that needs to be accounted for. Comparing immune cells from the PBMC fraction of blood of people who all went on to recover to cells from tissue of cohorts including those made up of 40% people who did not go onto recover does not allow for making conclusions about differences between the blood and the tissue without accounting for the differences in immune responses of those on a trajectory to recover and those who are not. Those immune responses could look very different, both in the blood and in the tissue. Here is my full review: This is an important and comprehensive study by Rostomily et al., ""Multiomics Reveals Compartmentalized Immune Responses and Tissue-Vascular Signatures in Lyme Disease,"" which significantly advances our understanding of the immunopathology of acute Lyme disease (LD). I found it easy to read, and the figures were clear and compelling. By employing a longitudinal, multiomics approach integrating plasma proteomics, metabolomics, and PBMC immunophenotyping, supplemented with a meta-analysis of skin lesion transcriptomics, the authors present a compelling narrative of compartmentalized immunity. They propose that the robust alterations in circulating plasma proteins and metabolites, linked to endothelial barrier stability, metabolic reprogramming, and symptom severity, are predominantly driven by local immune processes within the skin and associated vasculature, while systemic PBMCs remain largely quiescent. It is quite surprising to see the PBMCs and metabolites show such fast resolution, and it feels like this is likely related to the complete recovery seen in this cohort.  This work offers novel insights into effective immune responses against Borrelia burgdorferi and the kinetics of recovery from infection, particularly highlighting vascular involvement, and provides a valuable resource for future biomarker discovery and therapeutic development in LD. A critical aspect for the authors to address, perhaps in the limitations or discussion, is the high recovery rate observed in their patient cohort. The manuscript states, ""Following antibiotic treatment, symptoms resolved in most patients, with only a few reporting mild symptoms attributable to LD at 6 months or at 1 year post-treatment"". This contrasts with broader literature suggesting that 10-20% of LD patients develop Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS) with persistent symptoms. It would be beneficial for the authors to discuss why their cohort experienced such a high recovery rate. Were specific exclusion criteria applied that might have inadvertently selected for individuals less prone to PTLDS (e.g., absence of certain co-morbid conditions known to be risk factors, that’s very interesting to speculate)? The methods section details exclusions such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, traumatic brain injury, prolonged undiagnosed somatic complaints, morbid obesity, sleep apnea, autoimmune disease, uncontrolled cardiopulmonary or endocrine disorders, recent malignancy, liver disease, major psychiatric illness, or substance abuse. While extensive, it's worth considering if these fully account for the low PTLDS rate. Additionally, the cohort demographics (Figure 1B) show a skew towards male patients (27 male vs. 22 female). Given that some infection-associated chronic illnesses, including potentially PTLDS, may skew female, could this gender distribution contribute to the observed recovery outcomes? Clarification on these points would help contextualize the study's findings regarding the typical immune trajectory of acute LD. Major Points: 1) Comparability of Meta-Analysis Cohorts: The conclusions regarding skin-derived systemic signals rely heavily on meta-analyses of public datasets (GSE63085, GSE154916, GSE169440). It is crucial to provide a more detailed comparison of the clinical characteristics (symptoms, treatment, PTLDS rates) of these external cohorts with the primary study cohort. For instance, the GSE63085 PBMC dataset is from a cohort with a reported PTLDS-like symptom rate of ~46%, substantially different from the near-complete recovery in the current study's cohort. These differences should be explicitly discussed as they could influence the nature and interpretation of immune responses. I wonder if the major differences seen in the skin vs PBMCs here are driven more by immune differences in people who are on a trajectory to recover vs those who are not. There are public datasets available on PBMCs as well, such as from the SLICE cohort including those on a trajectory to recover and those who are not. These should be compared in the analysis. 2) The finding of largely quiescent PBMCs in the face of infection and systemic mediator changes is surprising. The authors should expand their discussion to contextualize this observation against other types of infections, or Borrelia infections where people go on to develop borrelia infection-associated chronic illness. For example, how does this compare to PBMC responses in other chronic infections, tissue-localized (versus systemic/blood-borne) infections, or infections caused by slow-growing (like B. burgdorferi) versus fast-growing bacteria? Or, back to point #1, is this more just what PBMCs look like in someone who has been successfully treated with an antibiotic for a bacterial infection, and is this just what being on track to a full recovery looks like? That would explain why this looks so different from PBMC profiles in chronic illnesses like TB/HIV/HCV/ T. cruzi, but would make more sense in the context of a cleared infection and recovery. One additional thing to consider is that most of the immune granulocyte cells will be spun out of the PBMC fraction, but that does not mean those responses aren't circulating in the blood, they just won't be found in the PBMCs. 3) The T3 timepoint seems to stand out compared to T2 or T4, and it’s not clear why, and this isn’t adequately addressed in the discussion or limitations. Minor Points (Organized by Figure): Figure 1: Study overview and clinical manifestations Panel B: The gender distribution is skewed male. It would be useful to know if any sex-based differences in the measured parameters were analyzed, as this was not apparent throughout the manuscript. Panel C: The T3 (6 months) timepoint for C6 ELISA is missing; only T1, T2, and T4 are shown. Is that because T3 looks weird throughout, and you didn’t want to show it? Panel F: It would be helpful to indicate which correlations are statistically significant (e.g., using asterisks or by highlighting significant bubbles). Figure 2: Differential expression of circulating proteins and their correlation with symptoms Panel A: The separation into fast- and slow-resolving clusters is a very interesting and insightful presentation. However, the text states PRDX5 remained significantly elevated at T2, but this is not immediately clear from the heatmap's visual representation for PRDX5 in the T1-T2 comparison. Only IL17C is labeled as significant (T2-T3) in the slow responding genes. Panel B: It is unclear why not all rows are labeled as they appear in A across all pathway comparisons, which makes it harder to assess the full dynamics. Maybe this circles back to the fact that some of them were significant T1-T2, and not T1-3, but then again yes T1-4 so maybe it looked messy to show it that way? But this way you only show the first set it was significant for, and not the dynamics in between… Panel C and D: The rationale for selecting T1 versus T3 for this heatmap of cardiovascular, metabolism, and organ damage proteins could be clarified, especially as Panel A focuses on pairwise comparisons across all timepoints. And at other times T3 seems to be intentionally excluded. Displaying patient-based trends rather than just row-based averages might also be informative. The asterisks on the left indicating significance are somewhat hard to read on the opposite side from the label. Panel E: This is a visually appealing figure, though the bundling can make specific correlations slightly challenging to trace. Figure 3: Integrated community analysis and diagnostic modeling Panel A: Could the authors add descriptions of any shared features or overarching themes among the analytes within each of the three largest communities beyond endothelial disruption/protection? The rho scale for symptom correlations (-0.4 to 0.6) suggests many correlations are not very strong; indicating that adding statistical significance for these symptom correlations would be beneficial. Panel B, C, D: These ROC curves are interesting for diagnostic potential. Suggestion: If data are available, showing a baseline ROC curve using standard clinical diagnostic features (e.g., EM presence, basic serology if used for initial classification rather than just inclusion) could provide a useful comparison for the multiomic models. Figure 5: Minimal peripheral changes in acute LD Panel A: The highest variance explained by PC1 in the PCA of PBMC abundances is relatively low (18.4% for patients, 16.2% for controls), suggesting considerable heterogeneity not captured by the main principal components. Panel B: The decrease in plasmablasts over time would possibly be expected if it aligned with the development of memory B cells. But that doesn’t seem to be the case from this data. That might be a fit with what Nicole Baumgarth has described in B6 mice, and definitely warrants further discussion. Panel C: The UMAP visualization shows minimal separation. Without non-recovered patients, it's difficult to discern disease-specific trends versus inter-individual variability. Figure 6: Dramatic changes in a case with severe disseminated disease The boxplots effectively highlight how different the severe outlier patient is. This case underscores the point that systemic activation can occur. I really wonder if compared to publicly available data from people who did and did not recover after their acute infection, if you would see a lot more of this. Replicating this in a dataset with more patients with severe, non-recovering disease would be necessary to draw broader conclusions about this hyperinflammatory state. Figure 7: Skin immune responses reflect plasma protein and metabolic signatures Panel A: the source/location of ""unaffected skin"" biopsies can influence cellular profiles. This should be addressed. Panel C: The differential expression of CXCL8 (IL-8) across various skin-resident cell types is very interesting as is LILRB4 expression in skin-resident cells which would support the tissue-based regulation hypothesis as long as we had more comparators between the symptoms and inflammatory state of the individuals these cohorts. I think this paper is both very informative, and very important. However, it does need to be contextualized as a deep study of a recovering cohort, perhaps being compared to cohorts with more people who are not recovering, and that needs to be accounted for.",2025-10-08T14:25:37,michal_tal,Michal Tal,,,,

Here are our highlights: This study explores how simple molecular interactions (partial hybridization between RNA sequences) can change the course of evolution. The authors show that product inhibition, which might seem to slow things down, actually helps populations maintain diversity and obtain new adaptations FASTER. Without hybridization, the fittest sequences rapidly outcompete all others, driving the population into a low-diversity state centered on a local fitness peak. This SLOWS adaptation, because new mutations can arise only from a narrow set of closely related sequences. With hybridization, all sequences partially inhibit each other, preventing any single clone from sweeping the population. This maintains a broad pool of genetic diversity for longer periods, effectively flattening the adaptive landscape and accelerating the discovery of fitter variants. Hybridization transforms individual fitness from a fixed property into a population-dependent quantity: the reproductive success of a sequence depends on the presence and abundance of other sequences. This introduces frequency-dependent selection, reshaping the evolutionary dynamics without altering mutation rates or external conditions. In classical models, large networks of nearly neutral genotypes allow populations to drift across genotype space. Product inhibition breaks this neutrality by making fitness context dependent. Sequences that were previously neutral can become advantageous or deleterious depending on the surrounding population, creating a constantly shifting fitness landscape.",2025-10-07T13:37:08,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

Typical GWAS studies require hundreds to thousands of participants to account for confounders and small effect sizes. The GWAS-in-a-dish method used here measures each donor's proliferation/survival repeatedly over time, which removes confounders, clarifies the genetic signal, and drastically cuts the required number of participants to draw the same conclusions as a much more difficult study design.

In fact, this result is expected - when generating samples from a DDPM, a simple prior distribution is iteratively transformed to a sample from the data distribution through noisey purturbations in the direction of maximum likelihood. Consequently, it comes as no surprise that generated samples are highly similar but not exactly identical to samples from the training data. Upon additional training of a DDPM on a single dataset, one expects that these deviations should asymtotically decrease until the DDPM ‘memorizes’ the training data and generate nearly exact copies of the training data. In the context of MD, adding gaussian noise to pre-existing samples from long-time MD is generally not considered a useful enhanced sampling method, unless noise perturbed structures are subsequently evaluated with a potential energy function and are subject to some aceptance criteria, as is done in metropolis hasting / MCMC sampling methods. I do not belive that the ‘enhanced sampling’ the authors claim to obtain from over-fitting DDPMs on single MD datasets is of the same nature as that expected from standard enhaced sampling methods for MD like replica exchange or metadynamics, which aim to explore completely new regions of phase space that are otherwise difficult to access and not yet characterized. The authors present no evidence that their procedure is able to generate samples that are substantially different than those already present in the MD training data - therefore, I would not consider this an enhanced sampling method in any sense. Moreover, the DDPMs presented here are trained to maximize the likelihood of generating samples that are similar to the training data distribution - there is no incentive for the model to explore new regions of phase space and one could argue that if their model were producing samples highly dissimilar to the traing data - it would suggest that the model is either under-fit or systematically incapable of appropriately modeling the training data.",2025-10-04T19:58:19,,annonymous,,,,

I found this research paper to be interesting because a lot of previous research before has not discussed how DNA from terrestrial animals can be found in the air and this information could help with biomonitoring similar to how eDNA is utilized in aquatic settings. I understand that this type of research has never been done before and it demonstrated how this technology can detect species in zoos and demonstrates how it can serve to be useful in the biodiversity field. I do wonder since there are high levels of contamination within these air samples how reliable could the samples be? I also understand that the method of sampling each information costs a lot and I wonder how this could be accessible to various laboratories dedicated to protecting biodiversity? I’m curious to know if you were able to develop further tools to mitigate the effects of contamination within the data samples collected. I thought it was incredible that in a zoo setting the  biodiversity monitoring was able to identify specific species and the location of those species. Another question I have with this information is if you have given thought if the information could have been different if the tool was placed in a wild life setting instead of a controlled environment such as the zoo? Overall, I think this paper and the research done with various methods will help with further research as to how DNA from the air can be utilized to revolutionize biodiversity further in the future. Thank you for presenting this research.",2025-10-04T14:48:07,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,,,,

The most critical issue is the use of HEK293T embryonic kidney cells as a “normal control” for gallbladder cancer, which is biologically inappropriate and invalidates much of the comparative analysis. The reported patient validation is based on only 3–5 samples, which is statistically underpowered and cannot support strong conclusions. The claims of discovering “novel miRNAs” are based solely on in silico prediction, with no experimental validation. The central mechanistic assertion — that miR-17~92 directly targets Cdt2 — is not demonstrated with luciferase reporter assays, which are a gold-standard requirement in miRNA research. Moreover, the paper overstates therapeutic implications without any in vivo data, making such claims premature and misleading. Overall, this work reads as a descriptive sequencing dataset inflated with overstated conclusions. Without appropriate controls, larger cohorts, independent dataset validation, and rigorous mechanistic experiments, the manuscript does not meet the standards expected for credible cancer biology research.",2025-10-04T11:33:43,scarlett_johansen,scarlett johansen,,,,

The team demonstrates, for the first time, that genome language models (Evo 1 & Evo 2) can transcend protein- or circuit-level design and generate complete, viable phage genomes with evolutionary novelty. What stands out to me as someone deeply engaged in AI-driven drug discovery and computational biology is the rigorous integration of multi-layered constraints: from sequence quality, gene architecture, and tropism specificity, to evolutionary diversification. Such hierarchical filtering mirrors the multi-stage AI pipelines we build for therapeutic design, where generative creativity must always be balanced by biological feasibility. Equally impressive is the experimental validation: 16 fully functional phages synthesized from ∼300 AI-generated genomes, some with faster lysis kinetics and higher competitive fitness than the natural ΦX174. The ability of a cocktail of these phages to rapidly overcome bacterial resistance underscores how AI-guided genomic exploration can access adaptive solutions beyond natural evolution—a principle that could redefine both antimicrobial strategies and synthetic biology at large . On a broader horizon, this work offers a blueprint for steerable, constraint-driven genome design. Much like our own efforts in applying generative AI to novel small-molecule scaffolds for resistant cancer targets, this study exemplifies how language-model-based frameworks can capture the hidden rules of evolution and recompose them into functional biological systems. The implications span from phage therapy to programmable synthetic organisms. Congratulations to the authors for pushing the frontier of generative biology—this is not just phage design, but a proof-of-principle for the next era of genome-scale AI-driven engineering.",2025-09-29T13:06:57,disqus_awfLwDEvYQ,Mohd Sufiyan Khan,,,,

If we need ~200 characters for a good estimate of the relationships between 20 tips, this makes me wonder whether we should be using a 10:1 ratio as a rule of thumb.  If we’re interested in the relationships between 20 taxa, and we can only score 100 characters, my intuition says that including more taxa would still improve our estimate of the relationships between the 20 taxa of interest, even if the placement of the ‘extra’ taxa is uncertain.  I’d be interested to know whether your study has any suggestions here. I also wonder whether you tried using the Clustering Information Distance alongside the Robinson–Foulds, as the biases with the RF distance seem like they could be particularly problematic in a study such as this, where the misplacement of a single taxon could be a likely event (see Smith 2020, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa614).  On a similar vein, I wonder whether it would be more meaningful to take the mean distance between trees in the posterior distribution and the true tree, rather than selecting a single tree – there is no guarantee that the MAP tree is representative of the posterior distribution (though potentially some tree space analysis could support the assumption that it is).

If you are not yet aware of it, you may be interested in our paper from several years ago: https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(23)00244-2. Basically, although the moment-based estimates are useful (and almost mandatory for inference over non-iid samples), it is also relatively straightforward to compute the full likelihoods by quadrature. As the cells within a cell type are assumed iid here, this is more or less compatible with the framework. The low-beta regime can also be represented as a two-state model with bursty (and potentially leaky) expression in the active state, slightly more straightforward to solve numerically. For the connection to ATAC, please see https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.110.064405. The same model is straightforward to generalize to some latent regulator or a coupled series thereof (although the best way to define such coupling is still obscure). The joint modeling of these quantities is a somewhat underexplored problem. One key issue we raise in the PRE paper is that noise modeling for ATAC is unusually challenging. There are, of course, other challenges, like the slightly non-iid nature of measurements across supposedly homogeneous cells (""cell size"" effects) and the usual DNA/gene mapping issues: how should one map a peak to a particular gene? How should one represent the relationship between multiple peaks that all ostensibly control or overlap a single gene? It is exciting to see people pursuing mechanistic approaches for this  problem, and I look forward to future work.",2025-09-23T20:28:30,gennadygorin,Gennady Gorin,,,,

Would it be correct to infer from the lack of protein binder experiments in this paper that another paper is in the works that more comprehensively benchmarks RFD3’s experimental success on protein/small molecule ligand binder design? Or will these experiments be added to a later version of this paper? I’d be very interested in particular to see how binder design conditioned only on target peptide sequence works with RFD3, analogous to the DNA binder designs shown here that were conditioned only on DNA sequence.",2025-09-23T17:23:55,,RFD Enjoyer,,,,

To fully appreciate the efficiency of using ARGs alleles to predict host pathogens, I think it would be useful to add as suppl. data a table summarizing for each ARG in your database, how many allele are unique to a single pathogenic species, or shared by 2, 3, 4, and let's say 5 or more species. Indeed, when looking at the unclassified kmers from your validation test in your suppl. data, it seems that most mobile genes of public health concern are in the list (most ESBL and carbapenemases, mcr1, all tetracycline genes, etc.). Second, it is not clear, when a gene is categorized as 'Genomic origin', whether it is a mutation of an intrinsic gene or whether it is located on integrative elements ICE or IMEs. It makes a huge difference in terms of dissemination potential.",2025-09-23T07:51:08,leclercqsebastien,Leclercq Sebastien,,,,

The build-test workflow is clearly described, and the recovery of infectious particles provides a strong experimental anchor for the computational design story. This is a great demonstration of what is currently feasible for whole-genome phage engineering. However, it misses a major opportunity to contextualize the generative model performance with explicit baselines. This makes it difficult to assess whether there is a true advance due to the ability of the generative model to move in sequence space with success rates (~16/300) above alternative (lightweight) models. Moreover, the sequence space explored here appears to stay close to known natural sequences, so it is hard to appreciate how the generative model adds novelty beyond proximity to existing genomes. Side-by-side comparisons against simple alternatives (for example a consensus design, frame-preserving randomization under GC and codon constraints, ancestral reconstruction, or family statistical models such as direct coupling analysis) would clarify whether the model improves assembly success or shifts resistance outcomes. Recent studies provide useful templates for such “null model” panels, see OpenCRISPR Figure 3E ( https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12422970/), and ProGen Lysozymes Figure S10 ( https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10400306/) for evaluating LLM-generation of proteins. Including analogous baselines here, with success rates and resistance readouts reported for each, would make the impact of this contribution and generality of this approach unmistakable.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.08.674935v1#comment-6771776887,biorxivstage,1,"I am impressed by this work. I have a few comments, questions and suggestions. Although I used the imperative mood in some sentences, never feel obliged to do them. They are just some ideas. (Being a non-native speaker of English, my comments seem to sound too harsh sometimes) 1. You mentioned ""solely using data at high spatial frequencies"" and ""use data only at high spatial frequencies"". This sounds as if you did not use low frequency signals but I guess CryoSPARC's initial resolution and maximum resolution parameters only set the high resolution cutoff, not the low resolution cutoff. In other words, if you use ""Initial resolution 5 Å, maximum resolution 2.3 Å"", it uses DC to 5 Å in early iterations and gradually increases the high resolution cutoff until it reaches DC to 2.3 Å in the last iterations. Am I wrong? 2. You mentioned that ""other approaches that we and others have tried produced maps with no interpretable high resolution structural features"" and ""other parameters often converged on false minima"". Could you please describe what was tried and unsuccessful? For example, in all cases, you set ""center structures in real space OFF"". Was this essential? ""Enforce non-negativity"" was TRUE for calmodulin, FALSE for Hb-dimer and Aca2-RNA and not mentioned for iPKAc. Again, were these choices critical? You used ""a beta version of CryoSPARC v5, which has an option to apply a soft spherical mask to the ab initio volume at each iteration"". Was this new masking feature essential for success? 3. Your ""final resolution"" in the ab initio jobs (but why is it called ""maximum resolution"" for iPKAc?) is higher (i.e. numerically smaller) than the final, refined resolution. Was this necessary? What is the minimum (i.e. numerically largest) resolution necessary for success in each case? If you can solve the structure using lower resolutions for alignment, you can get reasonable resolution estimates without gold-standard (GS) splits in cisTEM's way. 4. In general, refinement fails when the starting (reference) model is too bad beyond the radius of convergence and/or when individual particles are too noisy to be aligned. Of course, these two are not independent; noisier particles can be aligned with a better reference. Regularization (e.g. using GSFSC or non-uniform refinement) and injection of prior information (e.g. Blush) improve the radius of convergence by making the energy landscape of the target function smoother. It would be interesting to see which problem (bad initial model or noisy alignment) hampered structure solution in these cases. 4.1. You briefly mentioned refinement trials using HR-HAIR maps as the initial reference. It would be interesting to do this more systematically. Take a HA-HAIR map, low pass filter it at various resolutions and perform refinement with global search. When does it succeed? Is the resolution different from the minimum resolution required for ab initio jobs (point 3 above). If they are very different, regularization by GSFSC might be too strong. Another possibility is that the loss of SNR in half 1 reference and half 2 reference relative to the full reference made alignment too hard. When GSFSC was proposed, this effect was said to be negligible (and overcome by a better regularization), but it might make a critical difference for extremely difficult cases like this. 4.2. It is also worth testing marginalization over poses. Does it help, or make it worse? 4.3. For some datasets, you used only a subset of the EMPIAR entry. This gives you a good chance to perform the test 4.1 more rigorously. Perform HA-HAIR on particles from the first X movies. Then perform refinement tests on particles from the remaining movies. If ab initio succeds but global search refinement fails with N particles, doesglobal search refinement succeed with 2N particles? If so, the SNR reduction due to GS split was the culprit. 5. Another idea to assess the resolution when the GSFSC is unavailable is as follows. Take a non-GS HR-HAIR map and low pass filter it to say 3.3 Å. Refine an atomic model against it. Calculate the map-model FSC on the original, non-low pass filtered map. Because an atomic model refined to 3.3 Å has predictive power beyond 3.3 Å, it can be used to gauge whether the map contains chemically sensible information beyond 3.3 Å. (You should first verify this strategy on maps with known GS resolution) Sorry for my lengthy and scattered comment. I am still thinking a better way to investigate this interesting observation and validate the resolution and haven't consolidated my thoughts fully. I just wrote what I have so far. I hope at least some of the above is useful for your investigation.",2025-09-22T13:17:23,disqus_2p28leFhmb,Takanori Nakane,,,,
