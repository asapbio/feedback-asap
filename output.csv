However, the 2nd step of ''Selective cell lysis'' is used from the work which is already published and has a patent approval in progress. This original work has not been cited in this pre-print. This has to be added in the original paper before publishing. It is highly important to properly cite the original paper if their method is utilized in another work.

Thank you for sharing this very interesting article. In this article, you stated that “Molecular mimicry explains portions of the multiple sclerosis auto-antibodyome”. I suggest that you should take the findings of Martins, et al. (2023) [1] into consideration. These authors pointed out that although the amount of antigenic sharing between hosts and both pathogenic and non-pathogenic parasites and bacteria is massive, molecular mimicry by itself is not a sufficient factor to disrupt intact self-tolerance mechanisms. In this context, in my recent paper ( https://www.aimspress.com/a... [2], I provided the missing link between molecular mimicry and the activation of autoimmune responses. I figured out that activation of the purinergic P2X7R expressed on regulatory T cells is potentially required for molecular mimicry to activate autoimmune responses. This occurs only after repeated or high-dose microbe infection and not after a single low-dose infection. I also presented a novel model of immune responses in mammals to foreign antigens, self-antigens and antigens with molecular mimicry. I hope that these comments will help to improve the quality of your paper. Kind regards, Djo Hasan References 1. Martins YC, Jurberg AD, Daniel-Ribeiro CT.

Breadth information is a key way of determining true positive from false positive hits in metagenomics: almost all false positives are characterized by low breadth of coverage, as in these cases, reads only mapped to a fraction of the reference. The authors should report coverage from KrakenUniq for their analyses; only counts are provided in the supplementary, but coverage values would be more informative for determining whether a microbial genome is present in a sample. For a brief discussion of this see: https://instrain.readthedoc... Further, the authors could then consider employing a minimum breadth cutoff to further separate true from false positives. Finally the authors could also consider comparing to approaches that incorporate breadth automatically, such as: https://github.com/bluenote... https://sourmash.readthedoc... https://instrain.readthedoc...",2024-05-29T13:09:14,acc_account,Alex Crits-Christoph,10.1101/2024.05.24.595788,Comprehensive analysis of microbial content in whole-genome sequencing samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas project,"Yuchen Ge, Jennifer Lu, Mahler Revsine, Daniela Puiu, Steven L.

Ethnonyms like Goths, Langobards and Frisians are political terms. They are not biological categories. Terms like ""Wielbark Goths"" (847) are entirely nonsensical. We simply don't know how the people of the Wielbark culture identified or were identified by others. Most likely they had never heard the name Goths and were not called so by outsiders. The name Goths appears only later in an entirely different region. We also don't know of the earlier ""Gutans"" had anything to do with the Wielbark-people or the later historical Goths. If you investigate the remains of a person buried in a cemetary that may have belonged to the Langobards, you still don't know how the individual identified whose DNA you extracted. Historians have been very careful to workout the problems that arise from mixing up ethnic/political terminology with archaeology.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.18.585639v1#comment-6462725756,biorxivstage,3,"I was asked to review a version of the manuscript for a journal. Below are my comments to the authors. In this manuscript Shub and colleagues present MIC, a new tool for the analysis of three-dimensional macromolecular structures obtained using x-ray diffraction or cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM). Given an atomic model featuring water molecules and/or ions, and the corresponding 3D map data, MIC automatically labels each putative water and/or ion location with a guess water or ion identity. Thanks to improvements in cryoEM instrumentation and data analysis, 3D maps can now frequently be obtained at resolutions better than 2.7Å, so that the problem of correctly labeling small map features as either water or ion presents itself more frequently to practictioners, myself included. In that context the availability of a well-characterized, open-source and highly performant classifier of ion/water density features is timely and most welcome. I found the manuscript to be well written, the description of the method and how it was tested clear (though as a non-expert I had trouble following the description of the network architecture and of the feature attribution methodology), and the results convincing. Most questions that arose as I was reading early parts of the manuscript (e.g. regarding the influence of slight errors in modeling of protein atoms on the labeling of ions/water) were answered in later parts. I only have minor feedback & suggestions for the authors and otherwise am supportive of publication. Here's the feedback I have: - lines 47-48: Perhaps... but I wonder if the authors are aware of Ravera et al (Nature, 2022)... and there may be a few other reports I'm unaware of myself... I wonder whether a radial average profile could be used as part of the fingerprint in future versions of MIC to improve the quality of the labeling by the network. Perhaps the authors could comment (in the discussion?) about whether incorporating experimental map features could be possible in future work? - lines 189-190: ""this simple metric showed statistically significant separation between test set predictions that agreed and disagreed with the deposited PBD label"": I found this sentence confusing at first, and still do to an extent. To me the syntax did not convey the meaning of the figure unambiguously. To spell it out: -- My understanding on first reading was: when a site lands near a boundary (i.e. the model is uncertain), the model's prediction tends to disagree with the deposited PDB label. Doesn't that mean that if the user gets a result that is assigned low confidence, they should actually assume that the identity assigned by MIC is wrong? That would seem to be problematic... wouldn't it? -- Having reviewed Fig 2e, I now think the text was a bit confusing. My interpretation of the figure: at low confidence scores, say around 0.5, it's only slighlty more likely than not that there's a disagreement with the PDB; this is more in line with the behavior I would have hoped for... i.e. when there's uncertainty, it's a close call - not necessarily was the wrong label given... - line 213: ""The revised overall test set accuracy following manual annotation is 83.3%"". This is impressive. How will this translate to lower-resolution structures, where there will be more error in atom positions... I am thinking back to the fact that they authors found that fingerprinting worked best when using very fine shells... Perhaps this should be discussed somewhere [I think this is touched on in the paragraph ending line 269] - line 269: Right. That touches on my earlier question. When you get to the ~3Å range, unless you happen to have your coordinating side chains modeled really well, MIC is going to be quite prone to error. [I still think this topic of accuracy as a function of resolution should be returned to in the discussion] - line 432: ""MIC achieves incredible accuracy"". Hah! I think the authors should aim for the readers to actually believe the claimed accuracy, and it is unhelpful to characterize the accuracy as ""incredible"". I found the manuscript credible overall ;) - line 495-498: ""limiting all calculated (...) to be identity agnostic"" - I don't understand this. Might be worth spelling things out for non-specialists like myself - line 512: ""non/prune-fifp"" I think should be ""non-prune/fifp"" - line 513: ""prune-eifp"" I think should be ""prune/eifp"" Alexis Rohou May 2024",2024-05-20T00:22:12,alexisrohou,Alexis Rohou,10.1101/2024.03.18.585639,Metric Ion Classification (MIC): A deep learning tool for assigning ions and waters in cryo-EM and x-ray crystallography structures,"Laura Shub, Wenjin Liu, Georgios Skiniotis, Michael J.

I would recommend that the authors do not replicate the standard adage of how we have to study this beetle because it is a pest that is difficult to control. There are piles of literature on this topic, including two comprehensive compendia by the Forest Service, dedicated to the biology and management of this species. Foresters know very well how to manage forests to avoid outbreaks of the Southern pine beetle. There is a multi-state program for monitoring the population of the species, and predicting its local outbreaks. Case in point - the beetle was pretty much eradicated from the state of Texas, which is presumably why the authors had to use material from Mississippi. Studying genetics in order to ""kill the pest"" seems mistargeted. We know nearly all bark beetle outbreaks are a symptom of excessive stand density, warming climate, or introductions of invasive species, i.e., human-caused. So justifying this great research by the need to control the insects is not very convincing. The many incredible biological features of this insect would make a much more interesting justification.",2024-05-16T13:44:41,jirihulcr,Jiri Hulcr,10.1101/2024.05.08.592785,Genome assembly of the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmerman) reveals the origins of gene content reduction in Dendroctonus,"Megan Copeland, Shelby Landa, Adekola Owoyemi, Michelle M.

Limited Sample Size: In Figure 1A-E, I noticed that only 18 out of the 54 subjects were included in the comparison of biological age versus chronological age in EL subjects. Due to the already limited nature of having a large sample size of centenarians for research studies, it may be more effective to include more participants because having a smaller sample size may limit the generalizability of findings and necessitate caution in applying results to broader populations or conclusions about aging. 2. Including more controls: In Figure 3 where the forward programming of EL-specific iPSCs into cortical neurons was analyzed, I noticed that there was no control of an established cortical neuron cell line. Including this control, would be helpful in comparing the differences and similarities between the differentiated iPSCs and the cortical neurons, and would further help to confirm the pluripotency of the iPSCs created in this experiment. 3. Inclusion of Demographic Information: Including the demographic information of centenarians or the countries from which they come from would be helpful in contextualizing the study and understanding the possible influences on biological age. Considering that factors such as, geographical location, lifestyle habits and access to healthcare can all influence the aging process, including the demographic information of participants may illustrate environmental or genetic factors that may lead to exceptional longevity. Furthermore, having iPSCs from diverse populations may lead to more robust findings in that they would better represent the genetic variation across the globe. 4. Supplemental figures: While the inclusion of the supplemental figures was interesting in seeing the different population of immune cells in centenarians, there was not sufficient information for readers to see how these immune cell populations compared to offspring or their spouses. Having a control of an offsprings’ spouse would help your audience understand how the population of immune cells in centenarians may have lead them to living a longer life, and provide a clearer picture of the role of immune cells in longevity.",2024-05-14T04:54:31,,Erick Nedd,10.1101/2024.03.12.584663,A longevity-specific bank of induced pluripotent stem cells from centenarians and their offspring,"Todd W.

Given the importance of mESC culture conditions in your analyses and possible future interpretations (at least, re endoderm), I wanted to point out that — following the practice of the lab I was working in at the time — mESCs were not grown in the classic 2i medium (2i in N2B27), but in fact in a 2i in ES+LIF medium (exact recipe in REF20's Materials & Methods > Cell culture). Based on gastruloid end-phenotype alone (of those shown in FigS1), I would guess this atypical mESCs culture medium is most closely matched by your culture condition 3 (and possibly condition 4), and that those conditions (though they were not selected for scRNAseq) are giving rise to endoderm-rich gastruloids.

The authors have designed a FRET-based assay composed of N-terminal mClover3 donor and C-terminal m-Ruby3 acceptor fluorophores separated by a linker containing the Nsp2/3 PLpro cleavage motif to measure the proteolytic activity of PLpro. From DMS data the authors infer PLpro active site mutations ablates activity. Their study also revealed residues required for cleavage of the Nsp2/3 site, identified features of substrate binding pocket and the sequence requirements of the blocking loop. The authors have given explanations for their observations in the Discussion section. Overall, the paper is supported with follow-up enzymology and crystallography experiments of key residues. The major limitation of this study is leaky expression of mutations can mask clinically relevant mutations that can arise due to viral evolution and might have the potential to evade inhibitor treatment. Study of such mutations can provide more information about the potential escape routes open to the virus to evade developing therapeutics. Moreover, incorporation of statistical analysis could strengthen the confidence in inferences drawn from the deep sequencing data and improve the quality of the manuscript. The following points can improve the quality of the manuscript: Major points 1. In Figure 1f, it is unclear that why is the PLpro activity increasing with increase in inhibitor concentration? Perhaps the Y axis is mislabeled as while inhibitor concentration is increasing, PLpro activity should decrease. However, FRET signal would increase (and maybe should be the axis label), since there will be no cleavage. 2. Line 175 – 178 - What does 0 represent in the normalized dataset? What is the rationale used for selecting minimum 10 reads in the unselected library as the read cut-off. 10 reads is pretty low cut-off. From the data, it seems the distribution tails off before cut-off chosen for the s.d.- by eye. 0.3 s.d and 20 as read cut-off might be a  better option to eliminate sequencing artifacts. 3. Line 187-190 – What is the number of reads for the mutants that showed lower activity scores? There is a possibility that due to low read cutoff, these mutants might be lying in the range with low reads in the unselected library. 4.  Line 223-224 – Authors mention they find a good correlation between activity and abundance score. Although this is noticeable from the scatter plot but supporting high-throughput data with statistical parameters like pearson correlation coefficient, a metric that provides comparison between 2 datasets will make this data reporting more quantitative and informative. 5. Line 1340- Figure 3b- What do authors mean by variants with small enough error? Please be precise. 6.  Line 315-319/ Line 1550-1556- Extended data Fig 15c – It is difficult to interpret the inference reported that is based on the data in Extended Fig 15. There is no data reported for Normalized AMC cleavage for Y268W. Interpretation can be more comprehensible by plotting a scatter plot between the Normalized Activity Fitness Scores obtained from DMS data and Normalized AMC cleavage (%). Through this plot, the reader can easily make out the outlier. 7. Line 364-367 – Authors mention “M208W strikingly increases the protein melting temperature by over 5C, indicating a substantial improvement in thermal stability. Increased stability, and thus reduced turnover in cells, may provide a mechanism to explain leaky expression in our cellular assay and increased yield of recombinant protein for E.coli expression.” Since, leaky expression is a different issue, it is confusing why will leaky expression be a plausible reason for increased stability but less activity? 8. Since Extended data Fig 11a shows that variants display substantial amount of leaky expression, how have the authors taken this information into account while inferring results from DMS activity scores, especially since they are quantifying at the RNA level and not at the DNA level? Can the activity scores obtained for the mutants be normalized to leaky expression scores in some way, for example by subtracting the scores obtained from the leaky expression dataset in order to measure the true activity of each mutant? 9. Solvents are known to affect an enzyme’s activity, selectivity and stability. In Figure 5, authors should consider and comment about the role of solvent in understanding the mechanism of Michelis-Menten kinetics of M208 variants using substrates Z-RLRGG-AMC, Ubiquitin-Rhodamine and ISG15-Rhodamine. Minor points 1. Figure numbers need to be reformatted. Figure 3 onwards they are incorrectly labelled. For eg. ‘Fig 3’ is labelled as ‘Fig 1’. 2. Line 426-429 – In Figure 3b, L and R domains of papain should be labelled or highlighted in separate colors for the ease of understanding for the reader. 3. Overall, different DMS datasets obtained from different assays in the paper have different read cut-offs such as 10, 13 and 18. A consistent statistical logic for obtaining different read cut-offs across different DMS datasets will be helpful. Also, increasing the read cut-off might improve the data quality and minimize sequencing artefacts. - Reviewed by Priyanka Bajaj and James Fraser (UCSF)",2024-05-04T01:52:43,disqus_YtOuuM3QDF,priyanka.bajaj3193@gmail.com,10.1101/2024.03.11.584210,"Mutational Profiling of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in human cells reveals requirements for function, structure, and drug escape","Xinyu Wu, Margareta Go, Julie V.

I was curious if you would be able to benchmark it more, as the benchmark presented in Fig 1C is quite limited in scope, and could be expanded. We have shared R10.4.1 data for a variety of microbes that you might be interested in benchmarking on, include some with paired PacBio data in REBASE (which is not ground truth, but a good comparision): aws s3 cp --recursive s3://cultivarium-sequencing/MICROBEMOD-DATA-NOV2023/mapped_bams/ . aws s3 cp --recursive s3://cultivarium-sequencing/MICROBEMOD-DATA-NOV2023/reference_genomes/ . aws s3 cp --recursive s3://cultivarium-sequencing/MICROBEMOD-DATA-NOV2023/pod5/ . It is also worth noting that the comparison to MicrobeMod is a bit limited due to the reason that you note here: ""The low motif recall of MicrobeMod, at high coverage and high motif occurrence settings, primarily stems from identification of similar motifs that are not identical to the benchmarking motif, e.g. SNGAm6TC instead of GAm6T"". Despite this, overall my sense is very that nanomotif's motif calling will be likely superior in many circumstances to STREME in the context of prokaryotic methylation. Probably the best way to evaluate methylation motifs would be with some manual inspection after running multiple tools (and parameters).",2024-05-02T21:22:33,acc_account,Alex Crits-Christoph,10.1101/2024.04.29.591623,Nanomotif: Identification and Exploitation of DNA Methylation Motifs in Metagenomes using Oxford Nanopore Sequencing,"Søren Heidelbach, Sebastian Mølvang Dall, Jeppe Støtt Bøjer, Jacob Nissen, Lucas N.L. van der Maas, Mantas Sereika, Rasmus H.

I particularly like the different effects of nucleotide and that ATP rather than AMP-PNP can stabilize different helicases as shown in Figure 5F.  I wonder if mixtures of ATP and smaller concentrations of AMP-PNP could let helicases work (ATP) and then trap (AMP-PNP).  Great study of so many dimensions of this assay!

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.22.586320v1#comment-6448789110,biorxivstage,0,"This manuscript explores the mechanisms involved with decreased immunity due to aging. It does this by looking at the microbiome found within mice at different ages, then looking at increased inflammation utilizing immunoassays. The results show increased innate immunity and inflammatory signals, showing that an older mice’s microbiome acts differently on the TLR signaling system. The manuscript excels on the immunological side; however, the microbiome side of the study lacks quality control and explanation. I would recommend contacting a microbiome expert to get more insight into the field, as there is much missing from this report. This review focuses on the microbiome side of the report, which has quite a few problems to work on. 1. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) details are missing, such as the primers used, the polymerase used, and the procedure used, such as the temperature, timing, number of cycles. The PCR is not repeatable based on what is said in the methods. Refer to the paper ‘The Impact of DNA Polymerase and Number of Rounds of Amplification in PCR on 16S rRNA Gene Sequence Data’ at DIO: https:// doi.org/10.1128/mSphere.001.... 2. When sequencing the PCR data, the number of reads per sample is not stated. This is important to know if the coverage of the communities is measured. The authors also do not include the observed number of taxa to compare to the Chao1 numbers to determine coverage. This is shown in Figure 1B, where the chao1 number is very low. The taxa used for this graph is not stated, leaving the reader confused if it is the number of genera, or phyla. The lower number assumes phyla, while genera is the more commonly used in the field and should be in the hundreds.  Showing the number of ASVs/OTUs in each sample is a common measure of alpha diversity. 3. The method to which the sequenced data was sorted is not given. The authors do not state if ASVs or OTU’s were utilized which leads to confusion in the way the dominant taxa were determined. It is also impossible to know if the sequenced data was corrected for 16S copy number, or for variance in genome size. Refer to ‘The Variability of the 16S rRNA Gene in Bacterial Genomes and Its Consequences for Bacterial Community Analyses’ at DIO: https://doi.org/10.1371/jou... Next are some more minor issues that can be addressed. 1. At line 340, the instrument and settings for the zirconia beads are not explained. 2. No reference is given for the CLR method at line 385. 3. In the statistical analysis, it states that data was rarefied to the minimum library size, but that size is not mentioned. 4. Figure 1A states P=0.002, however no statistical test is given to get that P. 5. Figure 1C utilizes the words upregulated and downregulated which are used with expression data. I believe this is abundance of taxonomic groups, so different word choices would be more accurate, such as more or less represented.  Further, you don’t know that age caused that, as implied by the phrase “by age.” - Timothy Tomkins, SHSU biomedical student.",2024-05-01T16:53:49,timothytomkins,Timothy Tomkins,10.1101/2024.03.22.586320,Aging amplifies a gut microbiota immunogenic signature linked to heightened inflammation,"Maria Elisa Caetano-Silva, Akriti Shrestha, Audrey F.

Here are a few ideas and questions I have that I think could possibly improve this paper: 1. Since this study focuses on N and P levels and hydrocarbon degradation, then the levels of N and P in the collected seawater need to be quantified. 2. I understand that it must not be under lab-ready circumstances to extract AND analyze the samples of the artic waters at the same exact location for a more accurate sampling of the microbiome 3. The levels in the three growth conditions of high, low, and ambient. It would be helpful to list all ingredients and their final concentrations for the three conditions as well. 4. Perhaps in the future, the use of transposons could also be used to track the genes that correlate with biodegradation of crude oil, and which strains/taxa of bacteria they originate. Making a isolated, pairwise and community could also help narrow it down. 5. PCR conditions for the V4 amplification should be described. 6.

I am a Sam Houston State University graduate student enrolled in a microbiome course, BIOL5394. My overall impression of the manuscript is that it is excellent, and the information presented is helpful for forensic science. Abstract and Introduction The introduction is very clear and to the point. Does this study consider where the individual's death occurred, indoors or outdoors? I believe the environment in which a death occurred could alter the microbial community succession and potentially influence your given results. What ethical guidelines were followed when handling the cadavers? Methods Quality control •	Need specific PCR protocol, like # cycles, temps, polymerase, etc. https://journals.asm.org/do... •	There is no mention of the correction of the 16S copy number and variances in genome size for taxa identified ASVs. https://journals.plos.org/p... •	Was coverage of communities measured and representatively sampled equally? o	Include coverage measures such as Good’s coverage or Chao1. •	Line 115 explicitly states the protocol for USA samples. What about the samples from Finland and Italy? •	Lines 113-114 mention sections of the dissected internal organs but fail to mention the specific section. Is there a measured area region that was dissected? This could help with consistency in sampling. DNA Extraction and Sequencing •	Lines 130-131 state the Greengenes database used to assign taxonomy was last updated in May 2013. More accurate identification results would come from a more recently updated 16S gene database. Statistical analyses •	Good practice to include the complete list of packages and codes used for the analysis. Results Figure 3 •	PCoA assumes normal distribution of data. Need to show normality test or use NMDS. Figure 4 •	The taxa in this figure show excessive “unknowns.” I believe updating the database could improve this. Figure 5 •	Lines 256-259 mention the findings of ASV family are in class Bacteroidia, however after reviewing I believe the correct class is Betaproteobacteria. o	Bacteroidia, Betaproteobacteria, and Clostidia are color-coded with very similar colors. Consider making the jump to the next class a bit more distinctive. Additional comments •	The article mentions the sample size was 265, but when I add up the four category sample sizes, I get a sum of 262. Is this intentional, or a typo? •	Of the 20 Finnish cadavers, why was the liver the only organ supplied? •	Overall, it was a very interesting study!",2024-04-29T15:59:37,disqus_UL51SLzfwv,Amber Gonzalez,10.1101/752576,Manner of death and demographic effects on microbial community composition in organs of the human cadaver,"Holly Lutz, Alexandria Vangelatos, Neil Gottel, Emily Speed, Antonio Osculati, Silvia Visona, Sheree J.

It gives a clear insight into the concern at hand and summarizes the key findings to show its significance. However, the research question is not clearly stated. This is something that can be elaborated on in the introductions, but it should also be stated briefly in the abstract. I understand that there is not a lot of research done on the effects of pregnancy to the female microbiota, but it is unclear as to what the research question is. This introduction gives a good background on the issue of pregnancy altering the microbiome. Below are my comments on what could be added or further explained. 1.	Are you trying to determine which organisms are lost/recovered? 2.	Is this study for a general understanding of the effects of pregnancy on women (pre/post birth)? 3.	Are you looking at a specific family of bacteria, fungi or archea that has a meaningful change during both phases (pre- and post-maturation) to see their effects? 4.	Are the women from diverse backgrounds (race)? 5.	Was this study conducted in the same location? 6.	Include more previous studies, if any, stating what others have claimed to be the reasons behind “side effects” of pregnancy 7.	Include your own claims on what you would expect and not expect to see. Figures and Tables The table heading and description are good and easy to read. However, make sure to explain all abbreviations. Table 1. 1.	What is the difference between an t-test and a Fishers exact t-test? 2.	What does SS-days mean? 3.	Also explain why each test was used for the p-value result. Figure 3. 1.	I am not sure what these diagrams represent. 2.	3B- What is a vaginal community state type? How were they classified? It is stated that software clusters them, but what are the criteria? 3.	3A- What do the colors represent? Explain the unknown portion? General comments for figures Figures captions need to be clear, like in 1C ii) the title is “Rchress.” Is that observed ASVs?  Include clear titles for your figures as well as axis labels. References to the figures from the results section show that the figures support the findings. You can include the reasoning behind choosing these graphical analyses. Methods, Materials & Analysis 1.	In your sample and collection section, it is mentioned that the participants collected their own samples. Is there a reason for this? Why did a professional, specifically a doctor, not collect the samples? Was there a way to determine that the samples were collected and stored properly? 2.	Does the study look at women across different races? Consider this please! 3.	How was Lctobacillus classified to species level using only the V4 region? That is not possible, the full 16S sequence is required. https://www.nature.com/arti... 4.	How did your account for chimeras and PCR errors before going onto further filtering steps? 5.	Further explain your controls. It was mentioned that positive and negative controls were removed, but there is no mention of their identity. 6.	What analysis was used to determine dominant and rare taxa? This was mentioned in the paper but was not included in the methods section. 7.	This study used 16S rRNA analysis to determine species present as different body sites, when the sequencing step is conducted to determine the species what the sequencing coverage is. Is it complete? In addition, how many reads per sample? a.	This was not stated at all in the paper, and it would be good to include it in the analysis portion. Results, Discussion, Conclusion In the limitations section, it is mentioned that the samples were not collected from the same women before and after pregnancy. Wouldn’t this affect the results you have presented? It is hard to say whether your results and conclusion support the claims which were made due to this aspect of sample collection. Although your results and conclusions are significant to the study, the validity is questionable.",2024-04-29T13:34:46,oyinoluwa,Oyinoluwa,10.1101/2023.08.31.555744,The Dynamics of the Female Microbiome: Unveiling Abrupt Changes of Microbial Domains across Body Sites from Preconception to Perinatal Phase,"Charlotte J Neumann, Manuela-Raluca Pausan, Victoria Haid, Eva-Christine Weiss, Vassiliki Kolovetsiou-Kreiner, Bettina Amtmann, Petra Winkler, Alexander Mahnert, Evelyn Jantscher-Krenn, Christine Moissl-Eichinger",2023-09-01

While it is commendable that such effects have been observed and quantified with apparent robustness, this aspect alone does not compensate for the overall weaknesses of the study. The significance of this autoactivation in fruit metamorphosis, as discussed, is exaggerated. Techniques such as imaging quantification and single-cell analysis are utilized, yet they seem to function more as ornamental enhancements rather than providing substantial contributions to the core narrative. For instance, the imaging quantification primarily shows proliferation within the stomatal lineages but fails to delve deeper into the overall growth mechanisms influencing fruit shape. Additionally, the single-cell analysis appears to be inadequately executed in several aspects. A thorough reporting and discussion on the robustness of observations involving transgenic lines, such as GUS reporters, inducible lines, and mutants, is sorely missing. This is crucial, especially considering the minimal phenotypical effects of the cis-regulatory element under investigation. A detailed analysis is needed to ascertain whether the observed effects are indeed significant or simply artifacts stemming from genetic background noise. Lastly, the selection analysis presented in Supplementary Figure 26 is conceptually flawed and should be reconsidered. The approach of segregating sequences with and without the binding site (BS) before analysis is fundamentally problematic. Selecting species that carry the BS and then asserting high conservation within this group compared to others is tautological and compromises the scientific integrity of the findings.",2024-04-23T12:36:47,alessandropopoli,Alessandro Popoli,10.1101/2024.02.23.581830,SHOOTMERISTEMLESS autoactivation: A prerequisite for fruit metamorphosis,"Yang Dong, Zhi-Cheng Hu, Mateusz Majda, Hao-Ran Sun, Yao Zhang, Yi-Ning Ding, Quan Yuan, Tong-Bing Su, Tian-Feng Lü, Feng Gao, Gui-Xia Xu, Richard S.
