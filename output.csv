However as a suggestion, you should expand the ADMET table as it is not covering all the ADMET properties. Also you can do metadynamics analysis of the trajectory (Free energy landscape, PCA, mode vector etc), MMGB/PBSA calculations, Network analysis of the residues, density distribution of RMSD/RMSF/RG, Binding pocket dynamics in terms of appearance/disappearance of pocket/change in pocket volume. Such kind of additional trajectory analysis will support your manuscript.

Diet-Related Metabolic Perturbations of Gut Microbial Shikimate Pathway-Tryptamine-tRNA Aminoacylation-Protein Synthesis in Human Health and Disease Abstract Human gut bacterial Na(+)-transporting NADH:ubiquinone reductase (NQR) sequence is associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, Alzheimer disease-associated sequence (ADAS) is further characterized in cultured spore-forming Clostridium sp. Tryptophan and NQR substrate ubiquinone have common precursor chorismate in microbial shikimate pathway. Tryptophan-derived tryptamine presents in human diet and gut microbiome. Tryptamine inhibits tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) with consequent neurodegeneration in cell and animal models. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase inhibition causes protein biosynthesis impairment similar to that revealed in AD. Tryptamine-induced TrpRS gene-dose reduction is associated with TrpRS protein deficiency and cell death. In animals, tryptamine treatment results in toxicity, weight gain, and prediabetes-related hypoglycemia. Sequence analysis of gut microbiome database reveals 89% to 100% ADAS nucleotide identity in American Indian (Cheyenne and Arapaho [C&A]) Oklahomans, of which ~93% being overweight or obese and 50% self-reporting type 2 diabetes (T2D). Alzheimer disease-associated sequence occurs in 10.8% of C&A vs 1.3% of healthy American population. This observation is of considerable interest because T2D links to AD and obesity. Alzheimer disease-associated sequence prevails in gut microbiome of colorectal cancer, which linked to AD. Metabolomics revealed that tryptamine, chorismate precursor quinate, and chorismate product 4-hydroxybenzoate (ubiquinone precursor) are significantly higher, while tryptophan-containing dipeptides are lower due to tRNA aminoacylation deficiency in C&A compared with non-native Oklahoman who showed no ADAS. Thus, gut microbial tryptamine overproduction correlates with ADAS occurrence. Antibiotic and diet additives induce ADAS and tryptamine. Mitogenic/cytotoxic tryptamine cause microbial and human cell death, gut dysbiosis, and consequent disruption of host-microbe homeostasis. Present analysis of 1246 participants from 17 human gut metagenomics studies revealed ADAS in cell death diseases.

I'm going to take it step by step, commenting on clarity as I read through the paper. - I stumbled a few times in the abstract.  "" A deeper sampling of individual ants from two colonies that included all available castes (pupae, larvae, workers, female and male alates), from both before and after adaptation to controlled laboratory conditions, revealed that ant microbiomes from each colony, caste, and rearing condition were typically conserved within but not between each sampling category."" What does ""deeper"" mean, is it that you sampled ants from each caste?  (the way it's phrased now, it sounds somewhat detached, like stating that the colony had castes without stating that you sampled them) So colony number, caste, and wild vs lab are sampling categories?  What would it mean ""within, but not between each sampling category""? - What kind of sequencing did you do?  I'd like to see at a glance which -omics you are doing, right at the start of the paper, because I sometimes look for papers that use a particular method. - You use ""Tenericute"" in the abstract, and ""Mollicute"" in the Importance section.  For the readers unfamiliar with the two, it might be good to disambiguate. - The Importance section is somewhat long and repeats a lot of the abstract.  What made you want to do this study?  That no one has studied this ant's microbiomes?  That the findings might extrapolate to other ants?  That you could say something about individuality and colonial organization or evolution from the members' microbiomes? - ""Honey bee queens, workers, and drones also each have unique gut microbiomes, where worker microbiomes are more diverse than those of queens and drones, possibly due to worker foraging (9).""  ""Unique"" has the connotation of being individual, rather than a group characteristic.  Would ""discrete"" be a better term?  And I'm a bit confused by ""more diverse"".  Diverse how?  Is the meaning that the range of species within the microbial community is somehow wider on the taxonomic tree?  Or something else? - But now reading that honey bees have a core microbiome that is found in all colonies and castes.  But were we not talking about ""more diverse""? - ""However, strains [...]""  just need to be a bit clearer on what are these strains of. - What makes these microbiomes ""low-diversity""? - "" the samples collected from each colony were not differentiated from each other"" is unclear.  Do you mean that the team collected ants of caste X from all 25 colonies into a single blended sample?  Try to rephrase "" Whether the 19 common bacteria found in Texas T. septentrionalis and form a conserved microbiome that is found in other geographic regions or castes is also unknown."" is unclear to me.  Maybe try to break it up into shorter sentences. - ""major driver"" might suggest causality.  I think you mean that the differences in the presence or absence of those symbionts are producing the statistical effect of seeing differences between microbiomes, is that correct? - ""Colony JKH000270 lab-maintained ants were sampled after a year and 4 months (some male alates were sampled earlier) and Colony JKH000307 lab-maintained ants were sampled after 4 months."" I'm wondering if the time factor would be important in microbiome adaptation.  If it is, can the two colonies really be compared to each other?  Would you mind adding a couple of sentences to explain the procedure? - I'm not sure I understand how pupae and ant guts and whole ants will act as confirmatory datasets.  Would you mind elaborating? - ""Reads that were not classified as belonging to the kingdom Bacteria (i.e., those identified as Archaea or Eukaryote) using the SILVA database v128 (43, 44) were removed.""  I understand that including viruses, other fungi, diatoms, etc. would change the scope of the project.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.09.243238v5#comment-5889174595,biorxivstage,2,"Overall, I love this paper.  It's an original approach, and an important topic.  The language is clear and engaging.  I do have some questions and comments that I hope might be helpful. - ""integral parts of an imperialist enterprise [20]. Imperialism granted Western scientists unprecedented access to the world, which they translated into scientific authority, power, and wealth,""  When I first read that, I  thought you meant ""power and wealth"" as in technology that spurred the Industrial Revolution.  Later on in the paper, you elaborate that it is the power of Global North academics over academics in the Global South.  I'm also thinking that maybe applied science, such as concentration of Big Pharma exploration and production would generate power and wealth today?  Later on, you write "" Implicit in this perspective is that first authorship, and authorship of publications in general, are ways to establish authority and accumulate power in knowledge production, which in itself is worth questioning. For example, how do established authorship norms promote inequity and dominance in Western science (e.g. [74])?"" Pretty much the question I had.  So, would it be possible to phrase the statement that is at the start of the paper in some way that lets me know to wait for that discussion at the end of the paper? You go on to explain:  ""The imperialistic dynamics that created the current structures of access and power within Western science between the Global North and South have also enabled Western science to assert dominance in global knowledge production [76], while erasing, appropriating, and subjugating Indigenous knowledge and authority. "" Which leads me to believe that you only meant academia power.  So, basically, I'm a bit confused by the flow.  But the ideas themselves are powerful and I'm glad to read them. - ""through foundational practices""  I understand that you mean foundational to science, not the imperialism here? - ""as expertise about the natural world continues to be disproportionately claimed by the Global North through publication practices.  Our findings serve as a case study that reflects the inequitable structures at the core of Western biodiversity science and their resulting disparities, e.g. in access, labor, collaboration, power, and designations of expertise and authority."".  To me, this is the most important statement.  And yet it's pretty far down, at the very end of the Introduction section.  On the one hand, I understand that it is the last step in a logical chain.  On the other, I would still like it to be one of the first things I see, to let me know what I'm reading towards. - ""This study shows how historical inequity continues to shape present day research practices""  I'm not sure it does?  To me, it shows the historical inequity, and it shows that inequity is still here today.  But I don't know if the paper describes the mechanism by which one generates the other.  And don't think it needs to, what the paper focuses on is far more important.  So I'd just rephrase that a bit to remove the suggestion of causality.  ""Things are bad.  Things are still bad.  We should think about that and fix it."" - ""1960"".  I'm cool with missing the years between 1950 and 1960, I just want to see a phrase acknowledging that, and saying you accounted for it in the statistics. - ""we did not include descriptions in which the species was extinct at the time of description""  Could you add a quick phrase explaining why?  As a fresh reader, I thought ""I'd feel it an honor to have a dinosaur named after me"".  And I'm genuinely curious what is the quality of that honor that makes it different from having a current species. - ""The prevalence of first authors from the Global South increases significantly toward the present (R2 = 0.143, p = 0.014), but the prevalence of first authors from the Global North remains consistent (R2 = 6.749e-5, p = 0.947) "" Is it not a zero-sum calculation?  Earlier, you make a similar statement, but without the word ""first"", so I concluded that Global South authors were being included as author lists generally grew in length.  But there can be only one first author per paper, so I'm confused by the calculation here. - In this paper, you speak of inclusion of Global South stakeholders in Western science.  You also speak of inclusion of Indigenous knowledge and worldviews in science.  So the ""The patterns of authorship we observed show that researchers from the Global South have increasing opportunities to participate in Western science""  statement feels like it's missing a piece. - ""prioritizes the Global North‚Äôs power to theorize and conceptualize [...] frames the value of people and their perspectives in terms of how they can benefit those currently in power"" and""Paradoxically, as taxonomic work has been devalued, [...] the roles of different individuals, and how different roles are supported and valued (intellectually and materially)""  Loved reading this. - ""Adhering to the fallacy of neutrality (which is in fact a non-neutral stance and one embedded in white supremacy;""  I understand that thinking one is neutral is a fallacy.  But how is it a non-neutral stance embedded in white supremacy?  Is it because privileged people have the ability to not see problems and therefore think they're being neutral?  I would want to see a bit more clarity in this phrasing.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.02.494602v1#comment-5888374621,biorxivstage,4,"The manuscript entitled ‚ÄúFeasibility of 3T layer-dependent fMRI with GE-BOLD using NORDIC and phase regression‚Äù explores whether 3T sub-millimeter MRI with 3D-EPI readouts can be a reliable tool for human layer-fMRI. The results suggest that it is indeed feasible. I find this very exciting and an impactful message to the emerging field of mesoscopic (laminar) fMRI. While most layer-fMRI studies are being conducted at one of the ‚âà 100 installed 7T, this study shows that layer-fMRI can be extended to a much larger user base of ‚âà 10.000 3T scanners installed worldwide. There are about a dozen 3T layer-fMRI studies published already (most are referenced in the manuscript). The study here stands out in the way it aims to generate voxel-wise activation scores with efficient EPI readout and produces layer profiles from small ‚Äòcolumnar‚Äô patches of the cortex. Most other previous studies used FLASH-based readouts to investigate fMRI signal mechanisms at very long TRs and/or had to collapse fMRI data from large brain areas together to generate one layer-profile. The approach presented here makes layer-fMRI at 3T more feasibly applicable for conventional neuroscience studies. It becomes apparent that the authors paid a lot of attention to high-level fMRI processing strategies and the highest possible quality of applying those. For example, the authors developed and employed a layer-fMRI quality score of inter-trial beta consistency across depth. I really like this measure on multiple levels: A) it can account for potential statistical inflation in NORDIC, B) it can provide a measure of data quality in absence of a ground truth layer profile, C) it allows comparisons across different analysis pipelines with different voxel-wise noise levels. Overall, I find the layer-profiles of the raw data quite convincing already (right panel in Fig. 3a). They are also quite reproducible across trials. While I appreciate the application of phase regression and NORDIC, these processing steps come along with some level of uncertainty and additional dependencies of their precise application setup and inherent assumptions. Thus, I admired the author's approach to show raw and filtered data next to each other. Furthermore, I appreciated the studies focus on high-quality pre-processing and acquiring a structural VASO scan to guide the alignment between BOLD-EPI and MP2RAGE data. I also appreciated the author's decision to only use half of the trials for the main analysis, while performing the ROI selection on the other half of the trials. Sacrificing half of the data to minimize the risk of circularity is an admirably choice. Especially in the tSNR limited regime of layer-fMRI. I enthusiastically encourage the publication of this manuscript. If the authors agree, I think they could improve the clarity of the manuscript by adding a few further details of acquisition and analysis. And maybe, they can also add a few additional discussion points about the generalizability of their findings. Itemized below. 1.) I find that the manuscript has a bit of a disconcerting message too. Namely, the authors find that the quantitative (beta-score) layer-profiles are substantially altered when phase-regression is combined with or without NORDIC. This means that the layer-fMRI profiles after phase-regression and after NORDIC-denoising are not reproducible across noise levels of the MRI data. The authors describe this as CNR-dependency in lines 103, 317, 348, 452, 516. This limits the generalizability of the results. It means that the profiles will not be reproducible for slightly different experimental settings (different RF coil, different flip angle, different GRAPPA factor etc.). The authors apply the phase regression for exploratory purposes. And they also show the results without phase regression. Thus, I think they provide a comprehensive and balanced overview in the current manuscript already. If the authors agree, they could add a few sentences in the discussion section about the implications of the CNR dependence for the generalizability of the results. How valuable are de-veining methods if the resulting quantitative profiles are not reproducible across different scanning and noise levels. 2.) I was a bit surprised about the choice of the excitation flip angle of 45 deg. For a 3D-EPI with a (shot-to-shot) TR of 84 ms at 3T, I would have expected the Ernst angle to be less than half of this (approx. 20 deg). All the other parameters including the flip angle of 45 deg are a perfect match with the 3T layer-fMRI Protocol that I have developed in Feb 2020: ( https://github.com/layerfMR... second protocol in pdf). So I think the authors must have used this as a start and retrospectively removed the VASO inversion pulse from the protocol for the purpose of BOLD. Though, the excitation flip angle for a BOLD fMRI time series should be differently optimized than for a VASO inversion-recovery protocol. Thus, I am afraid that the authors did not use a protocol that would have provided the best tSNR for BOLD. I do not think that this disqualifies the conclusions of the paper. I just think that the impressive results could have even been more impressive with a more appropriate excitation flip angle. Maybe the authors want to include a brief discussion about the expected effect of overflipping? E.g. There might be an advantageous effect of suppressing physiological noise of CSF (as discussed here: https://index.mirasmart.com.... Or maybe it‚Äôs just a typo? 3.) I was surprised that the analysis pipeline uses a ROI selection criteria that is based on the layer-activation. Described on line 249: :4 the peak signal in depths 0.3-0.4 should not exceed that of depths 0.6-0.8 {...}"". This has the potential to affect the resulting layer-profiles. I appreciate that the authors investigate this potential circularity in supplementary figure S3. They find that this selection criterion is not responsible for the slope modulation with phase regression, by defining the slope solely on upper layers. This solves the issue for me. Though, I am still wondering why the selection criterion was used? Is the reason related to the difficulty to isolate the Brodman area 4a from Brodman area 4p (‚Äã‚Äã https://layerfmri.com/findi... Showing the slopes of ROIs that were extracted without this criterion might have been even more convincing in proving that there are no circularity effects. 4.)

How just the shMPST could be concluded as the main enzyme playing the role in oxidative stress in glioblastama. There is clearly a possibility that shMPST knockdown decreases the tRNA thiolation levels which then leads to the effect seen here.

The advantage of the authors‚Äô plasmid shuffle experiments is that it allows the study of many mutations and variations of Abf1. The authors reveal that Abf1 possesses an essential motif (EM) as well as several contextual residues that work together to mediate Abf1‚Äôs function. Upon further investigation of compositionally and functionally similar IDR‚Äôs, the authors hypothesize that sequence specificity and chemical context in IDRs functionally overlap with each other rather than act independently, and propose a 2D model to describe the contributions of each in IDRs. The major success of this paper is in developing a model that reconciles two contributors to IDR function: sequence specificity and chemical context. The major weakness of the paper is that the model is not comprehensively backed with control experiments. The 2D landscape model presented argues that modulation of essential motifs and contextual amino acids can produce several binding modes; however, no data is presented to show that these chimeras are viable because they interact with the same factors or function in the same way that IDR2 does. Therefore, we can‚Äôt be certain if these are off-target effects or the same interactions that occur with IDR2 as put forward in the model.  In addition, we found some aspects of the organization of the paper may require more clarity. Overall, the paper reveals some of the functional determinants for Abf1‚Äôs IDR and proposes an intriguing model for the functional determinants of other IDRs, but it could be difficult for these findings to be generalized. Major points p.4: It is unclear to us why the minimal viable construct IDR2 449-662 is the background reference construct. Is it possible that IDR1 (absent in this construct) could provide unknown benefits in particular situations? For example, given the unknowns of Abf1‚Äôs interactome, is it possible that IDR1 helps to activate transcription of other genes that could rescue IDR2 mutants? Perhaps the presence of IDR1 could confer viability for IDR2 mutants that were deemed not viable in later experiments. Plasmid shuffle assays with IDR2 mutants that also have IDR1 present could be control experiments that answer this question. p.4 The constructs generated in this paper are tested for viability via plasmid shuffle assay, but there is no control experiment to ensure that these constructs are still interacting with the same partners or functioning in the same way that wildtype IDR2 does. One possible control experiment to test this could be to choose an Abf1-interacting partner based on proteomic literature on Abf1, and perform a co-immunoprecipitation/Western blot to see if the partner is still present across different IDR2 mutants. This control experiment should be done with full length Abf1, the background reference construct (with no IDR1), as well as a construct without the EM and a shuffled construct to represent the two extremes of the 2D landscape. p.5: The decision to choose the G4 motif does not have a strong justification or explanation. In figure 3F it is shown from the alignment between Abf1 and Gal4 that the region considered to have sub-homology does not overlap with the essential motif of Abf1 nor does it show similarity in its sequence. Therefore, in our view, it does not appear that Gal4 has an EM that is homologous to the EM of Abf1. Figure S1 PDF: By eye, it appears that there is large variation between the strains considered inviable ‚Äì for example, FUS_1_163_WT clone 3 on page 6 and Shuffle 3 clones 2 and 3 on page 3 are both marked as inviable yet differ in growth. It could be helpful to readers if an explanation about why a binary classification of viable vs inviable was used in this study, as opposed to a sliding scale quantification. Minor points For a future direction, after identifying the essential motif in IDR2 (EM), we think it would be compelling to go back to the orthologs initially tested to see how conserved the essential motif is evolutionarily and to see how divergent the orthologs that we‚Äôre inviable were. We also feel that this could be incorporated into the paper‚Äôs discussion. Figure 3: Panels G-K were difficult for us to understand due to the sheer number of constructs presented. To us, the contrast between sequence-specific motif and chemical context would be clearer if panels E and K were combined, perhaps with labels ‚Äúsequence specificity‚Äù and ‚Äúchemical context‚Äù below the respective constructs, to underscore the two ends of the spectrum that these panels represent and to emphasize the unexpected viability of the constructs in K. p.2-3: The hypothesis that poorly conserved IDRs may still retain functional conservation is compelling, but the proteome-wide analysis of disorder leading up to this hypothesis could be clarified in the methods section. In particular, it would be helpful to include an explanation of why and how disorder score from metapredict and predicted pLDDT were used in conjunction with each other, as opposed to using the predicted consensus disorder score from metapredict alone.

In this response to the correspondence by Hejblum et al.

We also argue that no normalization should be performed on the semi-synthetic samples. Hence, for fairer method comparison and using the updated dearseq package by Hejblum et al., we re-run the six differential expression methods (DESeq2, edgeR, limma-voom, dearseq, NOISeq, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) without normalizing the semi-synthetic samples, i.e., under the ""No normalization"" scheme in [1].

I have a question for the authors, though. It seems that the theoretical findings on section II of the manuscript might rely on the assumption that the phase relationship between the harmonics (the phi_n) can be considered as phi_n=0 (meaning that all initial phases have the same value). This assumption is implicitly made in the case N=3, and explicitly stated in the case N=infinity, but it seems that it is not clearly justified throughout the text. Thus, it could still be the case that some of the theoretical findings would only be applicable to signals with phi_n=0. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify this issue.

I had a look in our integrated dataset (10x and Smart-seq2 datasets from 3-month-old mice) and found 19 cells expressing Cnr1 (0.68% of the cells). Most of them localise to the immature lateral cell clusters (activated or not). This is strikingly similar to the numbers that you found in the rat by immunofluorescence. Also in line with your findings, the percentage of Cnr1-expressing cells does not seem to change much with age (0.63% of ependymal cells express Cnr1 in the 10x dataset from aged mice). It is difficult to tell you more about Cnr1-expressing cells because of how very rare they are. I am planning to integrate our dataset with other datasets including spinal cord ependymal cell transcriptomes as they become publicly available to increase cell numbers and get even further with the downstream analysis (e.g clustering, differential expression analysis). I will keep Cnr1-expressing cells in mind, and keep in touch! :) Thanks again for taking the time to comment on our preprint. I look forward to continuing the discussion!

Indeed, because of the century long misleading view about the nature of viruses, in which viruses have been conceptually misidentified with the virus particles and erroneously defined based on their physical, biochemical and biological properties of these particles, the hypotheses about the evolutionary origin of viruses focus on the viral particles. As eloquently described by Salvador Luria and James Darnell in their seminal book General Virology, this conceptual constraint affects in particular the reductive hypothesis: "" The strongest argument against the regressive origin of viruses from cellular parasites is the non-cellular organization of viruses. The viral capsids are morphogenetically analogous to cellular organelles made up of protein subunits, such as bacterial flagella, actin filaments, and the like, and not to cellular membranes‚Ä¶. This theory today has little to recommend it, at least in its original form"" (from Ref. 12 in the Comment above). The Fusion Hypothesis circumvents this conceptual constraint and radically changes our view about the origin of viruses as well as their evolutionary trajectories and impact on the evolution of cellular lineages. If the ancestors of Borgs were indeed symbiotic/parasitic archaeal lineages that fused with their archaeal hosts and evolved as viral lineages, then, their genes, currently assumed to have been assimilated from their host cells, derived from the genes of their archaeal ancestors. In that case, the ‚ÄúBorgs‚Äù might be in need for a name adjustment; after all, they are just viruses living in their special environment, an archaeal host cell, which in long term can sustain their reductive evolution and diversification.",2022-05-31T15:01:32,disqus_k5QlD896Ld,Claudiu Bandea,10.1101/2021.07.10.451761,Borgs are giant extrachromosomal elements with the potential to augment methane oxidation,"Basem Al-Shayeb, Marie C.

Previous work from these authors established that NGF is important for the reinnervation of injured bone tissue. Here, they explore a secondary effect of NGF on mesenchymal cell migration that appears to be mediated by NGF‚Äôs low-affinity receptor p75. Using a variety of genetic techniques, the authors demonstrate that NGF promotes stromal cell migration in vitro, and that knockout of p75 in vivo slows bone repair. Further, p75 appears to control the expression of genes associated with cell migration. Thus, in addition to its role in bone reinnervation, NGF may act via p75 to promote stromal cell migration during bone repair. Major successes: The major success of the paper is a clear and well established connection between p75-NGF signaling and an effect on mesenchymal cell migration in mice. Also established is the importance of p75 for other processes, such as NGF production in macrophages and ossification of stromal cells. Major Weaknesses: The authors do not establish whether the effects of p75 knockout are independent of other NGF signaling pathways, such as the Trk family of NGF receptors. Thus, it is difficult to determine the relative importance of p75 versus Trk signaling in many of their experiments. Impact : This paper is the first to describe the dependence of calvarial bone repair on p75 signaling. This finding could have important clinical implications for treating bone injuries. Major Points: -A description of review committees overseeing the use of human samples for the research presented in this paper should be included. -Much of the paper relies on understanding the genetic tools, particularly transgenic mouse lines. There is no explanation in the text of what many of these transgenic lines are or what the abbreviations/notation used for them mean (e.g. NgfLysM). Interpretation of the results would be made easier if the authors included one-sentence descriptions of each of these tools and the logic behind using them. The genetics should also be added to the figures when they are critical to the experiment (e.g. a diagram of how the Cre-ER system works in figure 2). -In other contexts, p75 plays a modulatory role in neurotrophin signaling through its influence on other receptor pathways (e.g. Trks). The authors did not test here whether the effects of p75 knockout were via independent functional consequences of the p75 pathway, or relied on modulatory influences over other neurotrophin receptor pathways. For example, the results shown in figure 1 could be largely the result of TrkA signaling, with only partial dependence on p75. The additional finding that p75 knockout reduces overall NGF expression by macrophages (Fig 5) also further complicates the interpretation of many of the in vivo results. To address these complications, the authors could test whether p75 deletion from stromal cells influences the function of other neurotrophin receptors. This can be accomplished by using Trk inhibitors in conjunction with the p75 knockout/knockdown (these authors have demonstrated the ability to use such tools in their previous paper). This is an important experiment because it would determine whether the influence of NGF on p75 can be studied independently of its role in promoting reinnervation via Trk signaling, or if the two phenomena are better examined in relation to each other. -The authors‚Äô should acknowledge additional caveats of their data from human cells/tissue. An important role for p75 in human cell migration is demonstrated in vitro, but it is not fully established in vivo. The observation that p75 is expressed during human bone injury does not alone indicate its function in vivo. Further, the human samples used were taken from tibia and ribs, whereas the rest of the paper is focused on calvarial bone repair. The authors should address these caveats and adjust the sentence beginning on line 261 to better reflect the full range of possibilities. -The paper emphasizes a role for p75 in cell migration. However, it is also clear that p75 likely influences a range of cellular functions beyond cell migration as well. For example,   RNA-seq experiments revealed a wide range of genes whose expression changed following p75 knockouts. Functions relating to NGF translation in macrophages were also likely impaired. These findings suggest that p75 may be critical to a broad range of cellular processes during injury repair, rather than just migration. Devoting more text to the discussion of p75‚Äôs role beyond just coordinating cell migration may broaden interest in this paper beyond its current scope. -The authors should include further details about calvarial defect procedures. Specifically, the authors should elaborate on why they choose this injury model over other available models that could recreate common fractures that skulls experience (e.g. of possible reasons: convenience for observations or less pain for animals). At a minimum, the authors should state a reason why they choose this injury model for their studies. This discussion could best fit in the Materials and Methods. Minor Points: -The number of observations appears to be underpowered for some experiments. Particularly, the results in Figs. 2K and 4C look to be trending towards significance, but include small sample sizes. A power analysis for these data, or increasing the number of observations per sample for these experiments, would strengthen the authors‚Äô interpretations of the data. -The authors state the macrophage populations show a minor shift in population distribution based on the single cell data, but their IF shows significant differences in the number of macrophages at the injury site in the p75fl/fl and p75PDGFRa mice. An explanation for this discrepancy should be included. -The data in figure 5 demonstrate that p75 knockout depletes NGF expression in macrophages. This suggests a positive feedback loop between NGF expression and NGF signaling. The authors should explore the consequences of this finding in their discussion as it may be important for considering the interaction between p75 and Trk signaling during bone repair in vivo. -The authors should consider testing tissue samples for the presence of osteoclasts, due to the hypothesis that these cells could modulate the activity of osteoblasts. Generating this data would reinforce Figure 2 and the argument that p75 deletion is driving the lack of bone repair.Alternatively, the authors could discuss how osteoclasts modulate the osteoblast activity they describe through the presented data. This topic could be addressed in the Discussion section, for example as either a study limitations or future projections of this project. -The authors  should consider generating new images for Figure 2 panel I, and see if they can observe osteoblasts in the fracture healing area, using a higher magnification. This could reinforce the comparison among the two conditions presented by demonstrating the presence and hence participation of osteoblasts in the fracture healing process. Stylistic Points: -The order of the figures is a bit confusing. The authors switch back and forth between in vitro and in vivo experiments. One possible order is: Fig 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6. -Typo on line 77: ‚Äúmicrodissection bone defect site‚Äù. -Reorganize Figures 1 H and I as Figures 1 B and C; they validate the model, and it may help readers accept the model before reporting any further data. -Each chart should have its own legend. Although the color coding is clear, this will help each graph to stand independently from each other and help readers interpret the data quickly. -Remove ‚Äúsquares‚Äù from the test in the Materials and Method section, or substitute with any possible missing symbol.

The four-gene phylogeny is robust and shows clearly that one subgenome of Zea-Tripsacum is closely related to Urelytrum and Vossia.

In response to a reviewer, we added some transcriptomes of new taxa to better represent the Ratzeburgiinae.

Doing a dimensionality reduction step on the response matrix Y before performing alignment is a great idea. We haven't tried that yet, but I suspect that alignment would work well in this case (as long as you use enough PCs). The only downside is that the second-layer GP would no longer represent a function capturing the original phenotype (e.g. gene expression) but rather a low-dimensional representation of the phenotype. So in order to model the phenotype with the aligned coordinates you would have to plug the original Y matrix back into a model with the aligned coordinates (but this wouldn't be too hard).

(2022): model mis-specification criticism overlooks sensitivity analyses and orthogonal analyses The core criticism of our study (Yap et al., 2021) made by Morton et al. was that the linear mixed model (LMM) framework we employed includes a questionable biological assumption ‚Äì that diet and the microbiome are independent. They correctly note that diet is known to influence the microbiome (David et al., 2014; Rothschild et al., 2018), and thus, as these factors are inter-related, our model may be prone to biased inference. We acknowledge these points in relation to the specific LMM (see below) on which the critique by Morton et al. is focused. However, we respectfully disagree with their conclusion that this issue invalidates the findings reported in our paper, because their critique (1) incorrectly asserts that this result formed the basis of our conclusions, and (2) it overlooks several key analyses, including extensive sensitivity analyses that were specifically performed to test this (and other) assumptions. Morton and colleagues focus on a single LMM analysis of ASD in their critique, in which we adjusted for sex, age and diet, the latter by fitting the top three principal components from PCA of the centre log ratio (clr)-transformed percent energy variables from the Australian Eating Survey (AES), a validated food frequency questionnaire. In this analysis, we found that 0% of the variance in ASD diagnosis was associated with the microbiome, irrespective of the microbiome features used to construct the correlation matrix describing the relationships between random effects (e.g., common species, rare species, common genes, rare genes) (Yap et al., 2021). As diet is correlated with the microbiome, it is possible that adjusting for diet in this analysis has removed variance in ASD diagnosis that may be attributable to the microbiome. In their critique, the authors present simulations purporting to show that this issue could lead to failure to detect even very large proportions of variance (in their example 83%) (Morton, Donovan, & Taroncher-Oldenburg, 2022). Unfortunately, they fail to mention that we also performed a LMM analysis of ASD in which we did not adjust for diet (or sex or age). If there was an effect of the microbiome on ASD that had previously been removed by adjusting for diet, then this should now be ‚Äúrevealed‚Äù (i.e., captured by the microbiome random effect). However, we found precisely the same result as in our original analysis: that is, 0% of the variance in ASD diagnosis is associated with the microbiome (Yap et al., 2021). Based upon this analysis of the available data we believe it is unlikely that our conclusions have been biased by model mis-specification. The authors also do not acknowledge that we performed LMM analyses of traits other than ASD, and whereas there was negligible signal for ASD, IQ and sleep problems, we found large and significant associations of the microbiome with age, sex and stool consistency. Our results for age (i.e., ~30% of the variance associated with common microbiome species) are particularly notable because they recapitulate the findings reported in a large (independent) sample of >30K adult stool metagenomes (Rothschild et al., 2020). Our LMM results for age, sex and stool consistency were also largely unaffected by adjusting for diet (Yap et al., 2021). These analyses, which were specifically included for the purpose of benchmarking the findings for ASD, provide further evidence that our methods are not prone to under-estimating the proportion of trait variance associated with the microbiome. It is also relevant to highlight that the directionality of the causal graphs presented by Morton et al. in Figure 1 of their article (i.e., a causal effect of both the microbiome and diet on the host phenotype) are problematic, since the variance component estimates from these models might reflect cause or consequence of the focal trait. This is because microbiome taxonomic proportions change, unlike genotypes used in analogous LMM methods for estimating heritability (which are present at birth and therefore representative of causality). To demonstrate this, take as an example our analysis in which age was the dependent variable and microbiome measures were fitted as random effects (allowing capture of their interdependence). We find roughly 30% of the variance in age is associated with common microbiome species. Clearly, the way to interpret this result is that age is causal for the variance in the microbiome, not the other way round. It is equally possible that ASD influences diet and in turn the microbiome, as opposed to the opposite view espoused by Morton et al. Indeed, the wording used in their critique (i.e., ‚ÄúA more accurate model would have assumed an architecture that explicitly incorporates the direct influence of diet on the ASD phenotype as well as an indirect influence of diet on the ASD phenotype via the microbiome‚Äù) appears not to recognise this possibility. Looking beyond the LMM analyses in our paper, Morton and colleagues also did not consider several other key sets of analyses on which are conclusions are based, including differential abundance testing using ANCOM (Analysis of Composition of Microbiomes) and extensive linear model analyses. In our ANCOM analysis of ASD, we find a single robustly associated species ( Romboutsia timonensis) when adjusting for sex, age and dietary PCs, but this same species remains the only significant finding in analyses without covariates (Yap et al., 2021). This is entirely consistent with our LMM model findings but is not what would be expected if the microbiome was associated with a high proportion of variance in ASD diagnosis. Indeed, irrespective of how the data are analysed (e.g., sibling pairs only, excluding siblings, excluding children with recent exposure to antibiotics, and others), we find negligible evidence for association of individual species with ASD (other than R. timonensis), and no support whatsoever for taxa previously reported to be associated with ASD. In our linear model analyses, we show that quantitative measures of the autism spectrum, including both psychometric measures (e.g., ADOS-2/G Restricted and Repetitive Behaviour (RRB) calibrated severity scores) and polygenic scores were associated with reduced dietary diversity (Yap et al., 2021). The most parsimonious interpretation of these findings is that RRBs, which are one of the core diagnostic signs of ASD, manifest in the form of more selective dietary preferences. Polygenic scores, as an immutable component of propensity to ASD-associated traits, are an important and novel aspect of our analysis, given they facilitate preliminary causal inference (noting that we were careful to avoid strong statements about causality in our paper). In contrast, other cross-sectional autism microbiome studies ‚Äì whose results have been prioritised by Morton et al. ‚Äì have not exploited genetic predictors for autism-related traits and so cannot distinguish between cause and consequence. Overall, using a variety of orthogonal analytical approaches, we find a strong and consistent signal that ASD (and autistic traits) is associated with reduced dietary diversity, and that diet in turn is associated with the microbiome (Yap et al., 2021). These results are consistent with existing evidence for dietary effects on the microbiome (David et al., 2014; Rothschild et al., 2018) ‚Äì as pointed out by Morton et al. ‚Äì and with prior evidence (backed by clinical and lived experience) for an association of autism with diet (Berding & Donovan, 2018). We find no direct association of ASD with the microbiome, a result to which Morton and colleagues express surprise, their argument being that if ASD is associated with diet and diet influences the microbiome, then how can there be no direct ASD-microbiome association? The answer is simply that we have a finite sample, and the effect sizes are subtle. We expect that in a larger sample we might observe a direct association, but also stronger evidence that this is due to changes in diet that are related to autistic traits. This is a considerably more intuitive and parsimonious explanation for associations of the microbiome with ASD than the idea that the microbiome contributes to autistic traits, not least because there is strong evidence that ASD is a neuro-developmental condition, and expression of established ASD genes is enriched prenatally (Satterstrom et al., 2020). In this context, it is worth emphasising that the high estimated heritability of ASD (70-80%) (Bai et al., 2019) leaves relatively little room for other putative etiological causal factors (e.g., maternal immune activation). This is especially true given de novo mutations that are known to be important in ASD (Sanders et al., 2015; Sanders et al., 2012; Satterstrom et al., 2020) largely do not contribute to heritability estimates (i.e., because they are not shared by relatives) and so must consume an additional proportion of the remaining 20-30% of variance. Morton et al.‚Äôs criticism of our study comes despite it being the largest (and therefore most statistically well-powered) to date. Our study also has the dual benefits of matching data on diet and other confounders, which are lacking in many prior studies, and deep metagenomic sequencing, compared to inferior 16S technology in most published ASD microbiome papers. We note that ours is not the first study to report negligible association of the microbiome with ASD (Gondalia et al., 2012; Son et al., 2015). We also point to a recent review in Cell on microbiome studies in animal models (including for autism) highlighting the implausibility of the high proportion of positive findings, asserting that the field suffers from publication bias (Walter, Armet, Finlay, & Shanahan, 2020). That said, we acknowledge that our study has limitations, reflecting difficulties of collecting idealised data sets. Prospective studies collecting faecal samples from infants prior to autism diagnosis are needed to further advance the field, but these are challenging both logistically and because sample size is limited by the population prevalence of ASD (~1%). To sum up, we thank Morton et al. for their comments in relation to one specific analysis in our paper. This provides us with the opportunity to clarify the detailed analyses that we performed to reach our conclusions. Unfortunately, the critique from Morton et al. (based solely on simulations) overlooks most of our results, including sensitivity analyses that directly address their criticism. The authors suggest that our data should be re-analysed. We note that our data are available by application to the Australian Autism Biobank which allows other researchers to provide objective empirical evaluation. We are committed to transparent research and provide extensive supplementary materials and publicly available code and hope others in the research community will build upon our work. Chloe X.

Takahashi, +6 authors H. Okamoto, Published 20 December 2000, BiologyBiochemical and biophysical research communications TT virus (TTV) has not yet been cultured or visualized. We attempted to recover and visualize TTV-associated particles from the serum samples and feces of infected humans. Serum samples were obtained from 7 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Three patients had a high TTV DNA titer (10(8) copies/ml), three had a low TTV DNA titer (10(2) copies/ml), and one was negative for TTV DNA. Fecal supernatant was obtained from a different TTV-infected subject. The serum samples were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and TTV DNA-rich fractions were subjected to floatation ultracentrifugation in cesium chloride. Virus-like particles, 30-32 nm in diameter, were found in the 1.31-1.33 g/cm(3) fractions from each of the three serum samples with high TTV DNA titer, but not in any fraction from the four serum samples that either were negative for TTV DNA or had low TTV DNA titer. The TTV particles formed aggregates of various sizes, and immunogold electron microscopy showed that they were bound to human immunoglobulin G. Similar virus-like particles with a diameter of 30-32 nm banding at 1.34-1.35 g/cm(3) were visualized in fecal supernatant with TTV genotype 1a by immune electron microscopy using human plasma containing TTV genotype 1a-specific antibody.",2022-05-19T12:09:27,karelmorawetz,Karel Morawetz,10.1101/2022.04.28.489885,Human anelloviruses produced by recombinant expression of synthetic genomes,"Dhananjay M.

Only about a third or less of this region is actually a steppe (the Pontic-Caspian steppe). Calling this region Eastern Europe would be more useful and in tune with geographic conventions. - what you call Eastern Europe is not generally, by itself, known as Eastern Europe, especially since the fall of the Iron Curtain. That is, Czechia, Hungary and Slovakia (often along with Poland) are nowadays more commonly described as East Central Europe. - what you call SE Central Europe is actually much of the Balkans, and thus straight up Southeastern Europe.

I enjoyed the flexible modeling framework in the two-step GP, enabling multiple responses (potentially modeled with low-rank structures). For the multi-output GP, one naive approach might be running PCA/SVD on the output matrix Y (on one of the original coordinates, perhaps with the most number of spots) to capture the most variation. I wonder if you had tried something simple like this before establishing your approach (k-NN-based response filtering combined with linear modeling with LMC) and have some insights around this topic.
