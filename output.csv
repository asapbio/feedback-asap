But based on the data presented in this preprint, can the authors really conclude that Nr5a2 protein is not required for zygotic genome activation (ZGA)? The detection of Nr5a2 protein by immunofluorescence is technically challenging. For this reason, and because Nr5a2 is maternally provided (Gassler et al., Science 2022), can the authors rule out that Nr5a2 knockout zygotes still contain maternally provided Nr5a2 protein, which is sufficient for ZGA? We recommend using our optimized protocol, with which maternally provided Nr5a2 protein can be detected in oocytes, zygotes and 2-cell embryos (Gassler et al., Science 2022) to quantify how much Nr5a2 protein is left in conditional Nr5a2 knockout embryos.

Here are some comments regarding your very speedy reply: 1. Glad to hear your repo will be made public! 2. The LINCS dataset, which includes official access instructions, is detailed in our recent paper (DOI: 10.1016/j.cels.2022.10.001) 3. We include level 3 data in that resource, but I'd advise strongly against using level 3 data. They contain unnormalized CellProfiler features that are incompatible with standard distance metrics. My assumption is that a like-to-like comparison is more suited if the full standard approaches are compared (i.e. I don't think people use the level 3 data all that often, so benchmarking against it is less valuable). I think MOAProfiler is likely to still outperform, but at a lower margin. 4. I agree that testing the generalizability is a very exciting application. I think that for my lab to use MOAProfiler, I would need to see this trade-off. Thanks again!

The observation that success and selection point to the same features is reassuring. It suggests that this population is not walking into an ecological trap, which a very interesting point. One problem with the work, though, is that an undisclosed proportion of the cavity-feature data was imputed (i.e. not actually measured in the field but inferred after the fact based on the distribution of measurements that were made - see section 2.5 of ms). Imputation may be a reasonable approach if it applies to a small enough proportion of the data. The authors should disclose that proportion, so that readers can evaluate the implications of imputation.

They use this strain to quantify the number of neurons in the major sensory appendages using an existing QUAS-CD8:GFP reporter strain. The images in the paper are beautiful and the cell counts are a valuable resource for the field. No one has attempted to do cell counts like this before, and this reagent made this possible. A few suggestions to improve the paper: 1)	The authors have not formally shown that the brp-QF2w line is in fact pan neuronal. It would require significant additional work to prove this, e.g. double label antibody staining with RNA in situ hybridization against a pan-neuronal gene to show a 1:1 correspondence. I do not suggest that they do this, but it’s important to note the caveat early in the paper that the genetic reagent is assumed to be pan neuronal because the targeted locus is a neuronal gene. 2)	Speculation on phenotypic/behavioral variability caused by variation in cell number (Line 283-299) seems premature to me. It could be variation in the expression of the driver or reporter, rather than underlying variation in the number of chemosensory neurons. More experiments would need to be done to confirm that what is seen with the genetic reagents reflects actual biological variability. I might suggest that this paragraph be toned down or removed. 3)	Figure 2E-F, Figure 3E: could the authors clarify how the data are plotted and what the sample sizes are. I have the impression that the small dots are individual experiments, but it is not clear. For transparency, it might be best to not use bar plots and instead use dot plots where all of the data points are clearly visible.

Compare for example with the cryo-EM densities of apoferritin at 1.22 Å resolution (EMD-11638), apoferritin at 1.15 Å (EMD-11668), or even the maps of Beta-gal at 1.9 Å (EMD-0153 and EMD-7770). The zoomed-in densities for aminoacids presented in Figures 2d and 3a,d seem to be missing features. --While the half-map FSC extends all the way to Nyquist at a high correlation (~0.3), it starts decreasing quite early, which looks suspicious for an allegedly very high quality map. Furthermore the model-map FSC only correlates (0.5 criterion) to ~3 Å, which is quite a difference to the half-map FSC. --All figures provided in the manuscript are of very low quality, making it difficult to read the graphs and assess the results in more detail. --The author should clarify why were external templates used for particle picking and for initializing the 3D refinement. Such a dataset should easily warrant the use of a reference determined ab initio, as well as templates generated from the own data. It should also be stated to which resolution the reference 3D map was low-pass filtered to exactly. The use of external references could be the source of overfitting (model bias). --The pixel size of the acquired micrographs, as well as the defocus range used during acquisition should be stated in the manuscript. The manuscript is missing a table summarizing the cryo-EM data collection parameters. --The atomic modelling is clearly not on par with the claimed data quality. A clashscore of 42 is abnormally high, especially for a claimed resolution of 1.1 Å. The Molprobity score of 3.32 is also an indication of wrong or incomplete modelling and refinement (for a claimed resolution of 1.1 Å). --Most importantly: the main map, half-maps and masks resulting from this study should be made available to the community on EMDB for proper assessment of the results.

Thanks for reviewing the preprint — it will definitely help to make the manuscript better and improve the science. For the minor comments, I will go through them individually and make changes as necessary to the paper before its official publication. For the major comments: - The repo will be made public soon depending on how quickly Pfizer’s IP department can review and approve it — apologies for the delays. - For the CP embeddings, we actually derived from two sources as described in Methods: - JUMP Pilot: We downloaded from the repo https://github.com/jump-cel.... To our understanding, this repo was created by the same people who made the JUMP Pilot dataset, and they provided the source and instructions for downloading the CP embeddings used in their study here: https://www.biorxiv.org/con.... If you have another source for embeddings, I’m happy to analyze them! - LINCS: We downloaded them from the repo: https://github.com/broadins.... To our understanding, this repo was created by one of the main developers and maintainers of DeepProfiler for use in benchmarking DeepProfiler against CellProfiler, so we thought that it was satisfactory but we could be mistaken! As with the JUMP Pilot, if there is a better source for embeddings, I’m also happy to analyze them if you can provide a CSV. - We purposefully chose level 3 (un-normalized) embeddings because the MP profiles are also un-normalized and we wanted to compare like to like. MP's embeddings are pulled directly from the model's hidden state without any post-processing or plate / DMSO normalization. Hence if there are better embedding sources, it would be helpful if you could provide level 3 ones. - We did not try combining datasets — that’s part of a potential future work which I anticipate would boost performance as we expose the model to more diversity. Although interesting, we saw this as out of scope for supporting the main claims of the paper. For this paper at least, we did not do a cross analysis (i.e. Model trained on A but evaluated on Dataset B). It might be an interesting supplemental analysis, but we thought that prediction on held-out compounds was sufficient to prove the point we were trying to make. Strong model generalizability to other datasets instead of generalizability to new compounds (as in the current study) will be left as a future (and very exciting!) exercise. Thanks for taking the time to review and help improve the work. I admire what your group is doing for advancing open science!

They benchmark MP against CellProfiler (the standard image-based profiling approach) and DeepProfiler (an emerging image-based profiling approach also based on deep learning) using two publicly-available datasets (JUMP-pilot and LINCS). They evaluate these approaches using precision, recall, and f1 score at k for held out MOA predictions and by comparing similarity between same-MOA and different-MOA profiles. They report an astounding 1,000% performance increase for MP over CellProfiler and DeepProfiler in grouping like MOAs. We thank the authors for posting their work as a preprint - thank you! The primary innovation in MP is the specific training approach. MP uses the same architectural backbone as DeepProfiler (EfficientNet), but trains the model directly to predict compound MOA (instead, DeepProfiler uses EfficientNet to derive representations). Additionally, MP does not perform single-cell segmentation, instead training using full field of views and a series of data augmentations. The authors use the last layer as the per-compound feature embedding in their performance benchmarks. The authors also include several convincing supplementary analyses that further support their claims. Overall, the paper presents a very interesting observation and pushes against a commonly held mindset of analyzing Cell Painting data with generalist/universal approaches. Instead, the paper suggests that fine-tuned models for specific applications are vastly superior for specifically tailored tasks. However, we have two major concerns and several relatively minor comments that the authors might clarify in order to strengthen their findings and claims. Major concerns: - Our primary concern involves publicly-available resources. Namely, the github url is not public: https://github.com/pfizer-r.... Because we were unable to access the code, we were not able to perform a detailed code review. Additionally, the authors link to the CellProfiler and DeepProfiler embeddings they used to benchmark. These embeddings were derived from https://github.com/broadins.... These are not the official LINCS and JUMP resources, and at least one of the links pointed to level 3 profiles, which are not normalized. This could at least partially explain the exceptionally poor performance for CellProfiler and DeepProfiler. - Second, the authors train two separate MP models for both datasets. Did the authors try applying a trained-MP on the alternative dataset? The authors state: “To simulate the real-world use case of identifying MOAs of unknown held-out compounds, we performed an analysis where we split the dataset by compound instead of by wells (Methods).” We imagine that analyzing future compounds using embeddings of a pre-trained MP is also a common real-world application. This analysis would also reveal the level of overfitting occurring in each independently trained dataset. Would combining datasets improve performance? Minor comments and concerns: - The authors state: “​​Although traditional computer vision techniques have proved useful, they often require much fine-tuning and require human intelligence and intuition for deciding which phenotypic features and their parameters are important to measure.” We think this is a really good point, and we are glad someone else brought up the parameters and all the fine-tuning that typically needs to happen, even for generalist approaches. - The authors state: “In contrast, deep learning has emerged as a tool for learning and encoding meaningful representations (i.e. embeddings) without requiring humans to know beforehand what features may be useful for the task of interest.” We may have missed this, but the authors might decide to mention the deep learning limitation of having unlabeled and difficult-to-interpret features. - Figure 1B needs a scale bar - The authors state: “We divided the dataset such that 60% of the wells were assigned to training, 10% to validation, and 30% to test (Methods).” What does “class-balanced the training set” mean? Is this during cross validation? The authors should clarify. - The authors state: “We also ensured each MOA’s test wells spanned multiple plates (at least seven, Figure 2D, left)”. However, Figure 2D shows that most MOAs in LINCS spanned fewer than 7 plates, what did the authors do with those? - The authors state: “We also included the negative DMSO as a class to learn but excluded it from all performance metrics because of its overrepresentation in the dataset”. It would be helpful for the authors to clarify how they handled positive controls. Also related, the authors state: “we performed four analyses to assess how well the embeddings captured MOA-specific features.” How did DMSO perform? It would be interesting to see the distribution of DMSO probabilities across classes, which could point to classes with no effect or how often DMSO features might be influenced by batch effects. - For Figure 3A, the authors should clarify that their supervised learning architecture was multi-class. This is not explicitly stated. - The authors state: “On the held-out test set, the model achieved an area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.46 (random AUPRC = 0.006) for image field classification over 176 MOA classes (Figure 3A)”. How are the authors calculating this random AUPRC? If this is theoretical, the authors should compare performance with a model trained with a randomly shuffled baseline. - Additionally, the authors state elsewhere: “it was able to correctly predict MOAs for 10.2-13.6% of the compounds in a space of 176 possible MOAs. Compared to a random baseline of 0.6%, this is a 17.9-23.9x improvement.” This begs another question of how the authors formed the baselines. Also, why did the authors choose to not include DP and CP in this eval? - The Figure 4B plate map might be wrong. There are more DMSO and what are the NAs? - How did the authors determine the categories “strongly correlated” and “weakly correlated”? At different thresholds did MP still outperform? - The authors state: “Performance varied depending upon whether we predicted MOA by the neural network’s classification output or by a compound’s latent similarity to training compound embeddings”. The authors should clarify how they determined these classification outputs and latent similarities as they are introduced. - The authors state: “(delta = 0.44 for MP, Figure 3C). For both CP and DP, the difference was smaller (delta = 0.03 for CP, 0.03 for DP).” The authors define delta in the figure legend, but this should also be clearly delineated in the methods. - We were confused by the legend in figure 4D - why are each of the models showing a different k? Is this the optimal k? MP doesn’t look optimal at k=4. - The authors state: “From a low-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (TSNE) visualization of embeddings from three example MOAs, we could see that different compounds with the same MOA were clustered together with different MOAs inhabiting different areas in latent space (Figure 3G).” How did the authors choose these three example MOAs? Why not include all of them? It would be nice to visualize all embeddings for both datasets, and the TSNE plots look a bit strange, with highly similar distances between points. - The authors state: “However, the model created embeddings that were clustered by MOA despite each MOA being represented by multiple compounds (Supplemental Figure 1).” Supplementary Figure 1 is not a specific enough reference - there are multiple panels and it is unclear which panel the reader should focus on. - The authors state: “We found minor differences in classification accuracy (0.54 vs .50) suggesting that the model was not leveraging much confounding edge-specific features for its learning” Given the number of NA’s (especially in LINCS platemap in Figure 4), normalization to remove batch effects or TSNE/UMAP to suggest no batch effects would be more convincing. - Figure 6G mentions different shapes in the legend but all look like circles in the image (they are different but it's very hard to tell). The authors also forgot to include the letter g in the figure legend. - Does supplementary figure 3 show MP embeddings? This is not explicitly stated. - Performance across MOA counts for MP is impressive! Very strong performance at low n - In the discussion, the authors state: “Second, all the analyses were performed on compounds with just one known MOA. Understanding drugs that are associated with multiple MOAs is an important task, but our study did not address this question.” The authors seem to avoid explaining this in-depth throughout the article. Why is it an important task and is their justification for not including drugs with multiple MOAs good enough? They mention that they didn’t include compounds with multiple MOAs to simplify the compound space and limit polypharmacology intricacies. Did they try to include compounds with multiple MOAs? If so, I think they should report the results. If the results are bad, then that could give insight into how we can improve performance. - In the discussion, the authors state: “Although DP is another deep learning based approach to phenotypic profiling that also uses an EfficientNet backbone architecture, we observed larger performance gains with MP.” What was the authors’ rationale for using EfficientNet? Also, “architecture” here and in other sentences appears to have a broad meaning. Could another word be substituted for greater specificity? We think it would be helpful to include a diagram of their model architecture. - The authors state: “We permuted each channel’s brightness and contrast independently by a random factor in the range of 0 to 0.30 (just for the LINCS dataset).” This seems non-traditional, the authors should provide a citation. Why not perform this in the JUMP dataset? - The authors state: “As a final training augmentation step, we performed random 90-degree rotations on each image, along with random horizontal flips.” The authors should specify how many augmentations they performed, how did this expand the dataset, were any specific augmentations particularly helpful? - The authors state: “We kept only the compound data that had no more than one known MOA according to the CLUE Connectivity Map…” How often does compound data have more than one MOA from the CLUE Connectivity Map? Would it create a significant difference in results if others were included? How was CLUE connectivity data joined with or used as a filter for JUMP1? - The authors state: “We trained for 100 epochs and selected the model that had the highest accuracy on the validation set. We used a learning rate of 0.1, a weight decay of 0.0001, a dropout rate of 0.2, a learning momentum of 0.9, a learning rate scheduler with a gamma decay of 0.1 at epoch 50 and 75, and batch size of 56 for training.” Did the authors perform any sort of hyperparameter optimization? How did they select these hyperparameters? - For their CellProfiler pipelines, the authors do not explain why they used specific modules. The pipeline utilizes various different modules that I haven’t seen in other pipelines so it would help to know what is being done if there were notes. Reviewed by: Gregory P.

I found the methods, the results and the discussion quite convincing, with just a few questions and observations: 1. I understand that you used 11 additional JEV positive locations for external validation of model performance. 8 of these locations were additional piggeries, similarly to the 54 outbreaks at piggeries that you used to train your model. However, 3 of these were positive mosquito pools, which are very different, could have been collected far away from piggeries, and could be impacted by other factors. However, you didn't mention if model performance against these 3 positive pools was different than against the other 8. Can you comment on that? I understand that these are extremely low sample sizes, but it would be interesting to know if the model predicted those mostly correctly as well. 2. On page 8-9, you describe the habitat suitability modeling for Ardeidae birds. However, I don't see a similar descripticion for the habitat suitability modeling for feral pigs. Was that done the same way? 3. I understand your description that the stacked composite of ardeid suitability as a proxy for regional species richness, but that it only describes the fundamental, not the realized niche. Does this have to do with either alpha, beta or gamma diversity? 4. You're citing a paper by Furlong et al. describing the distribution of JEV mosquito vectors based on environmental niche modeling. Would it be possible to include maps of those distributions in your inhomogeneous point process framework as another covariate? Would it further improve the fit and the performance of the models, or would it be confounded with existing covariates? 5. On line 312, you mention sentinel chicken surveillance data. Was that also included? If yes, I missed it in the methods. 6. Figure 3 seems to indicate that the model was restricted to Queesnland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Is that correct? You don't mention that is the text. 7. On page 12, you mention that the model demonstrated strong associations between JEV outbreaks and proximity to waterways. However, the methods or Table S2 does not include ""proximity to waterways"" as a specific predictor. It only includes ""distances to inland wetland and riparian wetland systems"", and ""distances to rivers and streams"". Which one of these is ""proximity to waterways""? Or is it a combination of those? 8. I find it very interesting that increased precipitation and decreased temperature associated with La Nina were both associated with increased risk in univariate models, but not after accounting for landscape structure and ardeid suitability. I do wonder if this could be because of only looking at a single season where there wasn't much variation spatially across the three states studied, since La Nina affected the entire area. I also wonder if there was collinearity between increased precipitation, decreased temperature and landscape structure and ardeid suitability, which might explain the different results in the univariate vs the multivariate models. 9. I noticed that in the multivariate models you used both Ardeid species richness as well as the square of Ardeid species richness to incorporate a non-linear response. Why did you incorporate the quadratic response for this particular predictor variable, based on what analysis? And why haven't you done the same for the other predictors? 10. I understand that the relationship between JEV risk and Ardeid species richness was non-linear, such that the highest risk was at intermediate Ardeid richness. Were there particular Ardeid species for which the suitability was high at those intermediate Ardeid richness levels particularly, or was it pretty much random, or just based on the distribution of specific species? You do mention the dilution effect in the discussion, and I understand that there is limited information on the host competence of specific Ardeid species in Australia, but it would be interesting to know if there's a consistent species assemblage predicted to correspond with the highest JEV risk. 11. I'm not sure I've seen the results for the relationship between feral pig distribution and JEV risk. I'm not seeing it in Table 1, or in the text, but I see that it had a negative univariate association with JEV risk in Table S2. However, I don't see it in Table S4. Was the decision made to remove it from the list of predictors, even from the full model? If yes, why? Thank you very much for posting such an interesting study, and I'm looking forward to seeing your answers to my questions!

He collected facts and then explored how they might relate. Having already made major additions to these facts, Noboru Sueoka (1995) considered one of Chargaff’s four “rules” – PR2 – in terms of base mutation rates and a “directional mutation pressure,” with little consideration of other facts. With more sequences available, Pflughaupt and Sahakyan (2022) have now extended Sueoka’s work in a “completely assumption free” manner. Supporting Sueoka, their study “reinstates the mutation rates as the major drivers behind the emergence of PR-2.” Furthermore, they have deduced that PR2 gained its universality very early in evolution. This accords well with prior considerations of PR2 using a fact-based approach (Forsdyke 1995). Here an important underlying fact was that effective information systems, whatever their nature, must gain error-correcting ability at an early stage. Accordingly, when seeking to explain introns, it was thought that nucleic acid sequences might contain error-correcting codes (Hamming 1980; Forsdyke 1981). However, as the facts of DNA structure expanded, a genome-wide recombination-based correction process that predicted PR2 compliancy, became more plausible. In a primordial “RNA world” (prior to duplex DNA and PR1) sequences were deemed to be enriched in stem-loop structures capable of mediating error-correction. Into these intron-like sequences, genes would later have been able to elbow their way, and base content would have approached equilibria as Chargaff’s other rules evolved (Forsdyke 2013, 2021). Since some readers of Pflughaupt and Sahakyan (2022) may also read Sueoka (1995), the authors should mention that they use the term “PR2” in the widely accepted historical sense (i.e., it was preceded by “PR1”), rather in the sense used by Sueoka. Furthermore, having downplayed Forsdyke (1995) by citing the works of Chen and Zhao (2005) and Zhang and Huang (2009), they should consider referring readers to his webpage rebuttals (see or search the Wayback Machine (archive-it.org)).

Figure 1A depicts the early to late phases of SARS-CoV-1 emergence in humans. This phylogenetic tree and subsequent analyses are based on the false premise that SARS-CoV-1 evolution in humans during the early to late phases was monophyletic. The first eleven cases of SARS-CoV were geographically dispersed across a wide area from Foshan to Dongguan in the Pearl River Delta area of southern China and occurred over a 4-month period from November 2002 to March 2003 (1, 2). None of these eleven cases were epidemiologically linked. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that SARS-CoV-1 from these human cases had a common viral ancestor from a human. Indeed, 7/11 of the early cases had documented contact with animals. Subsequent studies indicated that SARS-CoV-1 had already undergone considerable genetic diversification in animals before these first human cases were described (3-8). Genetically diverse SARS-CoV-1 has been found in civets and other animals from southern China as well as in civets from Hubei province where the city of Wuhan is located. The high genetic diversity in the early phase of the outbreak thus reflects multiple independent spillovers of divergent SARS-CoV-1 from animals sold in the wildlife trade (1, 9). This is well-established in the virology literature. The SARS-CoV-1 genetic diversity observed in the early phase of the outbreak is not as the authors imply due to rapid evolution during human-to-human transfer. Contrary to the analyses in Zhan, Deverman and Chan the early and mid-phases of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak were polyphyletic with multiple spillovers and limited expansion of several lineages that were not sustained by further human-to-human passages. This is similar to human infections by Lassa virus (LASV), a hemorrhagic fever virus that is endemic to West Africa (10). Yearly, there are thousands of independent spillovers of LASV from Mastomys natalensis and other rodent intermediates or reservoirs. In a similar manner to the early SARS-CoV-1 isolates, the high genetic diversity of LASV isolated from humans is accounted for its diversity in its rodent reservoirs (11, 12). LASV transmission chains are limited in humans and thus genetic changes occurring in humans are predominantly evolutionary dead ends as were all but one of the early to mid-phase SARS-CoV-1 lineages. Zhan, Deverman and Chan stated that, “we cannot ensure that the early-to-mid epidemic samples did not straddle deep splits in the tree.” In fact, it is abundantly clear that the SARS-CoV-1 Isolates from early cases are indeed from different parts of the SARS-CoV-1 phylogenetic tree. That which the authors present as a caveat is the true explanation for the apparent high level of genetic diversity in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak. However, contrary to the authors’ flawed interpretations the genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-1 was generated in animal intermediates and the undetermined SARS-CoV-1 reservoir prior to multiple spillovers to humans. The late phase of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak is characterized by extended monophyletic spread involving a variant of SARS-CoV-1 that had sustained a 27-nucleotide deletion in orf 8 (13). There is a known index patient, a physician from the HZS-2 Hospital of Guangzhou (14). After being exposed to SARS-CoV-1 at this hospital, he traveled to Hong Kong. During a one-night stay at Hotel ‘M’ in Hong Kong he transmitted SARS-CoV-1 to 16 other guests (15). These individuals seeded outbreaks in Hong Kong, Toronto, Singapore and Vietnam. SARS-CoV-1  continued to spread with minimal genetic variation infecting over 8000 people in 25 countries on five continents and killing at least 774 people. The late phase of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak is reminiscent of the spread of Ebola virus (EBOV), another hemorrhagic fever virus, during a typical outbreak (16, 17). EBOV is transmitted from human-to-human with higher efficiency than LASV. Once a spillover of EBOV occurs there can be spread of the virus over extended human-to human transmission chains.  The genetic diversity of EBOV is considerably less than that of LASV (11). Their comparison of the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 led the authors to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 was well adapted or pre-adapted to replicate in human cells, perhaps in a laboratory. Setting aside the naivety of this argument from a virological perspective, in fact the perceived differences in genetic stability between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are artifactual. The three-month interval used by Zhan, Deverman and Chan for calculations in Figures 1 and 2 is incorrect. The genetic diversification in animals noted above occurred over an undetermined time, but likely a period of years or longer, not months. Therefore, the substitution rates of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 calculated in Figure 1C based on a 3-month interval and the analyses in Figure 2 are not correct. An extensive analysis utilizing a more complete dataset and taking into account progenitor viruses showed that the substitution rates of SARS-CoV-1-like clade varies up to six-fold across the genome, with median rates between 4.0x10-4 and 1.9x10-3 (18). These substitution rates were slightly slower than those of the SARS-CoV-2-like clade a finding at variance with this preprint. While the diversity of SARS-CoV-1 as it spread through various farmed and wild animals is known to be extensive based on available sequences (3-8), there remain gaps in this knowledge. The full extent of SARS-CoV-1 diversity in animals that existed at the time of the human spillovers in 2003-4 remains unknown. In this regard the civet viruses SZ3 and SZ16 found at the Dongmen Market (3) are not the actual progenitors of ""Outbreak 1"" as depicted in Figure 5 of the preprint. The unknown diversity of SARS-CoV-1 in animals effectively precludes assigning any one of several known lineages of SARS-CoV-1 found across a broad geographic range in China to any of the human cases. Civets and other farmed animals in Hubei province are supplied to restaurants across China (19). There must be multiple viral progenitors for what is incorrectly referred to simply as Outbreak 1, which is a composite of multiple spillover events. The lone exception are the four cases with mild illness diagnosed between 16 December 2003 and 8 January 2004 that the authors of the preprint refer to as Outbreak 2.  These cases have definitive epidemiological links to animals sold at the Xinyuan Live Animal Market (20). The authors wrote that “… SARS-CoV-2 appeared without peer in late 2019, suggesting that there was a single introduction of the human-adapted form of the virus into the human population.”  However, Pekar and colleagues (21) provide strong evidence that there were at least two introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into humans. Two lineages designated A and B emerged via the wildlife trade in Wuhan. As was the case with the genetic divergence of early SARS-CoV-1 isolates, diversification of SARS-CoV-2 into lineages A and B occurred in animals. It is pertinent to note that the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in intermediate animals in 2019 appears to have been considerably less than the diversity of SARS-CoV-1 in wildlife in 2002-3. Since the preprint by Zhan, Deverman and Chan was posted in May 2020 it has become clear that SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect numerous other species besides humans (22).  Besides this fact and the flaws discussed above, other flaws may help to explain in part why this preprint has - to date - failed to pass peer-review. For example, the authors wrote, “The only site of notable entropy in the SARS-CoV-2 S, D614G, lies outside of the RBD and is not predicted to impact the structure or function of the protein (34).” However, the D614G mutation has a profound and important impact on the structure and function of the spike shifting it to a mostly open configuration the more effectively binds ACE-2 (23, 24). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 has displayed remarkable “entropy” with the emergence of numerous variants of concern. Despite numerous errors and flawed analyses this preprint continues to be used to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a laboratory origin. For example, the misleading quote in the first sentence above is also found in the Prologue of a mass distribution book co-written by one of the authors (Alina Chan) (25). Matt Ridley, the co-author of that book considered that this preprint was “probably a careful and reputable study.” It is not. Nevertheless, Chan and Ridley continue to promote the false premise that this preprint provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may have been pre-adapted for human transmission in a laboratory (26). The preprint by Zhan, Deverman and Chan contains numerous fundamental flaws. It should be retracted, and the authors should cease promoting the misinformation that it contains. Robert F.

It is poorly described. Petri dishes are ""placed vertically"" -- distance from the source is described but height above the floor is not. I think that by ""vertically""  the authors mean that the surface of the Petri dishes were oriented perpendicular to the floor. This is NOT an appropriate method for assessing aerosol concentrations. Collection using this method is determined by the velocity of air in close proximity to the plates and size and diffusion rates -- not concentration in the air. The apparent protection by high RH may be more an impact on diffusion than actual exposure. The authors should have used a standard method for aerosol collection (e.g., an Andersen Impactor or SKC Biosampler). Phi6 is known to be much less sensitive to UVC than coronavirus when tested in liquid. Given these methodological concerns and failure to assess whether the in-duct UVC system delivered a dose expected to be sufficient to inactivate the test organism, this preprint does not present data that support the conclusions made. The test of UVC was inadequate, poorly described, and only used the least effective type of UVC system on the market, UVC in a box rather than upper room conventional or direct far-UVC.

Cholesterol in the brain and blood are regulated separately, but influence each other. A hydrophobic statin with a high fat diet may be beneficial early on. The hydrophobic statin would cross into the brain and reduce astrocyte cholesterol and the high fat diet would compensate for some loss of cholesterol in the blood. However, in later stages when the blood brain barrier is open, cholesterol likely comes from blood. In that case, a hydrophilic statin may be better. Statins are also complicated by alterations to prenylation substrates e.g, geranylgeranyl. Prenylation works opposite cholesterol to move protein out of GM1 domains.

I want to thank you for the work that you did in this paper. We had the great opportunity to read and examine the paper in detail and we had come up with a few comments that we would like to offer! For Figure 2A, we noticed that in the UMAP data, there appears to be two separate clusters for Red Blood Cells that are far apart from one another. We were a little confused yet curious to know whether there is an explanation for such separation despite both being the same type of cells. We understand that the main focus of this UMAP was to show the presence of PGCs on embryonic day 50, but seeing the two separate clusters for Red Blood Cells, we couldn’t help but wonder whether the UMAP data were completely accurate. Nevertheless, we understood and appreciated the effort into obtaining this UMAP data showing a cluster for PGCs. For Figure 3B, we thought it would be appropriate to have some explanation within the paper or in the caption of the images to guide our attention to the significance of the brightfield images. While studying the paper, we were a little confused with what the brightfield images were trying to show except that cells aggregated together. Furthermore, since there is already a FACS data at the bottom of the brightfield images that gives readers much more useful information, we wonder whether those brightfield images could be excluded or be added as supplemental figures instead. Overall, we were still very impressed with the efficiency and the success of this induction process from iPSCs straight to cjPGCLCs without inducing into iMeLCs first. For Figure 6C, the arrow in the PCA is camouflaged by the gray background. We thought it would be more appropriate to use a different color for the arrow in order to make the figure clearer and visually appealing. In addition, both Figure 6E and 6F are a little confusing since there are so many lines jumbled together. We believe using a different visual representation may be able to clarify the significance of these two figures. Overall, this was a very impressive paper. We learned a lot and thought it definitely made a lot of significant breakthroughs in the field of generation of primordial germ cells. All the data building from figure 1 to figure 5 have a nice story and flow to it. Figure 6 and 7 disrupt the flow a little, but we understood and appreciate the effort of trying to connect the findings to human significance. Once again, thank you so much for all that work that is put into this study.

I appreciated that there were different types of evidence to support the claims being made and the experimental processes were detailed. This allowed for a good mix of qualitative and quantitative data being offered. A nice variety of visuals were also included in the figures, such as the images of mouse physiology in the extended data and the diagram of PROTOMAP DARTS in figure 2. I also liked that there were rescue of condition experiments and in general there was a considerable increase in the lifespan of male mice, meaning there is a lot of potential for future research. Finally, I did think it was extensive that two different systems of developmental model organisms were used and that these experiments took a considerable amount of time. Additionally, female mice were included in the study and all organisms were inspected daily to reduce the chance of confounding variables. I do think this paper could be made even stronger with some reorganizing and adding sections to separate the paper, ex: Introduction, Results, Discussion etc. Furthermore, some additional discussion to emphasize why this focus should be important to us would be helpful. As for statistical improvements, post-hoc tests could be added, and using power analysis or statistical tests to determine sample sizes would have been useful. Sample sizes were also really small with female mice specifically. Explaining the reason for the threshold of the False Discovery Rate would be helpful as well as including it in the figures. As for figure explanations, in terms of mitochondrial “perturbation”, additional context on if this is negative or positive change would be appreciated. In figure legends, it was hard to tell why some terminology was red and why some was black. There was a missing loading control in figure 3D and no quantification of figure 3E. Additionally, sex comparisons in mice could have been more comprehensive. Males needed their activity level measured and the analysis of both males and females for all experiments was sometimes missing. Overall however, this is a strong paper with very interesting results!

As part of the group that chose your paper to delve deeper into, I had a couple of suggestions that our class felt would make your paper even better. Firstly, while reading the paper, our class was slightly confused as to why you decided to focus only on miRNA 106b-5p, when Figure 5I showed that there was a significant decrease in glucose uptake within cells transfected with mimics of both 106b-5p and Let7g-5p. Our class felt that explaining this choice further in the paper would go a long way in understanding the role that specifically 106b-5p played. Did Let7g-5p also increase in expression at lower levels of serum vitamin D? Additionally, while the methodology of this paper was very impressive, our class found that since there were no diagrams relaying methodological information it was rather difficult to find all of the information needed to contextualize each experiment. While the text explains the connections between all of the downstream effects of Jarid2 suppression due to vitamin D deficiency, some sort of comprehensive flow-chart or diagram would be very helpful for reading while trying to understand your work.

To answer your question, in our assays, we did not observe any worm where only one of the two phasmids dye-filled. All the phasmids that we observed from both the control and our mutant worms filled with DiI. The preliminary dye-filling experiments were performed many times. The reason that we  had a low sample size was because the dye-filled worms were not analyzed with a simple dissecting scope in our experiments, as is often the convention with dye-filling assays. We were unable to analyze our dye-filled worms using a dissecting microscope because, unfortunately, our dissecting scope does not have the capability to allow us to visualize dye-filled worms. Therefore, all our images were high-resolution images that were taken with a spinning disk confocal microscope at a 60X magnification. So, we had to immobilize each worm on an agar pad prior to checking them on the scope. Due to the tediousness of this task, and since we did not observe any differences in dye-filling between our control and mutant worms in our preliminary experiments, we felt that crossing the mutation into a pan-ciliary marker strain would be a more thorough experiment to assay for cilia defects. PISA stands for ""Present in SAS-6"".

In regards to the statistical analysis of the data, if some post-HOC tests were run those results would have been nice to see. The missing loading control in figure 3d was also alarming.

Autzen. Summary Dalal et al. investigates the structural consequences that various lipid nanodisc systems have on a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) from Erwinia (ELIC). The authors solved four structures of agonist-bound ELIC reconstituted in styrene-maleic acid (SMA), circularized Spycatcher-Spytag membrane scaffold protein (spMSP), and saposin and apo-ELIC5 (a non-desensitized mutant) reconstituted in spMSP using single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The authors compare these four cryo-EM structures with previously solved nanodisc structures of the same protein(s) and find that different nanodisc systems produce different ELIC conformations. They conclude that “the nanodisc scaffold affects the structure of ELIC and this effect likely relates, in part, to nanodisc size”. They use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to further substantiate this conclusion. The aim of the study is of great relevance for the assessment of meaningfulness of cryo-EM structures of membrane proteins reconstituted in various nanodisc systems, which has become a central approach for solving many different classes of membrane proteins. This was also one of our primary motivations for discussing the manuscript in class. As such, in its current form, the manuscript is difficult to read and primarily of interest to biochemists and structural biologists specifically working on pentameric ligand-gated ion channels in vitro. The evidence that the observed structural differences of ELIC can be ascribed to the different environments is primarily based on the cryo-EM structures. As it is not entirely clear to what extent the vitrification process influences the structures of ion channels, it is relevant to further substantiate these observations with biophysical studies performed in vitro in this or later studies of ELIC to appreciate if it is a general trend or only pertains to ELIC. Below we outline some questions and comments that the authors might consider when revising the manuscript. Several of our comments are centered on the presentation of data, which are missing details if this work is to target a broader audience than the manuscript in its present form does. Comments and Questions 1)	The authors solve ELIC in SMA-stabilized discs, generated from ELIC proteoliposomes composed by POPC:POPE:POPG, starting with DDM-solubilized ELIC. A huge advantage of the SMA technology is that it can be used for detergent-free solubilization of membrane proteins in what has been coined “native nanodiscs”. We realize that the workflow taken by the authors enables better comparison between different nanodisc systems, keeping the starting material and the lipid composition constant; however, we cannot help but wonder why the authors didn’t also attempt to purify ELIC in SMA directly from E. coli membranes to address whether this part of the preparation has an effect on the conformation. Considering previous studies indicating that ELIC is dependent on its lipid composition, it is relevant to address which influence native lipids will have on the conformation downstream. Importantly, the proteoliposome approach which was used to prepare SMA-ELIC should be directly stated in the main text such that the reader immediately knows that the SMA-ELIC structure has seen detergent. 2)	In extension of the above point, we also wonder why the authors did not attempt to vary the lipid composition in the reconstituted systems to probe their influence, or at the very least included a discussion of such effects. We of course recognize that including additional structural studies would have made the study even more extensive than it already is. 3)	We find it challenging to understand exactly what the pore radii of each ELIC conformational state mean. The authors show in Figure 1 and 2 that the radius of the pore changes, but it is hard to follow what exactly this means in terms of gating. How narrow does the pore have to be for it to effectively be occluded? We assume that the central residue distances are those highlighted in Figure 1 (16’ (F247), 9’ (L240), and 2’ (Q233)), however, what is the significance of 16’, 9’ if 2’ is the gate? This is hard to follow for a non-ELIC/pLIC expert. 4)	The authors state that “The nanodisc structure for SMAELIC was too disordered to measure” (line 106). At this time, it is not possible to review the cryo-EM maps (nor the PDB modes associated with them) as these are all withheld from publication, so it is difficult to understand why it was not possible to carry out the analysis on this map following the same procedure as for the other maps as Figure 1 shows a density for the nanodisc similar to the other structures. 5)	According to Suppl. Figure 4, the sidechain of Lys?? lies outside of the shown map density. The authors should reconsider whether or not modelling the sidechains of Lys?? in the SMAELIC model is fair based on their data. 6)	The authors are quite sparse in terms of introducing the reader to their model system, ELIC. For instance: Where is it from, where is it expressed, what activates it, what is its selectivity, and how relevant are studies on ELIC(5) to pLICs from other species? An explanation of this would allow the reader to appreciate the significance of the presented findings further. 7)	In extension of the above, the agonist is not properly introduced. It is only indirectly mentioned that propylamine is the agonist in the main text. 8)	The authors use a mutated form of ELIC - ELIC5 - to represent the optimal activated conformation. The authors should explain why they can use ELIC5 as the “true” activated conformation of ELIC. 9)	The authors should provide a SEC trace of the SMA ELIC sample. This seems to be missing from Suppl. Figure 3a and b. 10)	There are two large peaks in the SEC traces of the saposin sample in Suppl. Figure 3a. We assume the peak around 15 mL is saposin alone, but this is not clear from the text. 11)	The authors should provide SDS-page gels of all their samples to showcase their purity. 12)	The authors should explain why global superposition is the best option for their structural analysis. 13)	The authors should consider stating if and how their MD simulations are limited in terms of sampling, e.g., is it enough to do single MD simulations of each system or should they have performed several runs of the same systems? 14)	Figure 7 shows that the bilayer thickness for both 9 and 11 nm nanodiscs increases at the largest distance measured from the TMDs. This trend should be explained. The language in the manuscript is good, however, there are minor details throughout that would tighten it up: 15)	The presentation of the results is somewhat confusing. For instance, in lines 73-100, the authors should clarify what findings are part of this study and what are contained in previous studies. Furthermore, a thorough introduction to the different nanodiscs and why they were selected is missing; The authors could consider including an overview of estimated sizes that different nanodisc systems typically support early on in the text. This would ease the understanding of the MD analysis later in the text, which mainly deals with the diameter of the systems, in addition to the estimated nanodisc sizes from the cryo-EM data. 16)	The reader could benefit from Figure 1 showcasing the structures solved in the current paper only, in addition to the proposed conformational states of ELIC in a schematic (Figure 4e could be included in Figure 1). 17)	It is hard to get a good overview of the main findings of the paper. One way to improve the structure of the text, the authors could consider presenting their results with more conclusive headlines. E.g., the header in line 172 (“Different nanodisc scaffolds produce a range of agonist-bound conformations”) is too general and would also be applicable to findings included in the previous paragraph and the headers in line 200 and 249 do not mention the main finding of the following paragraph. 18)	Lines 76-80 cites original literature dealing with the channel opening of ELIC, however, it is hard to follow what “greater” and “quite high” means here, particularly as the literature cited is supposedly rather quantitative, e.g., “saturating concentrations of agonist in HEK membranes has been estimated to be > 0.96”. 19)	Another statement that is diffuse and should be elaborated upon is “The measured diameter of the cryo-EM density of nanodisc scaffolds”. The criteria used for this measurement should be explained here in brief or at the very least refer to Methods. 20)	Cryo-EM should be introduced as an abbreviation when it first appears (line 32 and 46). 21)	It should be clear when the authors are referring to reviews and not primary literature (e.g., “as reviewed in”). 22)	Domain names (e.g., ECD and TMD) should be introduced early on in the figures. It is hard to follow the analysis pertaining the helices M1-M4 as it is not explicated stated anywhere that a protomer is composed by four helices. 23)	In extension of the above, in lines 210 – 214, they authors discuss the structures and the altering of “loop C” without showing the location of the named region properly. 24)	Figure 4: The agonist in gray spheres in panel a and d is not helpful for the analysis. Panels f and g seem repetitive. 25)	Coloring the sidechains of residues in Figure 2c with elements (red oxygens, blue nitrogens) would help the reader interpret this figure. 26)	The MD simulations of the bilayer system is not properly introduced in the text, nor described in enough detail in the Methods section for the reader to understand this system, which makes it hard to follow the comparisons in the text. 27)	Some of the Figure legends contains errors and should be double checked, for instance, Figure 4 shows a panel B, but its description is missing. 28)	The authors should consider stating why only spMSP1D1 was subjected to MD simulations and not the other systems. 29)	Figure 5 seems less important and could be included in Suppl. Same goes for Figure 7. 30)	Figure 7: The chosen color scheme in Figure 7b is confusing considering red and blue denotes the two systems in panel 7a and in Figure 6.",2022-12-12T07:34:34,henrietteautzen,Henriette Autzen,10.1101/2022.11.20.517256,Lipid nanodisc scaffold and size alters the structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel,"Vikram Dalal, Mark J.

The authors modelled a missense allele sas-6(L69T) that is associated with primary microcephaly. This allele did not cause embryonic lethality but did cause ciliogenesis defects. This study is an excellent example of how modelling missense patient variants can help to elucidate specific functions of these genes and better our understanding of disease mechanisms. The lack of dye filling defect caught my interest. This section is very carefully worded to state that no worms were observed “that completely excluded DiI in their phasmid neurons”. Was there a partial dye filling defect? For example, did only 1 or 2 phasmid neurons dyefill? The small sample sizes of ~25 worms suggest only one replicate was performed. It may be worth investigating further. While this does not change the findings of this paper, if more variants of sas-6 are modelled in the future dye filling is the easiest/fastest assay to screen large numbers of variants. The authors mention that the L69T mutation is located in a conserved PISA motif. I am not familiar with this motif and a brief description would help me better understand how this variant may affect protein function.",2022-12-11T10:19:44,KarenL_PhD,Karen Lange,10.1101/2022.11.25.518003,A primary microcephaly-associated sas-6 mutation perturbs centrosome duplication and ciliogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans,"Mary Bergwell, Amy Smith, Ellie Smith, Ramon Duran, Erin Haastrup, Rebekah Napier-Jameson, Carter Dierlam, Rory Seidel, William Potter, Adam Norris, Jyoti Iyer",2022-11-26

I really enjoyed your paper about alpha-ketobutyrate effects on lifespan and healthspan in C. elegans and mice. I thought the results were fascinating! I thought your experiments were well laid out and supported your claims. I also appreciated how you provided qualitative and quantitative data and included two model organisms. Here are some general comments I have about your paper. I think it could be helpful to split the paper up more by different sections, like materials and methods, discussion, etc, to make it more organized. In regards to your figures, I think it would be helpful to include the data being statistically significant and the p-value. For example, I really liked how figure 4 did this and I think it could be useful for the other figures as well. Additionally, I think it could be helpful to explain why you chose your sample sizes, such as figure 1. You suggest that you included the sample size because of previous research so it would be helpful to cite this research or even perform a power analysis to justify your sample size. I really appreciate how you included male and female mice in your study. Additionally, I appreciated how you still included female mice in your studies on healthspan even though there was not a statistically significant increase in lifespan for these mice. In regards to figure 4e, I think it would be helpful to perform this study on male mice as well. It was interesting how alpha-ketobutyrate was able to decrease the decline of motility for female mice; however, it would be interesting to investigate if these results are also applicable to male mice, as you have displayed in this study, there is a difference between male and female mice. Additionally, I noticed how male and female mice were grouped together in 4f when studying hepatology. As the other experiments separated the two by sex, I also think it would be helpful to keep them separated when studying this. I noticed how there was only one female mouse included in this study so it would be helpful to include a larger sample size if possible. Overall, I found your paper really interesting!

There are many pieces of data that will serve as very important information for this field. I greatly appreciated the abundance of figures in this paper. Each figure provided relevant information for the primary question of how vasopressin is correlated to the regulation of osmolarity. I also appreciated the use of various methods to validate results. For example, both immunofluorescence staining and western blots were conducted to give qualitative and quantitative data. With this being said, there are a few suggestions that I would like to contribute. One concern that I have in relation to Figure 3. Parts a and b of figure 3 are very well done. I appreciated that there was a quantification and statistical analysis of the protein levels found in the western blot. I realized that there was no quantification and statistical analysis that accompanied that immunofluorescence staining. This would be a beneficial addition because it would be a mathematical representation of the significance of your data. An additional concern I have is with Figure 9 and other figures counting human data. Although the understanding on how vasopressin is correlated to the regulation of osmolarity, it seems that compared with the other data provided in the paper, the human data still needs to be improved. In Figure 9, it is difficult to fully conclude that there is the localization of pre-pro-vasopressin and Rab3 but by the images provided.

We are aware that the sequence learning literature focuses on learning of new motor sequences, where learning is usually quantified by speed and accuracy. Our study does not involve such a sequence learning task. However, we think that the term “sequence of movements” is adequate for our study since participants did perform movements in sequence. We believe, that the repeated execution of the same sequences is central to the adaptation we observe. In the next version of the manuscript, we will state more explicitly how we are using the term “sequence of movements"" and how it deviates from the common understanding in sequence learning literature. 2. Yes, we treat the perpendicular error and force measure differently. A reason for not baseline correcting the force measure is that we have a lot fewer trials measuring the force as compared to the perpendicular error. The average of only two trials in the last baseline block might not adequately reflect the average prior learning performance. We will, however, perform the suggested analysis and mention it in addition to our present force measure analysis. 3. Good idea, we will include the equation of the model in the manuscript's next version. 4. Of course, we cannot conclude from a near-significant p-value that there is no effect. We agree that we should have worded the results of the mentioned comparisons more carefully and will do so in the next version of our manuscript. However, our main conclusion is evident even by just looking at the plotted data (trajectories in figure 4 or perpendicular error over time in figure 6A): clearly, a prior other arm visual or passive movement is not as effective in allowing motor adaptation as an active other arm prior movement. Whether a visual/passive prior movement still allows some adaptation and whether we have enough evidence to judge if there is a difference between the two groups is certainly questionable and should be studied further. 5. Our analysis concerning transfer of learning is arguably not ideal. The initial idea was based on our expectation that visual and passive prior movements would be similarly effective as active prior movements (with similar states after the washout period). With the limited learning occurring in the visual and passive group we think that there is not a lot one can learn from our transfer condition. Nevertheless, we decided to include it in the manuscript. What we can observe is that performance is not worse in the re-adaptation compared to the end of adaptation phase like it is in the active group. In the active group, the washout phase in between is of course a reason for the worse performance in the re-adaptation phase. This observation underlines that not a lot of learning occurred in the perceptual groups when even after a washout phase performance during re-adaptation is not worse than performance at the end of adaptation. A second (perhaps rather observational) takeaway is that it does not look like learning the active sequence (that is the prior movement and the corresponding adapted reach to the final target) was enhanced by the prior exposure of the sequence with a prior “perceptual movement”. Regardless of the precise adaptation state after the washout phase, one would have expected a steeper learning curve (and therefore a smaller overall average) in the re-adaptation phase. 6. We computed the force with the help of a function as provided by Kinarm (KINARM_add_hand_kinematics: ""The hand forces calculated here are the commanded hand forces as would have been ‘commanded’ to the KINARM robot and are based on the torques applied to the robot”). Hence, we are measuring the force that was generated by the Kinarm to make the hand of the participants stay in the force channels. In our next version of the manuscript, we will describe this measure in greater detail. Thanks for bringing this to our attention. In general, channel trials in the Exoskeleton Kinarm were indeed a challenge: making the channel walls too stiff resulted in the Kinarm vibrating. After consultation with the Kinarm team, we found settings which worked for our purpose (including choosing the direction to the left from the central target as the clamp trial direction). The trajectories in the clamp trials were generally straight, but deviations of up to ~1cm were possible. This means we are likely underestimating adaptation performance with our measure. We do not think this is problematic because this affects all groups.",2022-12-06T13:44:20,magda_gippert,Magdalena Gippert,10.1101/2022.11.22.517483,Prior movement of one arm facilitates motor adaptation in the other,"M.

Edit: There are also others that are identified in the latest TAIR public release as belonging to a transcription factor family either in the curator description or computational summary that are not present in any of the 3 mentioned lists (example: AT1G31040 - ORE15 - PLATZ TF).",2022-12-06T10:16:45,andresromanowski,Andres Romanowski,10.1101/2022.11.22.517060,Plant-TFClass: a structural classification for plant transcription factors,"Romain Blanc-Mathieu, Renaud Dumas, Laura Turchi, Jérémy Lucas, François Parcy",2022-11-24

It would be informative to know whether in the model CD8+ are accompanied by elevated immunoglobulins, and whether IgM are present along IgG. This would allow further comparison with other demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (characterized often by both IgG and IgM oligoclonal bands), and other autoimmune diseases like lupus with also IgM and IgG.",2022-12-06T01:23:16,anneboullerne,Anne Boullerne,10.1101/2022.09.30.510367,Therapeutic depletion of CD8+ T-cells prevents myelin pathology in Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy,"Pearl A.

I also think you need to soften the claim in the abstract that your approach ""exploration of all conformational space confirming the experimental data"". I strongly suspect that it is too enormous to be anywhere near fully explored even with your enhanced sampling approach. That said, I applaud the use of enhanced sampling for gas-phase proteins.",2022-12-05T13:37:18,erik_marklund,Erik Marklund,10.1101/2022.12.01.518729,Ion mobility mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics simulations unravel the conformational stability and coordination dynamics of human metallothionein-2 species,"Manuel David Peris-Díaz, Alexey Barkhanskiy, Ellen Liggett, Perdita Barran, Artur Krężel",2022-12-02
