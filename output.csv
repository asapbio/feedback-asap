I noticed that in  C-type inactivated Shaker channels,  the selectivity filter is impressively similar to that of  HCN4 channels in their non-conductive form (Saponaro et al, Mol Cell 2021,DOI:10.1016/j.molcel.2021.05.033). The comparison between   WT  and W434F mutant in Shaker highlights  the large movement of Y445 and D447 sidechains, similar to those of Y482 and R484 observed by comparing  conductive and non-conductive HCN4 SF. Further, C-type inactivated Shaker channels show two ion binding sites only and  low conductance, two typical features of HCN, as well as reduced selectivity for K over Na (Kiss et al, 1999, DOI:10.1016/S0006-3495(99)77194-8).

We had a quick look at genes in the molecular functions mentioned in your preprint and their expression seems to also be unevenly distributed in the fat body Fly Cell Atlas data. From our quick look it also seems that they are enriched in different populations of fat body cells which mostly do not overlap with the ones in which we see enriched expression of fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation genes. It is great to see that our two studies come to similar conclusions and highlights how much we still have to learn on tissue and metabolic organization. If you are interested you can have a look at your genes of interest by following the links in the “Data portals” section of the Fly Cell Atlas webpage ( https://flycellatlas.org/).,2021-09-27T15:15:22,CRfly,Carlos Ribeiro,10.1101/2021.07.04.451050,Fly Cell Atlas: a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the adult fruit fly,"Hongjie Li, Jasper Janssens, Maxime De Waegeneer, Sai Saroja Kolluru, Kristofer Davie, Vincent Gardeux, Wouter Saelens, Fabrice David, Maria Brbić, Jure Leskovec, Colleen N.

Importantly, this work adds to the growing body of evidence that nuclear capsids are largely intact (Burdick et al. 2020; Dharan et al. 2020; Selyutina et al. 2020; Zila et al. 2021; Müller et al. 2021, Li et al. 2021; and others). However, for two reasons, we respectfully disagree with the conclusion that the “…HIV-1*CA14SiR represents a substantial improvement compared to previous genetic labeling strategies (Campbell et al. 2008; Burdick et al. 2020; Zurnic Bönisch et al. 2020; Pereira et al. 2011).”  First, like HIV-1*CA14SiR, the infectivity of virus labeled with GFP-CA as we described (1:15 ratio of GFP-CA:WT Gag) was modestly reduced 2-fold (Fig. 1B in Burdick et al. 2020), indicating that the GFP-CA labeling system does not severely reduce virus infectivity compared to the HIV-1*CA14SiR system.  Second, given the “minimally invasive” strategy used to label HIV-1 CA, it was surprising that the nuclear import of capsids containing CA14SiR was severely delayed by 6-12 hours (Fig. 3; Schifferdecker et al.).  In contrast, we showed that GFP-CA labeling of virions did not affect nuclear import kinetics of capsids (Fig. 2H in Burdick et al. 2020). It is not clear why the CA14SiR labeling has such a drastic effect on nuclear import kinetics; labeling most of the CA in the capsid shell with the fluorescent dye may alter the capsid structure and stability, influencing the timing of nuclear import as well as other capsid functions, such as PF74-induced disassembly.  We believe it is important to show that the labeling method does not have a significant influence on the steps in HIV-1 replication that are being investigated.  For this reason, we showed that GFP-CA labeling of virions did not affect the timing of loss of sensitivity to capsid inhibitor PF74 (Fig. 2G), timing of reporter gene expression (Fig. S1L), sensitivity to various HIV-1 inhibitors (Fig. S1M), capsid stability (Fig. S1E-F), association of capsids with nuclear envelope (Fig. S1G), nuclear import efficiency (Fig. S1G), and binding of nuclear capsids to CPSF6 (Fig. S4H-I; all figures in Burdick et al. 2020).

In the modified FLASH-seq protocol with a UMI-containing TSO, we do use separate PCR primers! We follow the advice given by the Authors of the Smart-seq3 paper and add 0.5 uM final F-primer to outcompete the leftover (unreacted) TSO after RT, exactly for that purpose: avoid over-inflating the UMI-count. We realised also that this part is not properly described in the Methods section and that, in general, so many variations of the basic protocol create some confusion. We are finalising detailed protocols and we hope to upload them on Protocols.io in the next few weeks.

There is lots of anecdotes out there, when people turned to AlphaFold for structural info, and got gobs of disordered strings in return. Personally I compared some of the 2-3 year old models built by I-TASSER to AlphaFold output and found no discernible difference - typical homology modeling performance, none have much in looking-ahead capabilities, but at least the guys behind I-TASSER don't claim to have it. Here we have a more deliberate evaluation of the heuristic AlphaFold imbalance between physical realism and template alignment.

We would first like to note that it was a pleasure to discuss the results in this paper, which we found rather interesting, and we had a very fruitful discussion. Nevertheless, we had several questions and clarifications that we were hoping you would be able to help resolve: 1. Could you please describe a bit more in detail how exactly bouts are defined and how bursts and bouts are distinguished from one another in the processed VNR signal? Is there an interbout interval threshold set to separate bouts, for instance? If yes, what was the value used? 2. Proof of the idea of measuring conduction velocities using voltage imaging is neat. However, is there some validation of the conduction velocities, as measured by the sub-Nyquist interpolated spike timing (SNAPT) method? For instance, can you compare measurements of conduction velocity by this method with, say, measurements from dual recordings with downstream partners to compare the delay between activation of a cell and the arrival of a PSC? It is not perfect, of course, but given that actually recording from dendrites etc is so challenging in small preps like larval zebrafish, it would be a useful reference value for comparison of how accurate the SNAPT measurements are. 3. The analysis of Figure 4 involves sorting bouts as those having >50% of active V3. This is a rather arbitrary classification, especially since there aren’t too many neurons per field of view so the difference between 40% and 60% might be just one neuron or so. Why not go the other way around, and first classify bouts as strong/weak and then ask what fraction of V3s was active, across all trials, by plotting bout strength against % of V3 active as a scatter plot? Moreover, we have some concerns with the definition of bout strength. Taking the average cumulative value as the bout strength doesn’t really capture the true bout strength, in our view, since it only captures amplitude, and not so much duration. In Fig 4A (bottom), for instance, bout #2 looks much weaker than bout #7 (which is longer). Yet, their computed “bout strength” is very similar. Why not use Area Under the Curve as a proxy for bout strength? It would capture both amplitude and duration in the definition of “strength”. This analysis may not change the results or the overall story, but is a more objective way of analysing the data, we think. 4. From the representative plots shown in Fig 5C and D, it seems that when V3 neurons’ activation is turned off, the bout ends. Yet, from the earlier figures, it seems that V3 activity is sustained even after a bout ends. Is it possible with the resources available to perform acute inhibition of these neurons during a bout, to test if shutting their activity suppresses swims? It would lend support to the hypothesis that V3 activity sustains bouts? 5. The switch to free swimming with optomotor response for the experiment in Fig 6 wasn’t very clear. Moreover, we don’t agree with the interpretation of the result about bout speed modulation in Fig 6C. From the raw data points, the distributions seem largely overlapping, and the difference being detected may simply be because of the large difference in the sample sizes between the control and the ablated groups. Also, how about doing the ablation experiment using the same paradigm as in Fig 5? That way, results may be easier to compare. Furthermore, it is interesting that there is no difference in bout durations in vivo with V3 ablation, although all previous experiments suggest that one should expect a reduction in bout duration on V3 ablation. This may be because of functional compensation/adaptation because of a genetic ablation of V3 neurons from birth. Hence, it may be better to perform acute inhibition in the V3 population during free-swimming OMR, provided you have lines to do the same. Other general comments: 1. Could the legends please include all n’s, as appropriate? Some legends have it, others don’t. It would make the reading much easier. 2. Fig 1G and Supplementary Fig 3  - clarify the dorsoventral axis schematic. What does 0-1 mean - as in, which is ventral and which dorsal? I think 1 would be ventral, given that active motor interneurons seem to be positioned that way, but a clarification is needed and would make the figure easier to interpret. 3. Could you please describe the filters being used in a bit more detail, instead of simply stating “high-pass filtered”? What filter type was used (Butterworth, etc.)? What were the cutoff frequencies (sometimes time constants are mentioned, but it would be better to be consistent in the reporting of these details)? 4. In the introduction, it is stated that “adapting motor output can also happen via changes in tail amplitude or force, without substantial changes in frequency.” Recent work from our lab - Jha and Thirumalai (Current Biology, 2020) - has supported this claim, and we have also shown using whole-cell recordings that this can be explained by changes in the intrinsic properties and recruitment of primary motor neurons at lower speeds. We hope you go through our paper and find it useful, in which case a citation of our work would be much appreciated. We hope you find some of our comments useful, and we eagerly look forward to hearing back from you. Thanks in advance.

However, I have several concerns (or misunderstanding). First in the method, it is not clear how the authors measured their effects. Did they stimulate n times the TS with and without UV illumination and/or drug treatments, or only once ? In the latter case, as suggested by the use of a paired t-test, the expected variability from trial to trial may have obscured the outcome. Second, the authors are surely aware that KV4 current are strongly inactivated at rest and that the window current amounts at best 10% of the full conductance (our work (Vincent and Tell, 1997; Strube et al., 2015). In addition, the recovery tau of inactivation is about 80 ms (from 20 to 140) at -100 mV (junction potential corrected (Strube et al., 2015). This means that the full recovery needs a three times more duration. We may thus expect that Gaba Epsp may be too weak to de-inactivate sufficiently KV4 channels. On figure one, the inhibitory synaptic barrage hardly reach -5 mV for one second. Given that the resting potential is about -60 mV, the potential reached during inhibition would be -65 mV. It should come as a surprise that this tiny de- inactivation of KV4 was unseen. In addition, shifting the resting potential to more negative value would reduce the window current ((Strube et al., 2015). BTW, the authors did not observe a change in resting potential after blocking KV4 channels, arguing against a strong window current at rest. We know that EPSPs are certainly stronger at synaptic sites. According to the Nersnt’s equilibrium, the Ecl- is about – 90 mv but the amplitude of the observed EPSPs do not suggest that hyperpolarization to be such large at synaptic sites. p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 115%; background: transparent }",2021-09-17T09:57:13,disqus_XAwkux9CPS,TELL,10.1101/2021.09.14.460273,GABA and IA Independently Regulate rNST Responses to Afferent Input,"Z.

Members of the Mullins laboratory read this paper together and discussed it during a recent journal club meeting. Following the meeting, we drafted the following set of comment with the aim of helping the authors revise the work for final publication.. Briefly, this manuscript describes in vitro and live-cell experiments aimed at understanding the connection between intermediate filaments and the actin cytoskeleton. As the authors note, this is an understudied topic, with many fundamental unanswered questions. The experiments described in the paper employ a variety of approaches, including rheometry, fluorescence microscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy. The major results claimed by the authors include evidence for extensive interactions between vimentin IF and actin cytoskeletal systems in the cell periphery and effects of IF networks on actin monomer diffusion. Specific comments/concerns: 1. In the Introduction the authors state that it is “...generally thought that F-actin and VIFs form two co-existing but separate networks.” This is not an entirely fair description of the field. There is a significant body of work on interactions between intermediate filaments and elements of the actin cytoskeleton [e.g. myosin II/IF interactions described in Svitkina et al. (1996). J Cell Biol 135(4):991-1007], and how the actin cytoskeleton can regulate IF network architecture [e.g. this review by Chang and Goldman (2004). Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 5(8):601-13; and numerous research papers, including Schoumacher et al. (2010) J Cell Biol. 189(3):541-56 and Serres et al. (2020) Dev Cell. 52(2):210-222]. A more inclusive discussion of previous work on the interaction of the two cytoskeletal components would improve the presentation. 2. The title mentions the cell cortex, but there is almost no mention of the cortex per se in the Results or Discussion. 3. The figure captions should contain more experimental details. For example, captions should contain information on cell types, microscopy methods, and molecular probes (e.g. is the actin in Figure 1 phalloidin stained?). They should also contain other relevant details, such as buffer conditions, temperatures, and how many times an experiment was repeated. 4. The authors should consider combining Figure 1 and 2. It is a little unclear what is being highlighted by the arrows in Figure 1, as the two networks appear to be quite separate, even in this region of the cell. Figure 2 makes a better case for overlapping network elements. 5. In Figure 2, it is unclear whether the two networks are actually interpenetrating or simply present in different focal planes. Because the raw data includes z-stacks, it would be useful to show an XZ or YZ or 3d projection of the data. 6. Figure 2 should contain some (even rough) quantification of the percentage of observed cells that displayed such unambiguously interpenetrating networks. 7. The electron microscopy in Figure 3 is beautiful and quite convincing. The minimum distance argument, however, does not rule out the possibility that the actin and intermediate filaments are linked by plectins. The crosslinks could be present in areas where the filaments are further apart. Also, to convince the reader that they can distinguish between filaments based on width, the authors should provide a histogram of all the observed filament widths. Does the histogram show a clear bimodal distribution? 8. For Figure 4, please cite some previous studies using this indenter method and/or provide further details on the method: does it apply uniaxial or isometric stretch? Some raw images before, during, and after stretching would be more useful than the recovery plot shown in B. 9. As noted above the caption (or description) of Figures 4&5 should contain the number of biological replicates. P values calculated with n=number of cells (rather than the number of replicates) are not appropriate. We recommend simply removing the P value calculations. 10. Unfortunately, the data presented in Figure 5 are not convincing: a. Firstly, P values calculated on the number of cells instead of the number of biological replicates are artificially small and should not be reported. The trend is intriguing, but does it hold up over multiple rounds of experiment? b. Secondly, the FRAP bleaches both monomers and filaments. To look at only monomers, a method like FCS would be better. c. Instead of the curves in B, raw images would be more informative. d. When vimentin is knocked out, does the rest of the cytoskeleton change to compensate? Currently the explanation for these results is that there could be direct protein-protein interactions between Vimentin and G-actin which affect G-actin diffusion. The author favored this over the model where G-actin diffusion is limited by physical/steric obstruction of Vimentin networks. However the current data is unable to fully delineate these two models as the Y117L mutant forms a sort of intermediate filament (“intermediate” in length relative to the long filament), which intuitively could physically obstruct G-actin diffusion in an intermediate fashion (which is observed by this experiment). Perhaps using another mutant form of Vimentin that is simply unable to form any filaments but is present in cellular protrusions could help clarify the mechanism of G-actin diffusion limiting. 11. It is unclear what precisely the reader is to take away from Figure 6. The concentration of actin filaments is so high that one cannot make out individual filaments or their interactions with vimentin. It does not seem very surprising that two proteins can polymerize in the presence of one another. Is the point mainly that these two proteins can mix? Are there examples of the literature of other filament-forming protein phase separating from actin, or other conditions where this mixing doesn’t occur? A negative control would make this data more convincing.",2021-09-16T22:05:04,dychemullins,Dyche Mullins,10.1101/2021.07.29.454155,Vimentin Intermediate Filaments and Filamentous Actin Form Unexpected Interpenetrating Networks That Redefine the Cell Cortex,"Huayin Wu, Yinan Shen, Suganya Sivagurunathan, Miriam Sarah Weber, Stephen A.

In current study, using unbiased lipidomics and proteomics, the authors showed that the embryonic lethality in mice lacking the fluidity regulators Adiponectin Receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1/2) is associated with aberrant high saturation of the membrane phospholipids. Using MEFs derived from AdipoR1/2-KO embryos, human cell lines and the model organism C. elegans the authors found that, mechanistically, AdipoR1/2-derived sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signals in parallel through S1PR3-SREBP1 and PPARγ to sustain the expression of the fatty acid desaturase SCD and maintain membrane properties. They concluded that an evolutionary conserved pathway by which cells and organism maintain membrane homeostasis and adapt to a variable environment. Overall this is a very elegant, well executed and well presented study that provides novel insights on the biological effect of Sphingosine 1-Phosphate on AdipoR1 in lipid homeostasis and embryogenesis.

The topic and the questions it raises are fascinating and definitely needed to be addressed. I have few comments about method details that were absent from the manuscript, and that you may consider adding: -You refer to the original publication by Bubly et al for the breeding methods of the different selection regimes you used (which is fine), but in this publication we have no information on parameters that can influence the microbiota. For instance, you could give some details about the opportunities for microorganisms to jump from one generation to the next (only through egg chorion? Adults could defecate in the bottle for next generation? Etc.). You could also mention the food composition and if preservatives were used (they both strongly affect the microbiota) -I missed the details of the collection of your different flies. You only indicated you sampled 20 individuals in each population or each selection regime, but we do not know if those individuals were collected 1) after the stress in a “selection generation”, 2) during the “no selection” generation, or 3) after x generations bred in identical conditions. You mention “common garden” in the abstract and in the conclusion, but there is no mention of this in the methods… Also, additional parameters such as the age of the flies, time spent in the same bottle etc. do affect a lot the microbiota composition -By not eliminating parental effects (like transgenerational transmission of microbiota), one potential issue is to measure the filtering effect of the treatment directly on bacteria rather than on the fly-microtiota system (or holobiont). This is something important, weakening the ""holobiont"" aspects of your discussion, and that you should discuss in my opinion. A way to test that would have been to eliminate the microbiota of the flies, and let all lines grow with the same starting microbiota. In such case, still observing different communities would indeed indicate co-evolution at the holobiont scale. I understand these flies were collected a while ago, probably without this experiment in mind, but you have to acknowledge the limits of your experimental setup. Hope you will find my suggestions relevant. I much enjoyed reading this paper and this is why I wanted to point out some potential issues.

The manuscript could benefit from a direct comparison with published protocols and proper literature reference. Specifically: 1)     The authors claim that the culture protocol described presents “unprecedented access to peri-implantation development”. However, this protocol is not directly compared with previously published protocols(Bedzhov and Zernicka-Goetz, 2014,Cell, 156, 1032-1044) which have been used extensively to study mouse peri-implantation development. This comparison seems essential to uncover the unique characteristics and advantages of the protocol for ex-vivo embryo culture presented in this study. 2)     The authors claim that their protocol provides a unique opportunity to study the contribution of the morphogenesis of extraembryonic tissues to peri-implantation development. Yet previous studies using alternative approaches have already provided great detail about the role of extraembryonic tissue behaviour during peri-implantation development and their impact on embryonic tissues morphogenesis and embryo shape acquisition. Specifically: a)     Christodoulou et al., 2018 Nat Cell Biol 20:1278, describes ExE apical constriction and ExE invagination during egg-cylinder formation. b)     Christodoulou et al., Nat Comms 2019 10: 3557 describes the impact of ExE morphogenesis on Epiblast and Visceral endoderm positioning during egg-cylinder shape acquisition. c)     Weberling A & Zernicka-Goetz M. Cell Rep. 2021 34:10865 study reveals that ExE morphogenesis is necessary for proper epiblast morphogenesis. d)     Dokmegang et al 2021 PLoS One.16:e0254763 study uses computational modelling to show that ExE morphogenesis dictates epiblast development. e)     Ueda et al Cell Rep. 2020 31:107637 study shows that the Reichert’s membrane, produced by mTE cells, is necessary for egg-cylinder morphogenesis by protecting the embryo from intrauterine pressures. The findings of these studies are partially cited and in some cases and not cited at all in other cases (Weberling A & Zernicka-Goetz M.

The findings of these studies should be correctly referred to and discussed by the authors in the revised version of the manuscript. I hope that the authors find these comments helpful.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.05.459025v1#comment-5529147342,biorxivstage,0,"I have some concerns, both major and minor, about this manuscript. I will deal with the minor concerns first. The manuscript is not easy to read – it is not reader friendly. The text deals with a large number of sequences, derived from the authors own work and obtained from the databases. These are all referred to by their database accession numbers. So, for example, when the text refers to the virus phylogenetic tree saying “MYVMV tree (Figure 1b) produced two major branches. All the MYVMV isolates from Pakistan were clustered into clade I under branch A while the Indian isolates were grouped into both the branches.” the figure does not show this – it is just a collection of anonymous database accession numbers. To confirm what the authors claim the tree shows, the reader would need to refer to a supplementary table or the database. Things could be so much better. The manuscript quotes Brown et al. (2012) which first suggested the use of “isolate descriptors” with up-dates in Brown, J.K., Zerbini, F.M., Navas-Castillo, J., Moriones, E., Ramos-Sobrinho, R., Silva, J.F., Fiallo-Olivé, E., Briddon, R.W., Hernández-Zepeda, C., Idris, A., Malathi, V.G., Martin, D.P., Rivera-Bustamante, R., Ueda, S., Varsani, A., 2015. Revision of Begomovirus taxonomy based on pairwise sequence comparisons. Arch. Virol. 160(6), 1593-1619. So at each mention of sequence EF373060, for example, you would put “MeYVMV-Ben[IN:Bar:06](EF373060)”. This gives the reader all the information needed to know what the sequence is – so, in this case, species Mesta yellow vein mosaic virus; strain Bengal; country of origin India; place of origin Barackpore; year of isolation 2006 and the accession number. This makes it much easier for the reader. Note that similar proposals, betasatellte species and isolate descriptors, have been made for betasatellites - see here. https://talk.ictvonline .org/taxonomy/p/taxon omy-history?taxnode_id=20165 479 Note that Briddon, R.W.; Brown, J.K.; Moriones, E.; Stanley, J.; Zerbini, M.; Zhou, X.; Fauquet, C.M. Recommendations for the classification and nomenclature of the DNA-beta satellites of begomoviruses. Arch Virol. 2008, 153(4), 763-81. doi: 10.1007/s00705-007-0013-6. is somewhat out-of-date. In the list of sequences used for the analysis there is a lot of duplication. All the reference sequences (sequences denoted as NC_XXXXXX) should be deleted. These duplicate the actual sequences – so for example NC_009088 is the same as EF373060. In the introduction you say “For theses analyses, we considered all the available MYVMV and betasatellite isolates so far (isolated from mesta plants or associated with mesta plants) in GenBank including the new isolates from Bangladesh (from this study).”. This is said despite the fact that earlier you noted that a second species, Mesta yellow vein mosaic Bahraich virus, is associated with MYVMD and you then appear to include this under the name  MYVMV. Mesta yellow vein mosaic Bahraich virus is far more closely related to Cotton leaf curl Multan virus and Bhendi yellow vein mosaic virus, two other malvaceous begomoviruses, than it is to MYVMV. Also you include isolates of MYVMV not “isolated from or associated with mesta plants” – MH628534 was isolated from sunflower. So, it seems that for inclusion in your analysis it is enough for the species to have been isolated from mesta, not necessarily the isolate. Unfortunately then, in selecting betasatellites for analysis, you go against this apparent rule. You ONLY include betasatelittes actually isolated from mesta, which happens to include at least five species - Kenaf leaf curl betasatellite, Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite, Mesta yellow vein mosaic betasatellite (previously known as “Ludwigia leaf distortion betasatellite”) Tomato leaf curl Joydebpur betasatellite, and Croton yellow vein mosaic betasatellite.  However, unlike for the virus, you do not include isolates the NOT from mesta. My question is – does this haphazard selection of sequences to analyse mean that the final results tell us anything useful? Although there is no mention of it, the phylogenetic trees amount to species trees. The microsatellite analysis may be useful, once all the duplicate sequences are removed but can you take sequences from 5 betasatellite species and say anything useful about what is happening in mesta? Similarly, with 5 species and a small sample set, is there anything useful to be gained from a comparison of genetic diversity in Pakistan India and Bangladesh. One interesting finding overlooked by the authors is that all the betasatellites they sequenced are isolates of Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellte. This gives strong support to the idea that, at least in Bangladesh, mesta yellow vein mosaic disease is caused by the complex Mesta yellow vein mosaic virus and Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellte.",2021-09-10T08:09:18,robertbriddon,Robert Briddon,10.1101/2021.09.05.459025,Molecular evolution and genetic analysis of Mesta yellow vein mosaic virus and associated betasatellites,"Rasel Ahmed, Rajnee Hasan, Md.

I was wondering if you did consider the possibility that sanchytrids are actually branching inside Blastocladiomycota. There is no transcriptomic/phylogenomic data available yet for any member of the shorter-branched Physodermatales. Therefore there is a possibility that they would turn out to be basal to Blastocladiales + sanchytrids, making it premature to create a new phylum for sanchytrids. Also there is very strong support for Blastocladiales + sanchytrids in the tree (the internal branch is actually longer than that at the base of Chytridiomycota, Zoopagomycota and Mucroromycota). So to be phylogenetically consistent across Fungi, one could argue that either the latter three should become multiple phyla, or Blastocladiales + sanchytrids should be in a single phylum, irrespective of the latter's unique traits. In any case, whether sanchytrids deserve to be a separate phylum or not, the very strong support for their relationship to Blastocladiomycota means that this B+S clade is evolutionarily relevant and would arguably deserve a name, like Dikarya for Ascomycota + Basidiomycota + Entorrhizomycota. Any suggestion for that name?

This study demonstrates that V. cholerae colonization is increased by the presence of P. aminovorans in an infant murine intestinal model of infection. Through crystal violet staining and murine intestinal colonization with a ∆vpsL mutant of V. cholerae, it is shown that Vibrio exopolysaccharide (VPS) is necessary for P. aminovorans-dependent enhancement of V. cholerae biofilm formation and intestinal colonization. Microscopy also reveals VPS enrichment in areas of the pellicle with higher P. aminovorans abundance. Lastly, with mutants in accessary matrix proteins RbmA, RbmC, and Bap1, the researchers show that the ability of V. cholerae to form a structurally intact biofilm is necessary for P. aminovorans-dependent enhancement of V. cholerae colonization. Overall, this is a very interesting paper with insightful experiments that sparked a great discussion in our journal club group. This paper gives strong evidence that P. aminovorans promotes V. cholerae colonization in a VPS-dependent manner. With that said, we have some comments that may be beneficial for the authors to address. General comments * May be beneficial to keep y-axis scales for CFUs the same among all figures for more consistency * One-way ANOVA may be a more appropriate test for figures in which multiple comparisons are being made; we advise you to consider consulting a statistician on the appropriate statistical tests to use * The Mann Whitney U test is not a t-test, but is referred to as such in some of the figure legends. * It is mentioned multiple times that crystal violet absorbance was measured at 570nm, although measurements were made at 550nm for all crystal violet figures in the paper. * Discuss possible limitations with Wheat Germ Agglutinin; could WGA also stain GlcNAc produced by P. aminovorans? * Would be beneficial to describe in more detail the purposes of matrix proteins RbmA, RbmC, and Bap1, and why these were chosen to be studied. * One statistical test is mentioned at the end of every figure legend; is the same statistical test being formed on all panels in a given figure? If not, this needs to be clarified. * More details about how CFUs are quantified from pellicles in the results section would be good to add; the steps taken are only briefly mentioned and are a bit difficult to understand. Figure-specific comments * Story may flow better if in vivo data from Figure 2 is added to the end of the paper along with Figure 7 in vivo data; introduce enhanced Vc colonization phenotype with in vitro data first * Would be beneficial to show single and dual species P. aminovorans CFUs in Figure 2B and 2C and also single species P. aminovorans CFUs in Figure 3B to see whether P. aminovorans colonization also increases in the presence of V. cholerae * Address the purpose of the grid in Figure 4A * Figure 5A: Title claims that P. aminovorans increases V. cholerae biofilm formation according to data in Figure 5, but can only make this claim if CFUs are quantified in the in vitro model. * Figure 6 should have a Vc single species control to compare dual species pellicle to.",2021-09-05T15:00:48,,UAB BPJC,10.1101/2021.02.01.429194,Impact of a human gut microbe on Vibrio cholerae host colonization through biofilm enhancement,"Kelsey Barrasso, Denise Chac, Meti D.

We will correct it; we double checked our simulations and it seems like this has not propagated to our code. 2. This is a fair point. We will definitely consider adding in a mention to ry words. 3. We are currently thinking about this problem quite a bit. In our next version, we will discuss the specificity decrease (e.g. increase in repetitive k-mers indexed) when considering 1-local methods and how it translates to results. We have added some theory and some more experiments, stay tuned!
