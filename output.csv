https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.02.679940v1#comment-6780016777,biorxivstage,3,"In a recent preprint at bioRxiv (Yang et al., https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.02.679940), a group of authors led by Dr Anjali Kusumbe challenges an article from my lab published in 2024 (Koh et al. 2024, PMID: 39537918). The new preprint refers to Extended Data Figures and Supplementary videos that are unfortunately not provided at bioRxiv. Nevertheless, the manuscript text and the 5 main figures plus a proposed model contain a couple of major issues that I will cover here. A thread containing my comments plus useful illustrations is available on X ( https://x.com/ralfhadams/status/1976179960558539006). But before I do so, let me give you a little background. Several papers over the recent years have proposed that the bone marrow (BM) in skull is specialized and acts as an immune cell reservoir for the brain parenchyma and the meninges, a multilayered tissue structure that encloses and protects the brain and spinal cord. Key evidence comes from landmark publications by the groups of Matthias Nahrendorf (Herisson et al. 2018, PMID: 30150661), Jonathan Kipnis (Cugurra et al. 2021, PMID: 34083447), Ali Ertürk (Kolabas et al. 2023, PMID: 37562402) and others. Kolabas et al. 2023, for example, provide compelling results showing that skull “has the most distinct transcriptomic profile compared with other bones in states of health and injury” with potential relevance for neurological pathologies. The same publication also reveals that skull shows a strong response to stroke, arguing for interactions between the brain and a nearby bone marrow compartment. Our paper from 2024 shows that the BM of skull is undergoing substantial expansion in adult life but also during aging, which applies both to stromal cells (including vasculature) and a large range of hematopoietic cell subsets including stem and progenitor populations. Our paper makes use of well-established immunolabeling and imaging enabled by the injection of antibodies into living animals before they were sacrificed for tissue isolation. The removal of external tissues, including the meninges/dura mater on the brain side and dermal tissue on the skin side enabled undisturbed insights into the organization and expansion of bone marrow vessels, which exhibit the distinct dilated and irregular morphology typical for the sinusoidal vasculature of the BM. It is also noteworthy (and will be relevant later) that the expansion of the BM vasculature starts in frontal and parietal bones at the edges (near the sutures) and gradually progresses toward to center in young adult mice (10-14 weeks), whereas the interparietal bone is already filled with vessels (and hematopoietic cells) at this stage. Apart from imaging, we provide an extensive set of flow cytometry data in a large (22 page) supplemental file accompanying the paper, which confirms the expansion of stromal, endothelial, total hematopoietic cells and various hematopoietic cell subsets during adulthood and aging but also in response to various challenges (such as pregnancy and stroke). But even the skull of older mice is not spared from signs of aging. We observe that the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines is elevated in old skull in comparison to samples from younger mice. However, this affects fewer cytokines and involves lower levels of upregulation relative to age-matched (young and old) femur samples. Functionally, we show that shielding of either the head or the hindlimb allows the survival of young mice exposed to a lethal dose of irradiation (without BM transplantation). In irradiated old mice, however, only shielding of the head ensures survival, whereas animals with shielded legs gradually succumb over a period of 200 days, presumably reflecting the exhaustion of hematopoietic stem cells and early progenitor populations. These results and other evidence presented in the article led us to the conclusion that skull BM is more resilient to aging than its counterpart in femur. Now, let’s take a look at some of the claims raised by Yang et al. in their recent bioRxiv preprint. In Figure 1, they have reanalyzed selected subsets of scRNA-seq data from our publication to show that samples from old skull show hallmarks of aging compared to young skull. It is not clear (and is not explained) why certain samples from our data (available at GEO under the accession number GSE275179) were included in their analysis whereas other, equally suitable samples were excluded. In any case, it is not surprising and also not controversial that cells from old skull show an increase of aging markers compared to samples from young mice. We have never claimed that the skull BM stays young forever and, instead, we have reported the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines mentioned earlier together with other evidence such as myeloid-biased hematopoietic differentiation. Figure 2 of the Yang et al. preprint shows a comparison of mass spectrometry data from young (10 weeks) and old skulls/calvaria (79 weeks), which also indicates that markers of DNA damage and inflammation are upregulated, whereas markers of angiogenesis, osteogenesis and mitochondrial activity are downregulated. One would have liked to see a more detailed description of the sample preparation (e.g., were the meninges and other adherent/external tissues removed from the skull samples?), but the findings themselves are not surprising or controversial. Of course, old tissue samples show evidence of aging and are different from young skull samples. Things heat up a little in Figure 3 of the Yang et al. preprint. The authors claim that a dense, continuous network of vessels is found throughout skull samples from all ages and thereby challenge our observation that the calvarial vasculature and BM are dynamically expanding in adult mice. The evidence provided by Yang et al. includes transversal sections through the skull roof. The low magnification overview images in Figure 3b are of poor quality/resolution so that it is not possible to see much detail. The DAPI nuclear staining in the higher magnification images, however, suggests that the enlarged areas primarily correspond to tissue near the sutures, which already contain vasculature and some BM even in young frontal and parietal bones. Clearly, one would like to see better quality overview images and an unbiased comparison of central vs. peripheral areas from frontal and parietal bones. Things get more interesting and controversial in Figure 3c and d. Yang et al. use tissue clearing and light sheet microscopy to show the presence of a “continuous, dense vascular network throughout the skull frontal, parietal and interparietal regions in young mice”. The CD31 immunostaining in Fig. 3a, however, shows predominantly the meningeal vasculature, easily identifiable by hallmarks such as the sagittal and transverse sinuses consisting of large diameter blood and lymphatic vessels. Periosteal vessels might be also labeled, but it is not obvious that any sinusoidal vessels of the bone marrow are stained in this sample. Higher magnification images in Fig. 3d show more details of the meningeal (and perhaps also periosteal) vasculature in mice from different age groups. Again, it is very obvious that sinusoidal vessels with their distinctive morphology and large caliber are not captured in these samples. This is not surprising because expression of CD31 is low in sinusoidal (also termed type L) endothelial cells, as previous work from my group has established (Kusumbe et al. 2014, PMID: 24646994). Taken together, it is clear that Yang et al. have not carefully separated the vasculature of the skull and the adjacent meninges, leading to confusing results and wrong conclusions. Future research in this important field needs to clearly distinguish what is bone marrow, periosteal tissue, meninges or the surface of the adjacent brain. There is another small but interesting nugget hidden in Fig. 3c of the Yang et al. preprint. The freshly dissected skull sample prior to clearing shows distinctive areas of red blood cells in the interparietal bone but also in parts of the frontal bone. Our work has revealed a similar pattern of red blood cell distribution, representing regions of bone marrow, in freshly dissected young skull. In samples from older mice, these areas increase substantially, confirming the expansion of calvarial BM even in the absence of any immunostaining. Kolabas et al. 2023 (PMID: 37562402) also show a strikingly similar distribution of Nr4a1+ and propidium iodide (PI) labeled immune cells in calvarial bone marrow of young adult mice. Note the absence of immune cells in central regions of the frontal and parietal bone, whereas labeled cells (blue and red) are abundant in the interparietal bone. This is totally consistent with our own findings. Unfortunately, the sample showing aged skull is not included in the Yang et al. bioRxiv preprint so that a further comparison of young and old bone marrow will have to wait until the Extended Data Figures become publicly available. Before I move on, I would briefly like to address a technical detail. In the Yang et al. bioRxiv preprint, the authors claim that our Endomucin staining shows “aberrant nuclear localization”, which, according to them, suggests “that the current staining is artefactual and calls into question the reliability of their vascular imaging data”. This is just one of many strongly worded claims in the preprint. In reality, however, the Endomucin immunostaining shown by Yang et al. in the preprint is strongly overexposed, preventing any insight into the actual intracellular distribution of the antigen. The red (Endomucin) signal covers pretty much every part of the stained cells. The impact of different imaging and data presentation modalities, whole-mount vs. tissue sections and maximum intensity projection vs. isolated optical planes, also need to be considered. Furthermore, I have already mentioned that our study has used an in vivo labeling approach involving the injection of antibodies before the animals were sacrificed. This might lead to a slightly different pattern in comparison to post-fixation staining. Nevertheless, it is unambiguously clear that the bone marrow vasculature is stained reliably in Koh et al. 2024 (PMID: 39537918), revealing striking details of vessel architecture and regional differences. Before I continue with the next figure of the preprint, let’s have a quick look what other recent publications say about skull bone marrow. Chang et al. 2025 (PMID: 40970910), using advanced tissue clearing and light sheet imaging, report bone marrow expansion in a comparison of 2-month-old and 2-year-old skull samples. The data shown in Figure 5 of their publication independently confirms that large parts of the young calvarium are devoid of VEGFR3+ sinusoidal vessels, whereas older samples show a profound expansion of vessels, consistent with our own findings. A recent publication from the group of Warren Graham (Horenberg et al. 2025, PMID: 39984434) reports that “Emcn+ vessels demonstrated drastic morphological changes with aging, as bone marrow-resident sinusoidal blood vessel signal increases with age”. A recent publication from the group of Shukri Habib (Reeves et al. 2024, PMID: 39692737) has evaluated calvaria from mouse of different age groups by micro-computed tomography and other methods. In Figure 1A+B and the corresponding text, they state that “overall thickness from outer surface to inner surface of the parietal bone significantly increased with age” and they also show a striking increase of cavities (which, as we know, represent bone marrow areas) compared to young and adult calvarial bone. Overall, there is more and more emerging evidence supporting that the bone marrow in adult skull is expanding dynamically in adult mice, which involves changes in sinusoidal vessels but also in stromal and hematopoietic cell populations. Let’s return to the preprint by Yang et al. with a focus on Figure 4, which is another reanalysis of scRNA-seq data from Koh et al. 2024 (PMID: 39537918). This time, the focus is initially on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and CD45+ cells from young and old femur samples. According to the figure legend, this analysis is based on three samples – one from young and two from old femurs – that were subjected to the removal of hematopoietic cells prior to single cell sequencing. This depletion method is necessary to capture and enrich stromal cell populations, but these are obviously not samples that one would use for the analysis of hematopoietic cells. The remaining hematopoietic cells are residual contaminating cells that have escaped the depletion step, which is never totally complete. I would dispute that the analysis of contaminating cells allows meaningful conclusions about the abundance/enrichment of hematopoietic cell populations in aging femurs, but this seems to be exactly what Yang et al. have done. Could they have selected the wrong samples from our deposited data or mixed up the sample numbers? Who knows? In this context, I would like to point out that we had provided a substantial amount of information about our scRNA-seq data, the pretreatment of the different samples and other aspects of our methodology per email to Dr Kusumbe in early June 2025. Back to the preprint and Figure 5, which provides bulk mass spectrometry data comparing proteins from old vertebra and skull, which led the authors of the preprint to the conclusion that vertebrae are relatively protected from aging hallmarks in comparison to skull. The description of the methodology is unfortunately very brief. It is not clear which vertebrae were analyzed exactly (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, or all?). It is also not clear whether adherent muscle, fat, spinal cord and intervertebral discs were removed, all of which should influence substantially what is seen in the proteomic profile. In any case, it is obvious that this analysis is not confined to bone marrow and functional data for BM cells from vertebrae in comparison to other BM compartments is lacking. Obviously, future work will have to address how aging processes affect different BM compartments and thereby the function of the hematopoietic system. We are almost done, but I want to highlight another controversial aspect in the Yang et al. preprint, namely the presence (or absence) of lymphatic vessels inside bone. Based on the reanalysis of our scRNA-seq data from Koh et al., it is claimed in Fig. 1 and the accompanying text that lymphangiogenic markers are downregulated in aged skull samples. I would dispute that the presence of Cdh5+ Pecam1+ Prox1+ Ptprc- Flt4+ endothelial cells in the data supports the presence of lymphatic endothelial cells inside the skull bone or marrow. Chang et al. 2025 (PMID: 40970910), a publication that was already mentioned earlier, have examined this question in detail and they state that lymphatic vessels are present outside the skull in the periosteum but not inside bone marrow. The preparation of samples of skull and other tissues for scRNA-seq analysis is a race against time because it is essential to preserve RNA integrity as much as possible. This means that the removal of adherent, periosteal tissue residues including lymphatic vessels from the meningeal or the dermal side has to be done quickly, is most likely incomplete and might lead to residual contaminations. Essentially, the proposed presence of putative lymphatic endothelial cells in our data, which we have not validated ourselves, cannot resolve where these cells originate from. I want to conclude here and thank all of you who have read this thread till the end. As I have not been able to cover all issues in the preprint, I am considering another detailed thread once the Extended Data becomes public. I also hope that I have remained factual and sufficiently polite throughout my posts even though I perceive the language in the Yang et al. preprint as sometimes overly harsh and many claims unsubstantiated and wildly exaggerated. Final full disclosure: I am not only the last author of Koh et al. 2024 (PMID: 39537918) but also the former postdoctoral supervisor of the two last authors of the Yang et al. preprint.",2025-10-09T07:16:25,ralfhadams,Ralf H.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.23.671952v1#comment-6779701653,biorxivstage,0,"Great work. It would seem that the ""baseline setting"" (Figure 2) is unfairly favoring the semi-supervised methods. The same labels are used as input to guide integration AND for performance evaluation; this allows ss-methods to overfit the data, especially scGen and scDREAMER, which have many parameters.  Wouldn't it make sense to report the rankings based on a more realistic scenario, such as one with partial annotation or partially incorrect labels? On another note, silhouette coefficients have been reported to be suboptimal for this kind of benchmarks, and more appropriate metrics have been proposed, see e.g. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02743-4",2025-10-08T15:32:30,,M.A.,,,,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.27.656061v1#comment-6779669946,biorxivstage,2,"Since I was asked to review this paper several months ago and waived my anonymity on review, I'm sharing my review publicly here as a comment. The TL/DR is that I think this paper is both very informative, and very important. However, it does need to be contextualized as a deep study of a recovery cohort, which is then being compared to public data from cohorts with a significant percentage of people who are not recovering, and that needs to be accounted for. Comparing immune cells from the PBMC fraction of blood of people who all went on to recover to cells from tissue of cohorts including those made up of 40% people who did not go onto recover does not allow for making conclusions about differences between the blood and the tissue without accounting for the differences in immune responses of those on a trajectory to recover and those who are not. Those immune responses could look very different, both in the blood and in the tissue. Here is my full review: This is an important and comprehensive study by Rostomily et al., ""Multiomics Reveals Compartmentalized Immune Responses and Tissue-Vascular Signatures in Lyme Disease,"" which significantly advances our understanding of the immunopathology of acute Lyme disease (LD). I found it easy to read, and the figures were clear and compelling. By employing a longitudinal, multiomics approach integrating plasma proteomics, metabolomics, and PBMC immunophenotyping, supplemented with a meta-analysis of skin lesion transcriptomics, the authors present a compelling narrative of compartmentalized immunity. They propose that the robust alterations in circulating plasma proteins and metabolites, linked to endothelial barrier stability, metabolic reprogramming, and symptom severity, are predominantly driven by local immune processes within the skin and associated vasculature, while systemic PBMCs remain largely quiescent. It is quite surprising to see the PBMCs and metabolites show such fast resolution, and it feels like this is likely related to the complete recovery seen in this cohort.  This work offers novel insights into effective immune responses against Borrelia burgdorferi and the kinetics of recovery from infection, particularly highlighting vascular involvement, and provides a valuable resource for future biomarker discovery and therapeutic development in LD. A critical aspect for the authors to address, perhaps in the limitations or discussion, is the high recovery rate observed in their patient cohort. The manuscript states, ""Following antibiotic treatment, symptoms resolved in most patients, with only a few reporting mild symptoms attributable to LD at 6 months or at 1 year post-treatment"". This contrasts with broader literature suggesting that 10-20% of LD patients develop Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS) with persistent symptoms. It would be beneficial for the authors to discuss why their cohort experienced such a high recovery rate. Were specific exclusion criteria applied that might have inadvertently selected for individuals less prone to PTLDS (e.g., absence of certain co-morbid conditions known to be risk factors, that’s very interesting to speculate)? The methods section details exclusions such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, traumatic brain injury, prolonged undiagnosed somatic complaints, morbid obesity, sleep apnea, autoimmune disease, uncontrolled cardiopulmonary or endocrine disorders, recent malignancy, liver disease, major psychiatric illness, or substance abuse. While extensive, it's worth considering if these fully account for the low PTLDS rate. Additionally, the cohort demographics (Figure 1B) show a skew towards male patients (27 male vs. 22 female). Given that some infection-associated chronic illnesses, including potentially PTLDS, may skew female, could this gender distribution contribute to the observed recovery outcomes? Clarification on these points would help contextualize the study's findings regarding the typical immune trajectory of acute LD. Major Points: 1) Comparability of Meta-Analysis Cohorts: The conclusions regarding skin-derived systemic signals rely heavily on meta-analyses of public datasets (GSE63085, GSE154916, GSE169440). It is crucial to provide a more detailed comparison of the clinical characteristics (symptoms, treatment, PTLDS rates) of these external cohorts with the primary study cohort. For instance, the GSE63085 PBMC dataset is from a cohort with a reported PTLDS-like symptom rate of ~46%, substantially different from the near-complete recovery in the current study's cohort. These differences should be explicitly discussed as they could influence the nature and interpretation of immune responses. I wonder if the major differences seen in the skin vs PBMCs here are driven more by immune differences in people who are on a trajectory to recover vs those who are not. There are public datasets available on PBMCs as well, such as from the SLICE cohort including those on a trajectory to recover and those who are not. These should be compared in the analysis. 2) The finding of largely quiescent PBMCs in the face of infection and systemic mediator changes is surprising. The authors should expand their discussion to contextualize this observation against other types of infections, or Borrelia infections where people go on to develop borrelia infection-associated chronic illness. For example, how does this compare to PBMC responses in other chronic infections, tissue-localized (versus systemic/blood-borne) infections, or infections caused by slow-growing (like B. burgdorferi) versus fast-growing bacteria? Or, back to point #1, is this more just what PBMCs look like in someone who has been successfully treated with an antibiotic for a bacterial infection, and is this just what being on track to a full recovery looks like? That would explain why this looks so different from PBMC profiles in chronic illnesses like TB/HIV/HCV/ T. cruzi, but would make more sense in the context of a cleared infection and recovery. One additional thing to consider is that most of the immune granulocyte cells will be spun out of the PBMC fraction, but that does not mean those responses aren't circulating in the blood, they just won't be found in the PBMCs. 3) The T3 timepoint seems to stand out compared to T2 or T4, and it’s not clear why, and this isn’t adequately addressed in the discussion or limitations. Minor Points (Organized by Figure): Figure 1: Study overview and clinical manifestations Panel B: The gender distribution is skewed male. It would be useful to know if any sex-based differences in the measured parameters were analyzed, as this was not apparent throughout the manuscript. Panel C: The T3 (6 months) timepoint for C6 ELISA is missing; only T1, T2, and T4 are shown. Is that because T3 looks weird throughout, and you didn’t want to show it? Panel F: It would be helpful to indicate which correlations are statistically significant (e.g., using asterisks or by highlighting significant bubbles). Figure 2: Differential expression of circulating proteins and their correlation with symptoms Panel A: The separation into fast- and slow-resolving clusters is a very interesting and insightful presentation. However, the text states PRDX5 remained significantly elevated at T2, but this is not immediately clear from the heatmap's visual representation for PRDX5 in the T1-T2 comparison. Only IL17C is labeled as significant (T2-T3) in the slow responding genes. Panel B: It is unclear why not all rows are labeled as they appear in A across all pathway comparisons, which makes it harder to assess the full dynamics. Maybe this circles back to the fact that some of them were significant T1-T2, and not T1-3, but then again yes T1-4 so maybe it looked messy to show it that way? But this way you only show the first set it was significant for, and not the dynamics in between… Panel C and D: The rationale for selecting T1 versus T3 for this heatmap of cardiovascular, metabolism, and organ damage proteins could be clarified, especially as Panel A focuses on pairwise comparisons across all timepoints. And at other times T3 seems to be intentionally excluded. Displaying patient-based trends rather than just row-based averages might also be informative. The asterisks on the left indicating significance are somewhat hard to read on the opposite side from the label. Panel E: This is a visually appealing figure, though the bundling can make specific correlations slightly challenging to trace. Figure 3: Integrated community analysis and diagnostic modeling Panel A: Could the authors add descriptions of any shared features or overarching themes among the analytes within each of the three largest communities beyond endothelial disruption/protection? The rho scale for symptom correlations (-0.4 to 0.6) suggests many correlations are not very strong; indicating that adding statistical significance for these symptom correlations would be beneficial. Panel B, C, D: These ROC curves are interesting for diagnostic potential. Suggestion: If data are available, showing a baseline ROC curve using standard clinical diagnostic features (e.g., EM presence, basic serology if used for initial classification rather than just inclusion) could provide a useful comparison for the multiomic models. Figure 5: Minimal peripheral changes in acute LD Panel A: The highest variance explained by PC1 in the PCA of PBMC abundances is relatively low (18.4% for patients, 16.2% for controls), suggesting considerable heterogeneity not captured by the main principal components. Panel B: The decrease in plasmablasts over time would possibly be expected if it aligned with the development of memory B cells. But that doesn’t seem to be the case from this data. That might be a fit with what Nicole Baumgarth has described in B6 mice, and definitely warrants further discussion. Panel C: The UMAP visualization shows minimal separation. Without non-recovered patients, it's difficult to discern disease-specific trends versus inter-individual variability. Figure 6: Dramatic changes in a case with severe disseminated disease The boxplots effectively highlight how different the severe outlier patient is. This case underscores the point that systemic activation can occur. I really wonder if compared to publicly available data from people who did and did not recover after their acute infection, if you would see a lot more of this. Replicating this in a dataset with more patients with severe, non-recovering disease would be necessary to draw broader conclusions about this hyperinflammatory state. Figure 7: Skin immune responses reflect plasma protein and metabolic signatures Panel A: the source/location of ""unaffected skin"" biopsies can influence cellular profiles. This should be addressed. Panel C: The differential expression of CXCL8 (IL-8) across various skin-resident cell types is very interesting as is LILRB4 expression in skin-resident cells which would support the tissue-based regulation hypothesis as long as we had more comparators between the symptoms and inflammatory state of the individuals these cohorts. I think this paper is both very informative, and very important. However, it does need to be contextualized as a deep study of a recovering cohort, perhaps being compared to cohorts with more people who are not recovering, and that needs to be accounted for.",2025-10-08T14:25:37,michal_tal,Michal Tal,,,,

Here are our highlights: This study explores how simple molecular interactions (partial hybridization between RNA sequences) can change the course of evolution. The authors show that product inhibition, which might seem to slow things down, actually helps populations maintain diversity and obtain new adaptations FASTER. Without hybridization, the fittest sequences rapidly outcompete all others, driving the population into a low-diversity state centered on a local fitness peak. This SLOWS adaptation, because new mutations can arise only from a narrow set of closely related sequences. With hybridization, all sequences partially inhibit each other, preventing any single clone from sweeping the population. This maintains a broad pool of genetic diversity for longer periods, effectively flattening the adaptive landscape and accelerating the discovery of fitter variants. Hybridization transforms individual fitness from a fixed property into a population-dependent quantity: the reproductive success of a sequence depends on the presence and abundance of other sequences. This introduces frequency-dependent selection, reshaping the evolutionary dynamics without altering mutation rates or external conditions. In classical models, large networks of nearly neutral genotypes allow populations to drift across genotype space. Product inhibition breaks this neutrality by making fitness context dependent. Sequences that were previously neutral can become advantageous or deleterious depending on the surrounding population, creating a constantly shifting fitness landscape.",2025-10-07T13:37:08,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

Future studies could use the Townlet method to evaluate how rare mutations shape cellular phenotypes. Typical GWAS studies require hundreds to thousands of participants to account for confounders and small effect sizes. The GWAS-in-a-dish method used here measures each donor's proliferation/survival repeatedly over time, which removes confounders, clarifies the genetic signal, and drastically cuts the required number of participants to draw the same conclusions as a much more difficult study design.

Here are our highlights: This study investigates bacterial adaptation to cold shock tracking the fitness time dynamics of thousands of mutants. The authors demonstrate that adaptation unfolds in distinct phases: early survival depends on membrane fluidity and cell wall remodeling, while later recovery relies on RNA-level regulation and ribosomal function. They highlight a synergistic role of ribosomal methyltransferases in restoring protein synthesis after translational arrest. We admire the time-resolved design + comparative analysis of two model species, which helps distinguish conserved from species-specific elements of the cold shock response.",2025-10-07T12:59:05,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

This claim is highly dubious as the results seem to indicate that the ‘enhanced sampling’ they refer to is equivalent to adding small amounts of guassian noise to samples already present in the MD training data. In fact, this result is expected - when generating samples from a DDPM, a simple prior distribution is iteratively transformed to a sample from the data distribution through noisey purturbations in the direction of maximum likelihood. Consequently, it comes as no surprise that generated samples are highly similar but not exactly identical to samples from the training data. Upon additional training of a DDPM on a single dataset, one expects that these deviations should asymtotically decrease until the DDPM ‘memorizes’ the training data and generate nearly exact copies of the training data. In the context of MD, adding gaussian noise to pre-existing samples from long-time MD is generally not considered a useful enhanced sampling method, unless noise perturbed structures are subsequently evaluated with a potential energy function and are subject to some aceptance criteria, as is done in metropolis hasting / MCMC sampling methods. I do not belive that the ‘enhanced sampling’ the authors claim to obtain from over-fitting DDPMs on single MD datasets is of the same nature as that expected from standard enhaced sampling methods for MD like replica exchange or metadynamics, which aim to explore completely new regions of phase space that are otherwise difficult to access and not yet characterized. The authors present no evidence that their procedure is able to generate samples that are substantially different than those already present in the MD training data - therefore, I would not consider this an enhanced sampling method in any sense. Moreover, the DDPMs presented here are trained to maximize the likelihood of generating samples that are similar to the training data distribution - there is no incentive for the model to explore new regions of phase space and one could argue that if their model were producing samples highly dissimilar to the traing data - it would suggest that the model is either under-fit or systematically incapable of appropriately modeling the training data.",2025-10-04T19:58:19,,annonymous,,,,

I found this research paper to be interesting because a lot of previous research before has not discussed how DNA from terrestrial animals can be found in the air and this information could help with biomonitoring similar to how eDNA is utilized in aquatic settings. I understand that this type of research has never been done before and it demonstrated how this technology can detect species in zoos and demonstrates how it can serve to be useful in the biodiversity field. I do wonder since there are high levels of contamination within these air samples how reliable could the samples be? I also understand that the method of sampling each information costs a lot and I wonder how this could be accessible to various laboratories dedicated to protecting biodiversity? I’m curious to know if you were able to develop further tools to mitigate the effects of contamination within the data samples collected. I thought it was incredible that in a zoo setting the  biodiversity monitoring was able to identify specific species and the location of those species. Another question I have with this information is if you have given thought if the information could have been different if the tool was placed in a wild life setting instead of a controlled environment such as the zoo? Overall, I think this paper and the research done with various methods will help with further research as to how DNA from the air can be utilized to revolutionize biodiversity further in the future.

The most critical issue is the use of HEK293T embryonic kidney cells as a “normal control” for gallbladder cancer, which is biologically inappropriate and invalidates much of the comparative analysis. The reported patient validation is based on only 3–5 samples, which is statistically underpowered and cannot support strong conclusions. The claims of discovering “novel miRNAs” are based solely on in silico prediction, with no experimental validation. The central mechanistic assertion — that miR-17~92 directly targets Cdt2 — is not demonstrated with luciferase reporter assays, which are a gold-standard requirement in miRNA research. Moreover, the paper overstates therapeutic implications without any in vivo data, making such claims premature and misleading. Overall, this work reads as a descriptive sequencing dataset inflated with overstated conclusions.

The team demonstrates, for the first time, that genome language models (Evo 1 & Evo 2) can transcend protein- or circuit-level design and generate complete, viable phage genomes with evolutionary novelty. What stands out to me as someone deeply engaged in AI-driven drug discovery and computational biology is the rigorous integration of multi-layered constraints: from sequence quality, gene architecture, and tropism specificity, to evolutionary diversification. Such hierarchical filtering mirrors the multi-stage AI pipelines we build for therapeutic design, where generative creativity must always be balanced by biological feasibility. Equally impressive is the experimental validation: 16 fully functional phages synthesized from ∼300 AI-generated genomes, some with faster lysis kinetics and higher competitive fitness than the natural ΦX174. The ability of a cocktail of these phages to rapidly overcome bacterial resistance underscores how AI-guided genomic exploration can access adaptive solutions beyond natural evolution—a principle that could redefine both antimicrobial strategies and synthetic biology at large . On a broader horizon, this work offers a blueprint for steerable, constraint-driven genome design. Much like our own efforts in applying generative AI to novel small-molecule scaffolds for resistant cancer targets, this study exemplifies how language-model-based frameworks can capture the hidden rules of evolution and recompose them into functional biological systems. The implications span from phage therapy to programmable synthetic organisms. Congratulations to the authors for pushing the frontier of generative biology—this is not just phage design, but a proof-of-principle for the next era of genome-scale AI-driven engineering.",2025-09-29T13:06:57,disqus_awfLwDEvYQ,Mohd Sufiyan Khan,,,,

If we need ~200 characters for a good estimate of the relationships between 20 tips, this makes me wonder whether we should be using a 10:1 ratio as a rule of thumb.  If we’re interested in the relationships between 20 taxa, and we can only score 100 characters, my intuition says that including more taxa would still improve our estimate of the relationships between the 20 taxa of interest, even if the placement of the ‘extra’ taxa is uncertain.  I’d be interested to know whether your study has any suggestions here. I also wonder whether you tried using the Clustering Information Distance alongside the Robinson–Foulds, as the biases with the RF distance seem like they could be particularly problematic in a study such as this, where the misplacement of a single taxon could be a likely event (see Smith 2020, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa614).  On a similar vein, I wonder whether it would be more meaningful to take the mean distance between trees in the posterior distribution and the true tree, rather than selecting a single tree – there is no guarantee that the MAP tree is representative of the posterior distribution (though potentially some tree space analysis could support the assumption that it is).

If you are not yet aware of it, you may be interested in our paper from several years ago: https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(23)00244-2. Basically, although the moment-based estimates are useful (and almost mandatory for inference over non-iid samples), it is also relatively straightforward to compute the full likelihoods by quadrature. As the cells within a cell type are assumed iid here, this is more or less compatible with the framework. The low-beta regime can also be represented as a two-state model with bursty (and potentially leaky) expression in the active state, slightly more straightforward to solve numerically. For the connection to ATAC, please see https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.110.064405. The same model is straightforward to generalize to some latent regulator or a coupled series thereof (although the best way to define such coupling is still obscure). The joint modeling of these quantities is a somewhat underexplored problem. One key issue we raise in the PRE paper is that noise modeling for ATAC is unusually challenging. There are, of course, other challenges, like the slightly non-iid nature of measurements across supposedly homogeneous cells (""cell size"" effects) and the usual DNA/gene mapping issues: how should one map a peak to a particular gene? How should one represent the relationship between multiple peaks that all ostensibly control or overlap a single gene? It is exciting to see people pursuing mechanistic approaches for this  problem, and I look forward to future work.",2025-09-23T20:28:30,gennadygorin,Gennady Gorin,,,,

The build-test workflow is clearly described, and the recovery of infectious particles provides a strong experimental anchor for the computational design story. This is a great demonstration of what is currently feasible for whole-genome phage engineering. However, it misses a major opportunity to contextualize the generative model performance with explicit baselines. This makes it difficult to assess whether there is a true advance due to the ability of the generative model to move in sequence space with success rates (~16/300) above alternative (lightweight) models. Moreover, the sequence space explored here appears to stay close to known natural sequences, so it is hard to appreciate how the generative model adds novelty beyond proximity to existing genomes. Side-by-side comparisons against simple alternatives (for example a consensus design, frame-preserving randomization under GC and codon constraints, ancestral reconstruction, or family statistical models such as direct coupling analysis) would clarify whether the model improves assembly success or shifts resistance outcomes. Recent studies provide useful templates for such “null model” panels, see OpenCRISPR Figure 3E ( https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12422970/), and ProGen Lysozymes Figure S10 ( https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10400306/) for evaluating LLM-generation of proteins. Including analogous baselines here, with success rates and resistance readouts reported for each, would make the impact of this contribution and generality of this approach unmistakable.

Although I used the imperative mood in some sentences, never feel obliged to do them. They are just some ideas. (Being a non-native speaker of English, my comments seem to sound too harsh sometimes) 1. You mentioned ""solely using data at high spatial frequencies"" and ""use data only at high spatial frequencies"". This sounds as if you did not use low frequency signals but I guess CryoSPARC's initial resolution and maximum resolution parameters only set the high resolution cutoff, not the low resolution cutoff. In other words, if you use ""Initial resolution 5 Å, maximum resolution 2.3 Å"", it uses DC to 5 Å in early iterations and gradually increases the high resolution cutoff until it reaches DC to 2.3 Å in the last iterations. Am I wrong? 2. You mentioned that ""other approaches that we and others have tried produced maps with no interpretable high resolution structural features"" and ""other parameters often converged on false minima"". Could you please describe what was tried and unsuccessful? For example, in all cases, you set ""center structures in real space OFF"". Was this essential? ""Enforce non-negativity"" was TRUE for calmodulin, FALSE for Hb-dimer and Aca2-RNA and not mentioned for iPKAc. Again, were these choices critical? You used ""a beta version of CryoSPARC v5, which has an option to apply a soft spherical mask to the ab initio volume at each iteration"". Was this new masking feature essential for success? 3. Your ""final resolution"" in the ab initio jobs (but why is it called ""maximum resolution"" for iPKAc?) is higher (i.e. numerically smaller) than the final, refined resolution. Was this necessary? What is the minimum (i.e. numerically largest) resolution necessary for success in each case? If you can solve the structure using lower resolutions for alignment, you can get reasonable resolution estimates without gold-standard (GS) splits in cisTEM's way. 4. In general, refinement fails when the starting (reference) model is too bad beyond the radius of convergence and/or when individual particles are too noisy to be aligned. Of course, these two are not independent; noisier particles can be aligned with a better reference. Regularization (e.g. using GSFSC or non-uniform refinement) and injection of prior information (e.g. Blush) improve the radius of convergence by making the energy landscape of the target function smoother. It would be interesting to see which problem (bad initial model or noisy alignment) hampered structure solution in these cases. 4.1. You briefly mentioned refinement trials using HR-HAIR maps as the initial reference. It would be interesting to do this more systematically. Take a HA-HAIR map, low pass filter it at various resolutions and perform refinement with global search. When does it succeed? Is the resolution different from the minimum resolution required for ab initio jobs (point 3 above). If they are very different, regularization by GSFSC might be too strong. Another possibility is that the loss of SNR in half 1 reference and half 2 reference relative to the full reference made alignment too hard. When GSFSC was proposed, this effect was said to be negligible (and overcome by a better regularization), but it might make a critical difference for extremely difficult cases like this. 4.2. It is also worth testing marginalization over poses. Does it help, or make it worse? 4.3. For some datasets, you used only a subset of the EMPIAR entry. This gives you a good chance to perform the test 4.1 more rigorously. Perform HA-HAIR on particles from the first X movies. Then perform refinement tests on particles from the remaining movies. If ab initio succeds but global search refinement fails with N particles, doesglobal search refinement succeed with 2N particles? If so, the SNR reduction due to GS split was the culprit. 5. Another idea to assess the resolution when the GSFSC is unavailable is as follows. Take a non-GS HR-HAIR map and low pass filter it to say 3.3 Å. Refine an atomic model against it. Calculate the map-model FSC on the original, non-low pass filtered map. Because an atomic model refined to 3.3 Å has predictive power beyond 3.3 Å, it can be used to gauge whether the map contains chemically sensible information beyond 3.3 Å. (You should first verify this strategy on maps with known GS resolution) Sorry for my lengthy and scattered comment. I am still thinking a better way to investigate this interesting observation and validate the resolution and haven't consolidated my thoughts fully. I just wrote what I have so far. I hope at least some of the above is useful for your investigation.",2025-09-22T13:17:23,disqus_2p28leFhmb,Takanori Nakane,,,,

I used this paper to practice peer review with my MSc Wildlife Conservation students. I thought the peer review process could be helpful, therefore I have copied the review we created below: This study aimed to quantify the temporal dynamics of chytrid infection in Yosemite toads, with a particular focus on changes in infection dynamics before and after the first hibernation period in metamorphs. The authors hypothesized that changes in physiology and/or exposure associated with hibernation could alter pathogen infection rates and growth. To test this, they sampled first-year metamorphs across six alpine meadows before and after their first hibernation. They also sampled tadpoles, juveniles, and adults during the same pre-hibernation period to explore infection patterns across age classes, although sample sizes for tadpoles and adults were relatively small, and these cohorts were not sampled after hibernation. The authors found that tadpoles were free of infection, whereas infection prevalence increased to about 20% in first-year metamorphs before hibernation and then rose sharply to over 90% after hibernation. Infection prevalence and intensity remained high the following summer. They suggest this striking increase is linked to hibernation itself, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Two hypotheses are brought up in the discussion: (1) metamorphs may already be exposed prior to hibernation, but immune suppression during hibernation allows pathogen proliferation to detectable levels, or (2) metamorphs enter hibernation chytrid-free and become infected during hibernation. Notably, no effects of infection on morbidity were detected, suggesting Yosemite toads may act as asymptomatic carriers. Overall, I found the study nicely written, interesting and relatively well designed, with some exceptions. The methods are largely appropriate for the central question of whether hibernation in first-year metamorphs contributes to chytrid persistence in this population. The inclusion of a conceptual figure of the study design was particularly helpful. I have no major concerns regarding the methodology. That said, I did find parts of the manuscript confusing and have several suggestions for improvement. My primary conceptual criticism is that the results apply only to first-year metamorphs. To test more robustly whether hibernation itself drives changes in infection dynamics, it would have been valuable to examine adults or even other nearby species that do not hibernate (although I understand that these would be subject to different climates). Including these comparisons would strengthen the case that hibernation per se influences infection prevalence. As it stands, the study convincingly demonstrates a link between dormancy and infection dynamics in metamorphs, but not necessarily beyond this cohort. I encourage the authors to specify this in the abstract and to emphasize that the mechanisms remain unresolved. I also found the introdiction quite confusingly structured and did not fully outline what is known from previous studies or provdie enough information on the ecology of the study species and why it makes a good model system to test these questions. I have more detailed comments on the introduction below. Section-Specific Comments: Introduction The introduction clearly states the study’s aims but would benefit from more detailed context on the current state of knowledge. Summarizing prior studies in greater depth - for example, Kasler et al. (2023), which is mentioned in the discussion but not the introduction - would help the reader understand the state of the knowledge and where the gap or conflicting evidence arises. At present, the introduction focuses too heavily on highlighting the results, while the rationale, state of the field, and knowledge gaps are underdeveloped. A bit more information on the ecology of Yosemite toads would also be helpful. For instance: Can chytrid transmission occur during hibernation? Do toads hibernate individually or communally? Why is this species particularly interesting for examining infection dynamics beyond the fact that it hibernates? The authors also assume that everyone knows about chytrid – the fact that is causes huge population declines and extinctions, and any known factors on its spread and persistence, are not even mentioned. The structure of the introduction is somewhat disjointed, with results and knowledge gaps raised in multiple places rather than in a logical sequence. I suggest beginning the introduction with chytrid fungus (or emerging fungal pathogens more generally), followed by discussion of seasonal and life-history drivers of infection. Dormancy could then be introduced as a potentially important factor early on – but starting with dormancy when this paper is fundamentally about understanding drivers of chytrid infection and maintenance is possibly confusing to some. Notably, the authors argue that their results “challenge current thinking about seasons,” yet the introduction contains little background on known seasonal effects on chytrid dynamics. Providing this context would make their justifications and interpretation more compelling. Finally, sample sizes are difficult to find in the text. Including these in Figure 1 and briefly outlining the study design at the end of the introduction would improve clarity on methods. Overall, a thorough restructuring and expansion of the introduction would make it more informative and logically ordered. Methods I had questions about the modelling framework. Why were pre- and post-hibernation cohorts analyzed separately? Would a zero-inflated model have been more appropriate for intensity data, and were these approaches considered? Presenting model outputs and explanatory power in a supplementary table would improve transparency. Additionally, it would help to explain why juveniles and adults were only sampled at a single meadow and time point, rather than following the same design as metamorphs. Clarifying these decisions would improve understanding of the study’s scope and limitations. Results It is unclear why only two figures are presented in the main text, with the remainder in the Supplementary Materials. Some of the supplementary data would be valuable in the main body, ideally integrated into a single figure that allows direct comparison across life stages and survey periods. Figure 3 should include sample sizes, as in Figure 2. It is also unclear why tadpoles are not represented in this figure, given their relevance to the infection trajectory. Discussion Much of the contextual information in the discussion would be better placed in the introduction (e.g., references such as Kasler et al. that address similar questions). This shift would allow the discussion to focus more sharply on how this study advances understanding and to highlight its limitations (e.g., small adult sample sizes, lack of non-hibernating species for comparison). Supp Materials Note that zeros are missing in one of the intensity figures, and that the order of the meadow sites is not always matching across figures.",2025-09-19T09:29:01,alicerisely,Alice Risely,,,,

In general, we hope to have contributed to the literature not a rebuttal of the work of others, but a clear exegesis of what we consider to be a valid in cellula system in which to test PAC1 antagonists destined for use in vivo, and potentially in the clinic. When in cellula (or in vitro) systems provide disparate data about the efficacy of a given agonist or antagonist, we believe it falls to specialist practitioners in the field (in the case of PACAP antagonist discovery, we include ourselves) to attempt to resolve contradictory findings, since this should ultimately lead to more predictive assays, and more rationale and effective drug development going forward. It is important to understand that the final goal is to establish compound efficacy in vivo, It is important to understand that the ultimate goal is to establish compound efficacy in vivo. Therefore, we prefer not to apply artificial stress conditions to cells in order to force a compound to display any antagonist effect. We also emphasize the importance of including an antagonist control (such as P6-38 or M65) in any testing system to properly validate the compound. In that regard, workflow for development of PAC1 antagonist SMOLs for therapeutic effect (see, for example, the recently published report by Shintani et al. about PA-[915] as a potential antidepressant Molecular Psychiatry; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03209-4) might benefit from inclusion of in vivo target engagement models, such as phenocopying drug effect with regiospecific PAC1 knockout animal models, to more firmly establish the mechanism of in vivo actions of putative PAC1 SMOL antagonist compounds.

First, is a lack of an additional necessary control group (or maybe it’s just not explicitly stated?).  The Cx3cr1-CreERT2 is a heterozygous KO of Cc3cr1.  A control group with the Cre but no flox is necessary to determine that the results are related to the cross and not to the Cx3cr1 deficiency.  Without that it’s not possible to attribute the results to the c1q KO alone. The second is that the wrong statistical test appears to have been employed throughout the paper.  The authors are testing both c1q+/- and Arc+/- yet only perform one way ANOVA.  This needs to be a two-way ANOVA and the overall ANOVA player should be reported on graph in addition to post-hoc values.

Major Points: The limited effect of thermodynamics: While I might not have a clear understanding of evolutionary changes, especially with respect to this study, I think that thermodynamics might not be the only major factor. Although one of the main aims is situated around the entropy-enthalpy trade-offs as classified using the properties that constitute the free energy of binding calculations. I suggest that thermodynamics might not be contributing solely to this characteristic observed The effects of kinetics, which are not addressed, might have some contribution, probably of equal magnitude with thermodynamics contributions We agree that ligand recognition and transcriptional regulation can be influenced by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors, and that equilibrium measurements alone do not capture the full dynamic picture. In this work, our mechanistic analysis is framed specifically in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics obtained from ITC.  While kinetics and thermodynamics are linked, the equilibrium measurements presented here do not resolve the kassociation and kdissociation rates separately. Our conclusions pertain to the thermodynamic shift observed along the reconstructed trajectory. We agree that it would be valuable in future work to determine whether ligand association/dissociation kinetics vary with the thermodynamic driving force along this trajectory. Limited evolutionary trajectory: Since the family is said to have existed for approximately 3 billion years, analyzing thermodynamic properties of just 4 ancestors and an extant Lacl might be speculative rather than factual about the whole family We acknowledge that the LGF is ancient and that this study examines only four reconstructed ancestors along a single trajectory plus extant LacI. Our aim is not to make claims about the entire family’s history, but to characterise in detail the thermodynamic and structural transition along one evolutionary path. The reconstructed sequences for Anc1 to Anc4 had high posterior probabilities and the trajectory spans major sequence and functional changes within the clade, linking structural features to changes in binding thermodynamics. Future work could extend the approach to additional nodes or other ancestors in this trajectory or clade to understand how general these thermodynamic shifts are across the full diversity of LGF regulators. Minor point: Overall, the paper was well written, but one misspelling that caught my attention is the paragraph on page 14 below Figure 5 caption, in the last sentence. “It should be noted that he apo and d-fucose....” where ‘he’ should be ‘the’ We apologise for this error, and thank the reviewer for their comment. We will correct this error in future versions. The SEM bar on Figure 2 (a) appears to be slightly invisible, I suggest changing it to a darker color, or an overall bar graph color that is well-contrast with the error bars. We agree that this change would add clarity, and we will update this in future versions. Since the major points might not contribute directly to this paper based on the author's aim, the paper can be published as is after incorporating the minor edits.

We agree that the sign and magnitude of dCp directly influence how the enthalpic and entropic components change with temperature. Given the higher thermal stability we see for Anc1 and Anc2, the dCp values for these ancs would tell us how their thermodynamics change with temperature, and whether the balance between entropy and enthalpy seen at 25 ºC would be the same or different in potentially ancient hot environments. In this study, our ITC experiments were performed at 25 °C to ensure comparability of dH, -TdS, and dG across reconstructed nodes and ligands under identical conditions. Determining dCp would mean performing ITC series with repeats at multiple temperatures for each protein-ligand pair, which was beyond the scope of this work but we agree would be valuable and insightful for future investigations.",2025-09-17T05:58:29,rosiegeorgelin,Rosie Georgelin,,,,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.23.644840v2#comment-6769205781,biorxivstage,2,"Reply from the authors, Rosie Georgelin and Colin Jackson: We thank CJ, Galen, and James for their thoughtful, constructive, and high-quality feedback. Many of these suggestions will be incorporated into a future version of this manuscript. We address each point in detail below: Major points Point 1. The authors propose that Anc1 has a spatial redistribution of entropy away from the ligand binding site to the distal loops to compensate for the loss of conformational entropy upon binding. Can they test this hypothesis by truncating or stabilizing (by point mutation) the loops? Despite a cooler earth at present, there are still organisms that live at hot temperatures. Do the extent orthologues in these organisms show entropically driven binding? Do the ancestors reported in this function as transcription factors at higher temperatures? Can the authors propose an experiment to test this? It’s interesting that Anc1 is the most thermally stable of the TF’s (based on the hypothesized relationship between earth temperature and protein thermal stability) yet the structure suggests it’s the most disordered compared to Anc4. Can the authors comment on how this fits within their proposed model? Point 1. We agree that truncating or stabilising the mobile loops that gain flexibility upon ligand binding could be a useful way to probe spatial entropic redistribution. We also note the caveats that such edits can alter pocket geometry, hydration, or long-range allostery, so any dH/-TdS shifts might reflect changed interactions rather than reduced flexibility per se. Regarding temperature, the LGF phylogeny includes thermophilic phyla, but their thermodynamics have not yet been measured. While higher temperature scales -TdS and can amplify entropy-driven modes like Anc1 at 25 °C, this is not exhaustive across thermophiles: many thermophilic proteins are pre-rigidified and use pre-organised polar contacts and ordered waters, which keep dS small or negative while maintaining favourable dH. Consistent with prior observations that extant and ancestral thermophilicity need not be mechanistically identical (Hobbs et al., 2012, MBE, DOI:10.1093/molbev/msr253), we therefore present the Anc1-Anc4 trajectory as a sequential thermodynamic trend that highlights a potentially important role for thermodynamics in protein evolution; discussion of ancient high temperatures is offered as a possible explanation for the observed pattern, not a blanket rule for all high-temperature proteins. Further exploration of the thermodynamic behaviour of extant thermophiles in this family, were highlighted in review and so we plan to do some experimental work to probe these points of interest. As to function at higher temperatures, the in vivo assays were incubated at 37 °C and indicate continued transcriptional regulation by the TFs at that temperature, while ITC was conducted at 25 °C to provide a consistent comparison window for binding thermodynamics. A natural extension could be ITC across a temperature series up toward the Tₘ values of the ancestral TFs, including above 37 °C, although this would not be a trivial undertaking. The outcomes of dCp calculations would be interesting, we don’t believe it would affect the interpretation of our conclusions. Finally, while we recognise the apparent tension between Anc1’s high melting temperature from DSF/CD and its open, flexible structure; we do not see these as contradictory. A high Tm is compatible with a strong core and key secondary structures coexisting with retained flexibility distal to the binding site. Indeed, Anc1’s crystal structure shows one highly ordered domain and one more disordered domain. Global stability from thermal unfolding does not directly reflect on local flexibility, and flexible loops or mobile domains can persist in proteins that resist complete unfolding (Liu et al., 2018, PNAS, DOI:10.1073/pnas.1807473115; Wintrode et al., 2003, JMB, DOI:10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00147-5). Point 2. The possibility that ancestral reconstruction artificially stabilizes proteins has been acknowledged in the literature (e.g. PMID 27413048). Are the authors concerned that the changes in stability observed in their work might be due to the stabilizing effect of consensus mutations? Point 2. We agree that literature has shown ASR can introduce stabilising mutations into proteins, with ancestors sometimes but not always (Hart et al, 2014, PLOS Biology, DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001994), exhibiting higher melting temperatures than extant proteins, and some good reviews (Wheeler, 2016, Curr Opin Struc Bio, DOI: 10.1016/j.sbi.2016.05.015) explore this deeper than we will here. However, literature does not show similar promotion of  entropic binding in the ancestrally designed  proteins. If the increased thermal stability in our ancestral TFs is due to bias by ASR design methods, it is coupled with a similar correlated increase in entropic contribution. We only hypothesise that these two characteristics (Tm and dS) are related, due to this correlation. Point 3. The authors focus on the LBD of the LGF family for structural studies and point out that Anc1 (the most distant ancestor) exhibits a greater level of disorder compared to the most recent ancestor Anc4. Is this level of disorder also expected to occur in the DNA binding domain or is it disorder unique to the LBD? In other words, does evolution only act on one domain of this family or are there correlated changes to the DBD as well (allosteric mechanism)? Point 3. We didn’t focus on the DNA-binding domains in this paper, except to note that they still function allosterically in vivo and are able to bind/unbind to LacOsym operator. A related paper on the same phylogenetic tree of ancestral TFs ( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2024.03.002) shows that the DNA-binding domain (DBD) is a highly rugged evolutionary landscape, likely because ruggedness minimizes promiscuity/crosstalk in gene regulation. Binary on/off specificity avoids off-target regulation as families diverge. This is less critical in the development of ligand specificity, which can evolve over a much smoother evolutionary landscape with less dire consequences for off-target binding when compared to the genetic regulation inferred by the DBD. Although the DBD wasn’t the focus of our structural study, we agree that the differences in LBD vs DBD evolutionary mechanism is very compelling. Point 4. It’s interesting that D-fucose binding was largely lost by Anc2 (or not tested?), can the authors provide a structural reason for that similar to their analysis with Anc4? Further, with respect to Figure 4 can authors show (perhaps just an AlphaFold prediction) what the composition of the substrate binding site looks like between each ancestor? Was there a sudden change between Anc1 and Anc2 in composition or was it more gradual (also given the D-fucose binding is almost lost between Anc1 and Anc2 - again was that actually tested)? Point 4. In the high-throughput screen (using DSF to assay the Anc TFs against a library of small molecules) we found no detectable ligand stabilisation by d-fucose to Anc2. We in fact found no significant stabilisation by any of the tested small molecules, particularly compared to the strong responses seen in the other Ancs. We did still test d-fucose using ITC against all Ancs 1-4, and in the in vivo testing too. We found Anc2 response to d-fucose was not significantly different to the sucrose negative control in the in vivo tests, and also found that ITC could not produce any binding curves when Anc2 was tested with d-fucose, as expected, and so was not illustrated in the Fig 2 data. Inclusion of these non-responsive ITC experiments would likely make this clearer, and we will include this in any future versions. Anc1 and Anc2 have a sequence similarity of approximately 75%. Between these two ancestors, we see the functional transition of binding d-fucose to binding BMDG, partially based on the mutation of two significant binding site residues, F73L and W189S. These residues make the Anc1 binding pocket much more hydrophobic, and sterically bulky, compared to Anc2, and likely accounts for the change in specificity from Anc1-2, although we also expect that epistatic networks of mutations also affect binding specificity beyond just these two identified mutations. Differences between Ancs 2-4 in terms of thermodynamic contributions of entropy and enthalpy have less obvious binding pocket mutations than Anc1-Anc2, so are likely imparted by more overall changes in dynamics from distal mutations. Point 5. “It should be noted that he apo and ᴅ-fucose-bound ΔAnc1 structures were obtain from crystals from same crystal screening drop i.e., the observed differences are not due to differences in crystallization conditions”. Was this a co-crystallization experiment where two crystals were looped from a single drop - one crystal led to a structure with fucose bound and the other was apo? Crystals with different symmetry (and different crystal packing) can grow in the same drop from identical conditions. The listed space groups in Supplementary Table 2 indicated that the space group was different for the apo and fucose-bound Anc1. Is there concern that the conformational change observed between holo and apo-protein is influenced by the differences in crystal packing? The cell dimensions are similar, can the authors check that the data indexing is consistent? Point 5. We apologise for any ambiguity in the methods. The apo and d-fucose bound structures originated from the same crystal drop, where the crystals were grown without d-fucose. A crystal was fished out, as the apo sample, before the drop was soaked with d-fucose, and another crystal removed as the d-fucose bound structure. We agree that polymorphism could occur in this instance, where crystals grown in the same drop have different space groups. However, we hoped that conducting our experiment this way, using the same drop, would minimise differences in packing between ligand-bound and apo structures that might arise through separate co-crystallisation experiments. We agree that the cell dimensions are similar, and we put this down to the ligand binding event inducing repacking that changed the symmetry, likely through twinning. We used Xtriage to test the presence of any twinning in our Anc1 crystal structures. Running Xtriage on the merged and scaled apo reflections gave no indication of twinning in P212121 space group (twinning in P212121 is not possible), while the holo reflections strongly suggested twinning (type PM, twin law -h,-k,-l) with space group P21. Confirmation with Zanuda in the CCP4 suite showed that apo P212121 was the best space group for Anc1 apo. Zanuda could not distinguish P2 or P1 as better space groups for Anc 1 holo in terms of Rfree, but could categorically rule out P212121 as the holo space group. We found that refinement with P21, using the twin model identified in Xtriage, gave best density for the ligand, and better Rfree/Rwork values, and thus we concluded that Anc1 holo is most likely P21 (twinned). We will include the discussion of this twinning in any updates of the crystallographic statistics table/methods. What assisted us in our conclusions that crystal packing didn’t radically affect our interpretation of structural flexibility was the agreement between apo and holo, as well as an Anc1-glycerol bound structure that was solved from a different crystallisation experiment and in a different space group, were in good agreement with the areas of disorder/flexibility in Anc1. This supported the conclusion that the disorder we see in Anc1 is a reflection of the properties of the protein, as we see them in different space groups and experiments. We are in the process of performing molecular dynamics simulations to further test this. Point 6. The authors point out that LacI is a functional homodimer in Figure 1 but do not distinguish whether they are investigating the homodimer or monomeric form in subsequent experiments. It would be helpful to clarify which oligomeric state they are investigating in their experiments (DSF, ITC, etc.). See minor point 3. Point 6. In the crystal structures and at the concentrations where the protein was functionally tested, it is predominantly in the homodimeric form; it is also functional in vivo - again consistent with it adopting the functional homodimer. Point 7. D-fucose is smaller and more hydrophobic than BMDG/lactose. It follows that a protein’s binding pocket that is smaller and more hydrophobic (e.g. better packed) will favor D-fucose binding. Given that core packing is a well-established mechanism of protein stabilization (e.g. PMID 27425410), how do the authors think about whether this reflects well established principles in molecular recognition and protein stability vs novel mechanistic insight specific to sugar recognition evolution? Point 7. We agree that hydrophobic packing can favour smaller ligands and contribute to protein stability. However, our results indicate a distinct and evolvable thermodynamic mode switch in sugar recognition along the LGF trajectory that cannot be explained by a shrinking pocket size alone. In fact we find that, generally, Anc1-d fucose adopts a more open, less well-packed binding mode when compared to the Anc4-BMDG complex that undergoes a distinct open-closed transition upon binding. We hope to not overemphasise the stability of Anc1 as the main point of this paper; if Anc1 is more stable due to its more hydrophobic binding pocket, this doesn’t mean these effects aren’t related to how Anc1 has evolved to recognise a particular sugar like d-fucose, or the thermodynamic drivers of this binding. This idea of a hydrophobic binding pocket leading to high thermostability is not a trend observed in all other small sugar binding proteins. Minor points Point 1. Check the Figure 4 legend matches the subpanel letters. E.g. panel “a” shows BMDG not D-fucose. Point 1. Thank you for pointing this out! We apologise for the confusion, and will fix this in future versions. Point 2. IPTG is a synthetic analogue of allolactose and is unlikely to be encountered by evolution in the context of this work. Was this included because it was in the initial carbon source panel? Point 2. We agree that IPTG is not a naturally occurring molecule, and did not include it in tests of our Anc TFs including the high-throughput screening. Additionally, we used lactose as the positive control of our in vivo assays. We include the structure of IPTG in figure 2 for clarity on its similarity to the assayed sugars (fucose, BMDG, etc), as a comparative structure for those readers likely more similar with LacI binding to IPTG. Point 3. Supplementary Figure 6. Only Anc3 and Anc4 appear to have a well defined transition in the CD melt curves. Are the fits to a sigmoidal curve meaningful for the other curves? How were the uncertainties calculated for these fits? Perhaps quote confidence intervals instead of SEM? Point 3. We agree the transitions for Anc3 and Anc4 are the most sharply defined, whereas Anc1 & Anc2 show less pronounced baselines and broader transitions. In line with that, the Anc2 CD Tm has a visibly larger uncertainty (+- 6 °C) than the others, reflecting weaker constraint by the data, while Anc1’s CD fit gives ~91.0 °C, and the DSF scan did not detect a transition within range (so we reported as >100 °C). Together these indicate an increase in thermostability toward deeper ancestors, with Anc1 recorded as a lower bound by CD and a high Tm by DSF, but we agree the precision differs among constructs. The DSF dye is known to interact with exposed hydrophobic patches in native states for some proteins, accordingly, we treat the DSF value as an upper bound rather than an exact Tm and use comparison to the CD derived data for confirmation. We agree that CIs could be more informative than SEM for these less certain melt fits, and would better reflect any uncertainty in the data. Point 4. “ᴅ-fucose retains degrees of freedom in the Anc1 binding pocket, contrary to the idea that ligands lose their conformational entropy on binding.” How was “degrees of freedom” assessed in this case? Were multiple conformations observed in the electron density maps? Point 4. We observed d-fucose to have moderately higher b-factors when in the Anc1 binding pocket, compared to BMDG in the Anc4 binding pocket. We observed that, of the 8 Anc1-fucose proteins in the asymmetrical unit, fucose bound not with a strictly different conformation i.e. all motifs of the 8 sugar rings pointed in overlaying directions. However, the sugar ring itself displays some puckering between copies, and while the protein units overlay with most binding pocket residues in >0.5 Å agreement, the O5 in the d-fucose differs between copies in up to 1.7 Å shifts. Point 5. Ensemble refinement (PMID 23251785) was used to assess protein disorder, however, it is not mentioned in the results text. The Rfree values for the input models to Supplementary Table 5 to help comparison. The Rfree values were up to 5% worse for the ensembles compared to refinement of a single structure (e.g. 21.21 vs 26.21 for the Anc1 glycerol structure). This suggests that the ensemble is worse than a single model. The authors should justify the inclusion of these results. Point 5. Thank you for noticing this - our initial pTLS setting came from the optimise pTLS option and was sub-optimal for Anc1:glycerol; we will instead include our fine grid ensemble refinement results with an explicit pTLS grid (0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0). We note that ensemble refinement was not used for actual refinement of the crystal structures, but as a method for visualising the flexibility in the ancestral structures. We did no specific analysis of the ensemble refinement, so it was not elaborated on in the results section. We are in the process of re-doing this refinement accordingly. Point 6. The lac operon regulates genes associated with the metabolism of lactose. What did the fuc operon regulate? (Perhaps the genes are hinted at in gray text in Figure 1b?) Point 6. The fuc operon encodes transporters and enzymes for the uptake and catabolism of L-fucose, found in plant cell walls and host glycans. Although our experiments focused on D-fucose, as identified as the strongest binder in the HTS, L-fucose was also screened for and identified as a potential binder in Anc1, although not to an extent that satisfied our requirements for a strong binder, of >2 ºC stabilisation in the DSF HTS. In our study, we do see D-fucose as being able to allosterically signal LacOsym regulation and functioning as a regulator, as lactose does in LacI. The question of what a D-fucose binding LacI/GalR TF was doing several billion years ago is interesting; we don’t want to speculate too much. However, D/L ratios from abiotic chemistry were likely to be less skewed to L-fucose than in extant systems, and it is possible the “true” ligand is a close analog of D-fucose that had an important role at the time. Point 7. “These findings are suggestive of an evolutionary transition from binding of lactose/BMDG to ᴅ-fucose.” The reverse, right? D-fucose in ancestor, Lactose in extant? Point 7. Yes, we agree this is confusing, and we will update this sentence in future versions. Point 8. Figure 2d could be improved by adding the results from all sugars tested with each ancestor. Point 8. Thank you for your suggestion. This info is in the supporting information presently, and it will be moved up to the main text in future versions. Finally, thank you for the help in improving the paper - our first (hopefully not last) experience of open peer review!",2025-09-17T05:56:51,rosiegeorgelin,Rosie Georgelin,,,,

The application of membrane inserts which provides a natural like environment for ovaries and whole mount antibody staining that helps to detect proteins in intact tissues/organs are interesting.

Major Comments In the introduction part, the paper doesn’t explain the objective/s of the protocol and its advantages over the pre-established protocols and the improvements it has. For intact and big tissues, like ovaries, light sheet microscopy is a good choice to evaluate the 3D structures of the ovary and its content. Therefore, the paper would be more complete if it evaluates the ovaries with light sheet microscopy. The discussion is not referred to and compared with previous studies in which it is difficult to validate and understand the protocol novelty and variability. Minor comments On the protocol section, Subsection 2, it says “All reagents used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1.”  However, the table is not found anywhere.  It is also better to use different numbering systems for different headings (e.g.  Roman numbering system for the subheadings, Arabic for the details.). In addition, it would be clearer if the experiment design (control and treatment groups) is clearly presented in the protocol section, ethics and mice subsection. Figure 2, (C-C’-C’’) needs more clarification about what it represents. On graphs, significance bars are missed on the graphs E and G. There are some grammatical and typo errors. Especially, the Ovary culture and the Result part should be written in a very simple and concise way for better understanding. Overall, this work will be very useful for researchers studying reproductive biology involving ovary.",2025-09-16T14:34:39,hailemariamamsalu,Hailemariam Amsalu,,,,
