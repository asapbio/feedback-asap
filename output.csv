https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.07.663460v2#comment-6752240102,biorxivstage,0,"Congratulations on the work! This is an impressive achievement, and it's refreshing to see a particular research community conducting a large-scale metaresearch endeavour to reflect upon itself. That said, based on these results, I’m not sure I’d jump to the conclusion that Drosophila immunity has a replication rate that is higher than in other areas. Some of the studies cited as reproducibility estimates in other fields (Amaral et al. 2025, Errington et al. 2021), as well as large-scale efforts in psychology (e.g. Open Science Collaboration, 2015) and economics (Camerer et al., 2016) that helped spur the “replication crisis” narrative, have relied on performing independent replications of a particular sample of publish findings. This is quite different from reviewing the literature to look for conceptual replications, as the authors do to arrive at the conclusion that most of the findings in the field are verified (i.e. around 84% of those for which a published verification attempt was found). Interestingly, for the findings which the authors do replicate independently, replicability is much lower (only 16%). Although this large discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the authors focused on unchallenged and suspicious claims (which seems to be their preferred explanation), an alternative hypothesis is that there is a huge amount of confirmation bias in the Drosophila immunity literature, either because attempts to replicate previous findings tend to reach similar results due to researcher bias, or because results that validate previous findings are more likely to be published. As I think both explanations are plausible (and, not being an expert in the field, I’d have a hard time estimating their relative probability), I think the work would be greatly strengthened if the authors tried to replicate a sample of those findings that were validated in the literature. If they arrive at a similarly high replication rate, this would strongly support the authors’ interpretation of a high replicability of findings in the Drosophila immunity literature. If replicability is much lower in the authors’ independent replications than in the published ones, on the other hand, this would suggest that the high replicability estimate obtained from the literature should be taken with a grain of salt, and could be due to a large confirmation bias problem. I obviously understand that this would be a lot of work, but I do think it would matter a lot in terms of making skeptics (including myself) agree with the claim on high replicability.",2025-08-14T14:56:42,olavoamaral,Olavo Amaral,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.02.645026v3#comment-6752224057,biorxivstage,1,"Thanks for the comment! There is indeed a reasonable amount of heterogeneity between individual replications for many of our experiments (although it is smaller than the heterogeneity between replications and original results, as shown in Table 3). That said, I can only vouch for point (a) above: labs were theoretically under no pressure to achieve a particular result. They were also blinded to the original result and, unless they had a strong intuition about it or made an effort to look it up (which we consider unlikely), should not be influenced by it. Concerning point (b), we did not fully standardize protocols across labs: when methodological details were not provided in the original experiment, we asked for each lab to fill gaps independently so as not to overstandardize to a particular choice that might not correspond to what was done originally. Labs were also free to suggest adaptations to the protocol when they thought these were required – and in some cases they made quite different choices about how to deal with ambiguities or inconsistencies in the original article. Thus, part of the heterogeneity might be attributed to protocol underspecification in the original study. As the coordinator of the Initiative, I also cannot personally vouch for point (c). Although we tried to include measures to control bias in all protocols, and stimulated labs to include additional controls and checks when deemed adequate, each replication was ultimately performed in a particular lab by a different team, in the best conditions available at that facility, with no direct external supervision. Thus, I would not call those “very controlled conditions” – they are probably more accurately described as the “standard conditions in a Brazilian academic lab”. Protocol breaks were frequent (as shown in Fig. 5), and errors or inconsistencies in results were ocasionally detected and corrected, but there is obviously room for undetected errors or undercontrolled technical variability to affect results. Thus, I would not go so far as stating that there are intrinsic limitations to replicability in biomedical science: my conclusions would be more in the direction that “there are limits to replicability in Brazilian academic biomedical labs”. Some of these limits could be intrinsic, but many of them likely relate to infrastructure, researcher expertise, lab organization and other issues. And while my guess that most of these issues probably hold in other countries as well, this cannot be directly extrapolated from our data.",2025-08-14T14:24:00,olavoamaral,Olavo Amaral,,,,

Congratulations on a detailed study of this endemic species. I agree with you that a detailed Red List assessment is necessary and this data will certainly help. In this regards, I have a few suggestions for the paper. 1. Please do not criticize earlier assessment as based on literature survey and lacking field data. Many assessments start like this, as there is often data gap due to lack of local/regional research. It is perfectly valid to conduct an assessment with available data, as the purpose of assessment is to draw attention of conservation world, not to produce a paper. There is always possibility of re-assessment, in fact there are clear rules on how to go for it in Red List system. You can notice that the assessment clearly states ""needs updating"" on the Red List site. 2. If you want to conduct this assessment, its best to first take the assessor's training course https://www.conservationtraining.org/course/ which is necessary, if not mandatory. It can clarify many key terms. 3. If you have used modelling for the assessment work, it is necessary to get it validated as per Red List norms. The guidelines are openly available. 4. Coming to the assessment, an occurrence point map is needed and you can use GeoCAT app to calculate EOO and AOO. 5. If the EOO and AOO, are fitting within EN, you need to put a proper argument for (a) or (b)(i,ii,iii,iv,v) . Do you have data to say a. Species is severely fragmented? (even if you have not collected it, it is possible and accepted to make an informed guess based on species behaviour and biology) b. If not, then it hinges on the number of locations. Please do not equate this with occurrence points or localities. There is a specific definition of ""location"" which requires proper understanding of threats. c. continuous decline in habitat quality/extent etc can be definitely argued (known the habitat well), but that argument has to be detailed and based on hard evidence. There very specific evidence based reasons as to why EOO, AOO are mapped, calculated in a specific way. So although you may have different or more detailed data or view of it, unless you are able to put it in technical manner accepted by Red List, it would not be accepted. My suggestion is complete the training course, and then start a proper assessment. I will be happy to help you with the basics, but for actually updating the assessment in the online portal, you will have to contact and work with the relevant species specialist group.",2025-08-10T14:35:13,aparnawatve,Aparna Watve,,,,

However, in the original assay the learning is carried out on adult worms with F1 embryos (and germ cells) in utero which are exposed along with the parent (P0) to the pathogen. For maternal inheritance, effects at F2 are generally still considered intergenerational (ie maternal) effects - not ""transgenerational"" epigenetic inheritance. The effect would have to be shown at F3 (and also F4 as the original Murphy study showed) for them to really claim validation of the study. I refer the authors to the following review (PMID: 24679529), cited >2000 times, on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance which clarifies this point: ""In the case of an exposed female... the fetus can be affected in utero (F1), as can the germ line of the fetus (the future F2). These are considered to be parental effects, leading to intergenerational epigenetic inheritance. Only F3 individuals can be considered as true **trans-generational ** inheritance (see Box 1), in the absence of exposure."" Given the F2 effect in this eLife study is already quite small, its imperative that the authors show F3 and F4 data to actually test the original Murphy claim. Moreover, in some of the Murphy experiments, effects at F3 and F4 are even stronger than they are at F1. So, this should not be a problem if the authors have actually replicated the Murphy results.",2025-08-08T17:10:33,reviewer6,Reviewer 6,,,,

This is totally on me and I will upload a version properly crediting the work tomorrow! Also, emailed the 1st author of gLM apologising for this. Regarding benchmarking the work, we decided not to initially do that because of two reasons: 1) Key motivation for us was genome-level tasks, like phenotypic traits prediction, strain clustering, genome generation and long-range interaction prediction and as you know gLM focuses more on gene regulation and function. 2) We are very confident that scaling pLM (for example to ESM-2 650M used in gLM) would significantly boost overall results, so I feel like it would be not a fair comparison to compare the two models which use different base pLM models, and we have limited computational resources (we had access to a bunch of Intel GPUs on which we performed the training, but we no longer have access to them) and scaling up to ESM-2 650M for ~3B proteins for pretraining requires a lot of GPU hours. 2. That's a great point which we have not considered, and in retrospect I agree with you that in reality it should be treated as two separate tasks. This is something which we will introduce in the next iteration of the model/manuscript!",2025-08-05T18:39:41,maciejwiatrak,Maciej Wiatrak,,,,

I wonder if you should replace most, if not all, occurrences of the word ""conserved"" with a form of the word ""identical"". ""Conserved"" (in the protein context) can mean identity or similarity, the latter being a more elastic term, that can depend on which matrix you choose and then your definition of the degree of similarity that you determine to meet your definitional threshold. Reading this preprint, I have the feeling you mean identical amino acids when you say conserved amino acids. Or maybe ""conserved"" means similar and ""fully conserved"" means identical? Would be great to clarify this. Note that we use likelihood ratios to calibrate evidence for clinical variant classification, not sensitivity and precision. In your first pass you had 4,328 & 26,006 for the P/LP variants and 245 & 16479 for the B/LB. That yields LR+ of 1.55:1 and 1/LR- of 7.25:1. That would not meet the supporting criterion (+1 Bayes conditional probability points) for pathogenic evidence. It would meet moderate evidence (-2 Bayes points) for benign evidence. When you increased stringency, you got 3,884 & 26,450 for P/LP and 102 & 16,622 for B/LB. That again does not meet the supporting threshold for pathogenic evidence (1.6:1) but it does strengthen the benign evidence with 1/LR- or 15:1 (between moderate and strong, -3 points). Not sure I am doing the math correctly from your data - feel free to correct me if I am wrong about this.",2025-08-04T18:32:32,leslie_biesecker,Leslie Biesecker,,,,

Ayres2, David S Schneider3 and Roel Nusse3 1. University of British Columbia 2. The Salk Institute 3. Stanford University We write in response to the preprint  by Lemaitre and colleagues that challenges the reproducibility of our published findings on wntD (Nature, 2006) and Edin (PLOS Pathogens, 2008). While we welcome efforts to independently validate and extend prior findings, we believe that the conclusions drawn by the authors are not supported by rigorous replication and, in several key respects, reflect significant experimental and interpretive flaws. Mischaracterization of the wntD Mutant Allele The preprint by Lemaitre and colleagues centers on the observation that our original wntD allele reproduces the published phenotypes, but a second allele does not. The authors infer, based on quantitative PCR in early embryos, that our stock must have lost the mutation and that the observed effects are due to background variation. However: •	The qPCR assay used by Lemaitre and colleagues is technically invalid for assessing the integrity of our allele. As clearly described in our original work, our wntD mutant was generated by insertion of a w⁺ cassette into the wntD coding region—leaving the 5′ portion of the gene intact. The primers used by the authors target this unaffected region and are therefore expected to detect RNA transcripts, even though the resulting mRNA is non-functional. This is a fundamental flaw that undermines their central argument. •	The authors did not attempt genomic PCR or sequencing to verify the presence or structure of the mutant allele in our stock—an essential step before invoking reversion or mislabeling. •	The phenotypes associated with the original wntD allele were in fact replicated in their hands, contradicting their own assertion of irreproducibility. The failure of a second allele, generated in a different background and evaluated under different conditions, does not constitute a failure to reproduce but rather a failure to validate by independent means—a distinction that matters. Strain Background and Controls Lemaitre and colleagues raise concerns about genetic background effects while applying inconsistent standards in their own work. Our original wntD experiments were conducted in a y-w- background, and controls were matched accordingly. Their second allele appears to be in a wild-type background, yet their comparison is made to both y-w- and w1118 lines. It is well established that immune phenotypes in Drosophila can be highly sensitive to background variation. As such, a difference in phenotypes between two alleles in different backgrounds is neither surprising nor indicative of poor reproducibility. Misinterpretation of wntD Expression Patterns The preprint by Lemaitre and colleagues suggests that wntD is only expressed at embryonic stages, questioning its relevance to immunity. However, the Fly Cell Atlas reveals specific clusters of cells expressing wntD in the whole body, gut, and Malpighian tubule samples. Moreover, additional studies have demonstrated that wntD is in fact inducible in adult flies upon infection with either L. monocytogenes or S. pneumoniae, supporting its role in immune modulation (Chambers et al., 2012, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002970). The claim by Lemaitre and colleagues that the field has not followed up is inaccurate. Edin: Distinction Between RNAi Knockdown and Knockout In the case of Edin, Lemaitre and colleagues observe that a knockout mutant lacks the infection sensitivity we previously reported using fat-body-specific RNAi. They suggest off-target effects as a possible explanation. However: •	We demonstrated the phenotype using two independent RNAi lines, reducing the likelihood of off-target artifacts. •	The tissue specificity and temporal dynamics of RNAi versus germline knockout are fundamentally different. Loss of a gene during development may engage compensatory pathways that are not triggered in an acute knockdown context. •	The conditions of microbial challenge differ between studies and were not standardized, further complicating direct comparison. Edin Overexpression: Dose Matters Lemaitre and colleagues report that Edin overexpression is not deleterious in their system, but this is entirely consistent with our findings. In our original study, mild overexpression had no phenotype; only very strong overexpression (>600-fold) triggered a measurable deleterious effect. The line used in their study achieves ~50-fold overexpression and would not be expected to phenocopy our results. Conclusion While we support efforts to critically assess past findings, we reject the characterization of our studies as “non-reproducible” based on the experiments presented by Lemaitre and colleagues. The authors did not repeat our experiments as described, used different alleles, different controls, and in some cases, flawed assays. Differences in outcome under these circumstances are part of the normal course of scientific investigation and should not be conflated with a failure of reproducibility. We encourage future studies that further explore wntD and Edin biology, using rigorously matched conditions and appropriate validation techniques. Scientific progress depends on careful experimentation, not just reanalysis. Sincerely, Michael D. Gordon, email: mikedgordon@gmail.com Janelle S.

Dan taught me how to think mechanistically, how to test assumptions, and how to pursue scientific clarity with unflinching rigor. That legacy is all over this paper. And is incredibly needed in this era of AI hype where data volume often sidelines careful model-driven science. Herschlag et al. show that while AlphaFold3 predicts protein structures with backbone-level structural precision, it struggles to capture the physical rules that govern biological function. But this paper isn’t a takedown: it’s a roadmap for how to go further. What They Did Rather than rely on RMSD alone, the team evaluated AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3 against: →Energetic rules: bond torsions, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals contacts →Experimental ensembles: from multi-temperature crystallography →Model confidence: comparing pLDDT to physical plausibility What They Found: ~30% of side-chain interactions deviated from experimental observations, often with incorrect partners or implausible geometries High-confidence predictions (>90 pLDDT) still showed strained or physically invalid conformations Energetically-favorable conformations could increase RMSD and be penalized by the model AlphaFold3 missed ~85% of conformational variability seen in real experimental ensembles Key Insight: Physics ≠ Proximity AlphaFold can recapitulate Ramachandran and Lennard-Jones-like patterns. But that doesn’t mean it understands physical constraints. To improve these tools, we need evaluation metrics grounded in molecular energetics, not just geometry. 🎯 Takeaway for Scientists This paper is a reminder that progress requires more than prettier predictions.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.15.664939v2#comment-6741788142,biorxivstage,1,"Interesting analysis. In light of the reliance on MeSH subject indexing, I draw your attention to NLM's own data on the performance of machine indexing approaches in different categories, documented in the NLM Technical Bulletin: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/ma24/ma24_mtix.html. The check tag category (which includes the species labels on which the OPA iCite tool relies) F1 score (combining precision and recall) for MTIX (introduced in 2024) was 87% versus the original (human) indexing approach -- that is, significantly lower performance. And for a period of time before the introduction of MTIX, NLM was using a different machine indexing system, MTIA, whose F1 score for the check tag category was only 62% compared with human indexing. So, depending on when MTIA started to be used, and the proportion of records that were indexed with MTIA versus human indexers, I wonder how confident we can be that the relative proportions of different categories of MeSH terms truly reflect the prevalence of different categories of research over time. I also note, in the same source, that the performance of MTIA and MTIX at appropriately labeling Medline articles with supplementary concept terms was even worse than their performance with check tags: 39% and 71% versus human indexing. Supplementary concept terms are especially relevant to innovative, novel science (including basic science) -- terms that may in the future become MeSH terms. It's perhaps not surprising that tools trained on historical data are not great at handling novel concepts, but poor performance by machine indexing tools at applying appropriate supplementary concept records may be another factor in the apparent decline in basic science research. I'd also like to comment on the iCite Translation Module (of which the Human/Animal/MCB category assignment is part). I'm not really clear on how many PubMed records get such category labels. On the one hand, iCite includes all PubMed records. On the other hand, presumably only articles with MeSH terms can be assigned in the Triangle of Biomedicine -- that is, articles in journals that are indexed in PMC but not Medline are not included in the human/animal/MCB analysis. I assume that the proportion of PubMed records with Medline indexing has gone down, as NIH-funded authors publish more papers in journals that aren't indexed in Medline (many of which didn't exist at the start of this longitudinal analysis). Indeed, thanks to Ed Sperr's handy tool PubMed-By-Year, we can see that Medline records (ie, records with MeSH terms that can be analyzed by the human/animal/MCB categories in iCite) as a proportion of PubMed records was above 90% until (I am eyeballing the figure at https://esperr.github.io/pubmed-by-year/?q1=medline [sb]&startyear=1990) around 2011, at which point Medline coverage started declining quite precipitously. So, any analysis that relies so heavily on MeSH indexing is going to be leaving out a large number (and an increasing proportion) of recent papers.",2025-07-23T15:35:02,,Kate Nyhan,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.14.664673v1#comment-6740532082,biorxivstage,1,"The article presents compelling anatomical evidence for a distinct Intermediate Leptomeningeal Layer (ILL) in the human CNS; however, critics may point out that it remains a preprint lacking peer review, and its conclusions are primarily based on postmortem specimens with limited demographic diversity. The specificity of immunohistochemical markers used to define the ILL is debatable, as several are not exclusive to this layer. Furthermore, while the study suggests functional roles in CSF dynamics and immune surveillance, these claims are largely inferential, without direct in vivo or radiological validation. Technical constraints in ultrastructural imaging and overlapping interpretations with known meningeal modifications also raise questions about whether the ILL represents a truly novel anatomical layer or a reinterpretation of existing structures. Sample Limitations: The study uses 61 specimens, including postmortem adults and fetal cadavers, but lacks detailed demographic or pathological stratification. Results may not be generalizable across age groups, disease states, or different causes of death. Also, tissue autolysis postmortem could influence histological findings. Interpretation of Immunohistochemistry: The identification of the ILL largely hinges on marker expression (e.g., Podoplanin, Prox1, Lyve-1, Claudin-11). However Some markers used are not exclusive to the ILL. There is overlap in marker expression with other leptomeningeal cells, which may complicate interpretation. The specificity of these markers to a distinct anatomical layer may be overstated. Conceptual Ambiguity: The ILL is described as both structurally distinct and continuous with modifications of the pia (e.g., filum terminale, ligamentum denticulatum), which introduces conceptual overlap. This may challenge the claim of a fourth meningeal layer as a standalone structure, as it could also be interpreted as a differentiation of existing leptomeningeal tissue. Functional Claims Require More Evidence: The paper suggests that the ILL has barrier and immune surveillance functions, but these are inferred from: Marker expression (e.g., E-cadherin, CD68, CD3) and Limited injury models (e.g., trauma cases). Functional conclusions are suggestive but not definitively demonstrated, especially regarding CSF dynamics and immune response. Lack of In Vivo or Radiological Correlation: Despite discussing imaging evidence in the introduction, the study does not provide radiological correlation (e.g., MRI, contrast-enhanced studies) to support the anatomical observations. Without clinical imaging, it's difficult to ascertain how (or whether) the ILL can be visualized or detected in living subjects. Technical Limitations in TEM/SEM: The authors acknowledge challenges in visualizing the ILL using Transmission Electron Microscopy due to the width of the human SAS. Consequently, ultrastructural validation is incomplete and fragmented. Conclusions about junctional integrity and macrophage-like cells at the ultrastructural level may lack comprehensive support. Historical Oversight or Reinterpretation: While the authors cite historical literature that may have alluded to similar structures, they assert that ILL has never been clearly identified. Critics might argue this is a reinterpretation of known anatomical variants rather than a truly novel finding. This raises questions about whether the ILL is a distinct layer or a rediscovery framed through a modern methodological lens. Need for Functional Studies (In Vivo / Genetic Models): Unlike recent mouse studies (e.g., SLYM in mice), this study does not include functional in vivo or genetic data (e.g., knockout models, CSF tracer studies) to show the physiological importance of the ILL. This limits translational relevance and understanding of how the ILL may impact neurological diseases or therapeutic interventions.",2025-07-21T02:00:55,,Padamjeet Panchal,,,,

I'm wondering whether other DNA extraction protocols might improve your viability inference, as other protocols might better retain original DNA fragment sizes (which are likely lower for extracellular DNA). For example, we usually use enzymatic lysis and magnetic bead purification for ONT sequencing, since it seems to better protect DNA integrity: https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-023-09537-5. We generally see larger reads for freshly extracted isolates than for stored metagenomes, and we see large differences in read sizes between strains in microbiome samples. We think this could be related to how easily different species are lysed throughout the protocol, but we didn't test this yet. In our hands, bead-beating and spin columns caused read lengths to be lower and to have a more homogeneous size distribution.",2025-07-18T12:54:57,brambloemen,Bram Bloemen,,,,
