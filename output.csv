We see that cryopreserved cells have better cell quality, higher UMI and higher gene counts. We haven't test the ambient DNA, but given that cells are not permeabilized, I would assume that should also be true. Yet, there are two things to consider: 1) Given that your cells are alive they get stressed when you thaw them, and this is reflected in their transcriptome. Not really strongly, but it is something to consider. 2) DMSO is toxic for cells and some cells, such as neurons, are more sensitive to it. In our analyes we observed a significant depletion of neurons in the DMSO cryopreserved samples (and not using any other preservation method). We think this may be due to DMSO toxicity or simply because neurons are more fragile and survive worse freezing/thawing cycles. In any case, it impacts the cell composition. So, if you wanna study neurons, as in our case, with DMSO you are loosing lots of them and getting more progenitor cells instead (that survive better the freezing/thawing cycles).",2022-08-10T10:58:29,mireyaplass,Mireya Plass,10.1101/2022.08.03.502652,Methanol fixation is the method of choice for droplet-based single-cell transcriptomics of neural cells,"Ana Gutiérrez-Franco, Mohamed N.

Authors: Oana M. Enache, Veronica Rendo, Rameen Beroukhim, Todd R. Golub and Uri Ben-David A couple of years ago we reported Cas9-induced p53 signaling in cancer cell lines (ref 1). Here, Guo and Xiong address the possibility that this finding is affected by cell line sex biases (ref 2). In their preprint, they are trying to make 3 points related to our paper. We will address each of these points separately. 1) TP53 mutations also shrink and not only expand upon Cas9 introduction. To study the trend of p53-inactivating mutations to expand or shrink following Cas9 introduction, we performed an analysis of pre-existing subclonal mutations (Fig. 3d in ref1). As mentioned in our paper several times, we deliberately restricted this analysis to pre-existing mutations with 0.02 1% in gnomAD (ref3); see Supplementary Data 3 and our exclusion criteria described in the Methods section of ref1). We therefore think that it is a mistake to consider this mutation as an ‘inactivating TP53 mutation’ as well. Importantly, if one were to include the clonal inactivating mutations that Guo and Xiong have added to our analysis in their Fig. 1a2, then there is no justification for the exclusion of mutations that were not detected at all (AF~0) in the parental cell line but were present in the Cas9-expressing cell line, such as the mutation observed in the cell line SNU1 (Fig. 3c in ref1). However, this event was excluded in Fig. 1a of ref2. Similarly, if one were to include known SNPs in the analysis, then there is no reason to exclude the one in the cell line JHH7, which emerged from AF=0 to AF=1 (and was excluded both from our original analysis and from Fig. 1a2). In other words, the inclusion criteria for Fig. 1a of ref2 are inconsistent. Lastly, if we add the clonal mutations to the analysis (but exclude the known SNPs), there is still a significant trend for the expansion of TP53-inactivating mutations (p=0.03 in a one-tailed McNemar test for directionality). Guo and Xiong’s statement that they found “significantly shrinking inactivating subclonal mutations of TP53 in Cas9-cells, which means Cas9 also selects against TP53 inactivating mutations” (Abstract of 2) is therefore misleading. (We note that Guo and Xiong report that “four inactivating mutations from four cell lines were shrinking (P=0.039)”, but their manuscript does not provide any information about the statistical test that was applied to calculate significance.) 2) There is a potential sex-bias in our results. We did not test whether any of our results were affected by a potential sex bias. Given that p53 has an effect on X chromosome inactivation, we cannot rule out the possibility that sex may affect p53 signaling following Cas9 introduction. However, sex representation in our cell line cohort was very balanced, and Cas9-induced p53 activation and selection were found in both male and female lines. Of the 43 TP53-WT lines used for the gene expression analyses, 21 were female, 21 were male, and one was of unknown sex; of the 122 TP53-mutant lines, 62 were female, 59 were male, and one was of unknown sex. Moreover, we used TP53-WT cell lines from both sexes (3 male lines, 2 female lines, 1 of unknown sex) to validate p53 activation following Cas9 introduction, and detected p53 pathway activation in both the male and the female lines (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2 in ref1). Of the 10 cell lines in which a TP53 mutation was found to emerge or expand (Fig. 2c,d in ref1), 6 were female and 4 were male. Therefore, there is no evidence for any sex bias in these results. While Guo and Xiong raise an interesting hypothesis, they do not provide any real evidence that any of our results were indeed affected by sex bias. Instead, they make a few anecdotal statements on the matter: a) “The largest fold-change of p53 activation was observed in a female cell line (BT159)”. This is meaningless, as we tested the mRNA expression in 165 cell lines and protein expression in 9 cell lines. Guo and Xiong do not report any systematic comparison of the expression changes between male and female cell lines (although all of the data necessary for such analysis are available in our original paper). b) “There were more DNA damage foci in MCF7, which is a female cell line”. This assay was performed in only 3(!) cell lines, precluding any meaningful interpretation of sex bias. We also note that Cas9-induced p53 activation was actually mild in MCF7, compared to other male and female cell lines (Fig. 2e in 1), further weakening this particular anecdotal claim. c) “The largest TP53-inactivating subclonal mutations expanding or shrinking (293T, HCC1419, and OVK18) is seen in female lines”. This claim does not hold true if OVK18 is removed from the analysis. Moreover, according to Fig. 1a of ref2, 2 out 4 shrinking mutations and 4 out of 10 expanding mutations are actually seen in male lines, so the trend of mutations to expand or to shrink seems to be pretty sex-balanced. d) In the final paragraph of their manuscript, Guo and Xiong state that “We think the possible sex-biased effects of Cas9 may provide a possible reason for their failure to detect p53 activation in Cas9-expressing HCT116 (male) cells."" This is factually wrong. We found significant activation of p53 in HCT116 cells transduced with Cas9, as is clearly shown in Extended Data Fig. 2d and 2e of ref1. We note that the majority of the manuscript by Guo and Xiong (Fig. 1b-d, Supplementary Fig. S1-S4, Supplementary Table S1) is an analysis of sex bias in CRISPR screens, which does not directly pertain to our paper. Sex biases in CRISPR screens may have nothing to do with the Cas9-induced p53 signaling that we observed. Moreover, we compared CRISPR to shRNA screens and found significant differences associated with p53 mutation status (Fig. 5 in ref1). Guo and Xiong do not discuss this at all, nor do they provide any evidence that this analysis was affected by cell line sex bias. 3) TP53 mutation status of some cell lines is inaccurate in our paper. The Supplementary Note of 2 reads: ""We found that 11 cell lines (RERFLCAI, SISO, SNU761, COV644, COLO684, HS294T, G292CLONEA141B1, D283MED, G401, SJSA1, and SNU1041) used as TP53-WT (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Data 5 in ref.1) by Enache et al. actually have non-silent TP53 mutations (Supplementary Table S2), although this should not affect their conclusions."" There are 698 cell lines in Supplementary Data 5 and Fig. 5a, and we clearly did not validate the TP53 mutation status of each individually, but rather followed established annotations. There are several ways to classify TP53 mutation status in cell lines, and mutation calling algorithms constantly evolve. As described in our Methods section (ref1), we followed the annotations by Giacomelli et al. (ref4), which are based on the CCLE cell line annotations (ref5), according to which all of the 11 cell lines listed above are TP53-WT. These annotations have since been updated, however, and in the version downloaded by Guo and Xiong (22Q2, https://depmap,org/portal/), these cell lines are now classified as TP53-mutant. Importantly, exclusion of these cell lines has no effect on the outcome of the single analysis in which they were used (Fig. 5a in 1; p=8.8x10-6 instead of the original p=2.7x10-5; one-tailed t-test). Therefore, the slight discrepancy between the annotations used by us and those used by Guo and Xiong is irrelevant to the points that they raise. In summary, we thank Guo and Xiong for raising the intriguing possibility that sex may affect the cellular response to Cas9, in particular in the context of p53 pathway activation. However, this question remains open for now, as more research and data analysis are needed to determine whether this speculation is correct. References 1. Enache, O. & Rendo V. et al.

Review synthesized by Richa Arya. In the manuscript titled “Nanog organizes transcription bodies” Kuznetsova et al. discuss how the transcriptional bodies are assembled. They show that Nanog and Sox19b cluster before the transcription actually starts and initiate the formation of transcription bodies. The following comments and suggestions were raised to help strengthen the manuscript: 1. Result: RNA Pol II transcription localizes to two transcription bodies when zebrafish genome activates… The heading of the section is a bit confusing. Does it refer to the transcription of RNA pol II or transcripts of RNA pol II? Within the result section: ‘…as 64-cell stage… ’ Would be good for the reader to clarify that this is division number 6 to make it clearer that it is way earlier than what is reported in the previous sentence. ‘...productive transcription starts in two transcription bodies in the nucleus. These transcription bodies are isolated, large, long-lived, and appear at a predictable time during development… ’.  At this stage the study has reported localization data but not activity data (this is included later). The formation of clusters (which is what is detected) might suggest but cannot conclude about the activity of the enzyme or whether RNA is actually being produced. 2. Figure 1 ‘…the percentage of nuclei with at least one Pol II (Ser5P or Ser2P) cluster is indicated… ’. The injection is happening at the 1-cell stage. Then observations are made at the 64/128/256 cell stage. Are all the nuclei labelled at these stages? or only a subset? Recommend providing some clarification about the percentages reported? Are they a consequence of the embryo being mosaic, some cells containing the label injected at the 1-cell stage and some not? Or is it biological noise? Or a combination of both? Is this the ratio of (# of cells with puncta)/(total # of cells) or is it (# of cells with puncta)/(# of cells containing some labelled Pol II)? ' C. Tracks of transcription bodies at 64-, 128-, and 256-cell stage. The presence of Pol II Ser5P, Ser2P, or both, is indicated by red, blue, and white circles, respectively. Time on the x-axis in minutes after mitosis. ’. The sample size seems too small, can some clarification be provided to help with the interpretation of this data: In the first plot, one embryo is 64 cells. Even taking in consideration the fact that the embryo might be a mosaic with 50% of the cells labelled and that one can not image all of the cells due to the thickness of the sample, it should leave a few cells imaged per embryo (5-10 cells). It would be good if one experimental replication was made of multiple embryos injected in parallel. So, with all these considerations, the 20-ish tracks displayed on the first plots seem like a small number. If one experimental replicate is 3-4 embryos and 5 cells can be imaged per embryo then around 20 tracks would be the result of 1 replicate (vs 3 as indicated in the methods). If 10% of the cells can be imaged at 256-cell stage, with 3 replicates each made of multiple embryos, it would give more than 60-ish tracks. ‘ For wt, N=3, n=111; for mir430 mutant N=3, n=72… ’. Please clarify what the two n refer to in the figure legend? The methods state "" A minimum of 3 biological and 3 technical replicates was generated for each experiment. The number of experimental replicates (N) as well as the number of measured nuclei (n) are reported for each conducted experiment individually in the respective figure legend."" - Recommend including a shorter but similar clarification in the figure legend. 3. Result: Transcription factors cluster prior to, and independent of transcription ' and visualized each transcription factor in combination with the initiating form of RNA Pol II (Figure 2A, and Movies S4-6… ’ Suggest adding a clarification about when zygotic translation starts in zebrafish and whether translation starts before transcription in zygotes. ‘ We conclude that transcription factors cluster prior to, and independent of transcription elongation. ’ From the data it should be possible to estimate a mean delta T from TF clustering to Pol II clustering, it may be relevant to report such a number. 4. Figure 2: Pairwise non-parametric Wilcoxon tests: There is a concern about the use of a pairwise test as the two conditions CTRL and amanitin are two different conditions. 5. Result: RNA accumulation results in dissociation of transcription factor clusters ‘...the appearance of RNA Pol II Ser5P (initiation) clusters was also delayed in the absence of transcription elongation (Figure 2E)… ’. Suggest calculating the delta in time between TF cluster appearance and Pol II cluster (as suggested above). It appears the ""delay"" in the apparition of the Pol II puncta is the delay observed for the TF, which would indicate that with or without transcription Pol II joins the TF cluster at the same time. ‘…while accumulation of RNA causes them to dissolve… ’. Is this based on the observation that inhibition of transcription results in a longer cluster lifetime? RNA accumulation might promote clusters to dissolve, but whether it is the ""cause"" of their dissolution has not been tested. Recommend reframing the fragment to avoid conclusions about RNA accumulation. 6. Result: Nanog organizes transcription bodies '…cycle (Figure 3A)… '. There is a concern about comparing Nanog and Sox apparition time if they are not observed within the same embryo / nuclei. The present data are convolved by variations between embryos and between nuclei, recommend providing some clarification and looking at the time difference between each TF and the corresponding Pol II cluster. ‘...Nanog RNA Pol II Ser5P could still be detected… ’. Suggest re-phrasing this part as ""to determine if RNA Pol II Ser5P could still be detected in the absence of Nanog"". 7. Figure 3. ‘ In C-D, the percentage of nuclei with the indicated pattern is indicated… ’.  Suggest some further clarification about the percentages reported. In C does this indicate that 9 % of the cells form Sox clusters in absence of Nanog? And in D that 27 % of cells form Pol II clusters in absence of Nanog? If that is the case, recommend discussing it as it might impact the conclusion that Nanog is ""required"" for Pol II clustering. ' Pairwise non-parametric Wilcoxon tests were performed, ns indicates P > 0.05… '. Reconsider the use of pairwise tests, as noted above. 8. Figure 4 - ‘ percentages indicate how often the shown phenotype is observed. For D and E, N ≥ 3 and n ≥ 18. ’ - Please clarify how these percentages are calculated. Is this the percentage of nuclei with the described phenotype per embryo? Or the percentage of embryos with at least one nucleus with the depicted phenotype? In Figure 1 the percentage for Pol II in WT at 128-cell stage is 80%. Figure 4 reports 100%, is it evaluating the same thing? If it is preferable not to write exactly N and n values for all the conditions, maybe these could be shown in the figure itself. 9. Result: Nanog DBD as well as IDR are required to organize transcription bodies ‘ In this study we analyzed the assembly of two transcription bodies… ’. Recommend placing this under a separate Discussion/conclusions section. ‘…and RNA accumulates, transcription factor clusters disassemble. ’ It is not clear that the statement is supported by the data, consider reframing the fragment. 10.

Review synthesized by Michael Robichaux. The manuscript presents a cryo-electron microscopy focused study of a recombinant type V-K CRISPR-associated Cas12k transposon recruitment complex from Scytonema hofmanni that is DNA-bound and includes a complete R-loop formation. In addition to mapping the assembly and interactions within this transposon complex, the study also details the discovery of ribosomal protein S15 as an essential component for the transposition activity of the complex. The work presented in this manuscript may contribute to the development of new programmable CRISPR-associated genome-engineering tools in eukaryotic cells. Major comments - The figures in the manuscript are generally well-organized and clear. In particular, the 2D diagram of the Cas12k-TnsC complex in Figure 1A is a useful figure panel; however, please consider refining the diagram for readability by replacing the current nucleotide sequence rearrangement with simpler shapes or graphics. - For the structural complex models in Figure 2, please consider adding annotations that highlight both the completed R-loop as well as the 122॰ angled confirmation of the PAM distal to proximal DNA, which are both features that are highlighted in the Results section text. - The title for the “TniQ nucleates TnsC filament formation” Results section and the title for Figure 4 are both possibly overstated since these mechanistic conclusions are based solely on transposition assay results. - In the discussion, please consider revising the language used to describe the mechanism of transposon complex assembly (the model in Figure 7) to better justify a rationale for proposing a “cooperative” assembly mechanism that is based on the data in this manuscript, which is a structural assessment of the whole complex and its sub-complex interactions. Minor comments - In the first section of Results section, consider adding a description of the recombinant system used to purify the protein complex used for cryo-EM as done for the Figure 1 legend (“V-K CRISPR-associated transposon system from Scytonema hofmanni (Strecker et al., 2019)”). - For Figure S1B, the orientation map is not clear, an adjustment to the color contrast may improve the clarity of this panel. - For the cryo-EM data in Figures S2, please better define the TnsC oligomer organization (i.e., hexameric, variable). Also for Figure S2, please consider improving the image contrast for the angular distribution images in panel B. - For Figure S3, both the incomplete R-loop and the missing Cas12k-sgRNA + TsnC contacts described in the text for this non-productive complex structure are not evident or identifiable in the models presented in the figure. Please consider annotations or descriptions in the figure legend. - For Figure S4, please consider defining all rotations and dispositions that make up the conformational rearrangements in the RuvC domain, as described in the Results section text. - For Figure 2, please consider adding a 2D diagram of the current complex structure in comparison to previously-reported structural models. - The organization of Figure 3 is too busy, please consider re-formatting for clarity. - For Figure S8, please consider including a “zoomed-out” image of the Cas12k+S15 structure. - In the concluding paragraph of the Discussion section, please elaborate more on how the findings from this work may impact the “genome engineering application of CRISPR-associated transposons ”. Comments on reporting - As outlined in Figure S1, 75K particles were used for the final cryo-EM reconstruction of the Cas12k-TsnC recruitment complex. Please consider discussing the structural elements or discrepancies of the other classified particles. - Table S2 and S3 appear to be missing. - In the “TniQ recognizes tracrRNA and R-loop” Results section, please specify which TniQ and tracrRNA mutations reduced transposition activity. Suggestions for future studies Please consider future studies that address the relevance of this transposon complex structure to physiological processes via cell-based assays.",2022-08-03T10:50:51,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2022.06.17.496590,Structural basis for RNA-mediated assembly of type V CRISPR-associated transposons,"Michael Schmitz, Irma Querques, Seraina Oberli, Christelle Chanez, Martin Jinek",2022-06-17

Since the stems of stem-loop structures require parity (Chargaff’s second parity rule) this decreases the false alerting of immune mechanisms by double-stranded self RNAs (1-3). With their base parity less impaired than exons, structural constraints on introns should be less than those on exons. Thus, with more flexibility in the ordering of their bases, introns would seem to have a higher potential for structure. Indeed, Rangan et al. (4) report that yeast “introns include more non-random secondary structure elements compared to coding regions.” What could these structures be doing? They suggest there might have been evolutionary selection for regulatory elements: The widespread presence of structured elements in S. cerevisiae introns raises the possibility that similar motifs and stable secondary structures play a role in introns in higher-order eukaryotes, perhaps forming regulatory elements in human pre-mRNA. While this may be partially correct, it should be noted that eukaryotic pre-RNA structures reflect evolutionary pressures acting directly on both the DNA genomes from which RNAs are transcribed and the RNAs themselves (to ensure their proper functioning). The natural editing of RNA transcripts (pre-mRNA to mRNA) would have included both intron removal (as discussed by the authors) and the removal (or modification) of any exon structures that had primarily operated at the DNA level but were unacceptable at the RNA level. Thus, the structural landscapes of mature mRNAs reflect evolutionary pressures affecting both their cytoplasmic functions (e.g., protein-encoding and purine-loading) and the few (if any) remaining nuclear (DNA) level structural functions that happen to be acceptable (i.e., are neutral) at the mRNA level. It is a laudable goal to detail accurate RNA structures as they might operate within living cells (4). However, genome-level structure functions should not be forgotten. For this purpose, it is of fundamental interest to compare genes under negative Darwinian selection (slow mutation rate) with those under positive Darwinian selection (high mutation rate). In the latter case, protein-encoding functions in yeast should more effectively out-compete nucleic acid structure functions for a place in exons (3). Indeed, when genes under positive selection pressure were examined in higher-order eukaryotes, using computational methods similar to some the authors employ (5), it was found that the base order required for structured stem-loops was more constrained in exons (i.e, less structure). However, the base order required for local intron structures was less constrained (much more structure). Stem-loop potential in introns was conserved more than in exons (6). In other words, a dispersed genome-wide potential for structure - such as might be required to support recombination – seemed to have been diverted from exons to neighboring introns (7). If they have not already done so, I encourage the authors in their future work to compare intron structure landscapes in two classes of yeast genes – those conserved under negative selection and those subject to positive Darwinian selection. 1.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.08.487606v1#comment-5934804686,biorxivstage,1,"Summary: In this paper, the authors have employed Microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) to identify the positions of hydrogen atoms in hen egg-white lysozyme. The major success of the paper results from the continued improvement of MicroED data collection procedures: 35% of hydrogens contained in the structure can be visualized with visible hydrogen bonding networks and hydrogens on water molecules. They were able to locate more hydrogen atoms in the protein backbone than in the side chains owing to more rigidity of the backbone structure. They observe density for acidic side chain residues and their negatively charged side-chain carboxyl groups which are thought to be poorly resolved in single particle cryo-EM at moderate resolution. This observation is tantalizing, but incomplete. By our eye in Fig 2c the “right oxygen” in Asp18” is lower signal than the “left”. Presumably this indicates that the side chain is not protonated - and it is possible that there may be opportunities here to test the strength for “for negatively charged atoms at lower scattering angles” based on such differences in signal. Such an analysis would be very interesting (and potentially using different truncations of the data, truly test this model). The last section of the paper describes that the inter-nuclei distances are more accurate to determine the hydrogen bond lengths than the center of mass of electron clouds, which agrees with the analysis in Molprobity (Williams et al, Protein Science 2018). Comparison to X-ray (which occurs a bit in the discussion) and neutron data (e.g. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... on this point would be very interesting. Further missed opportunities include comparisons of the h signal strength to detection by neutron/X-ray and whether there are any trends that would connect with hydrogen-exchange measurements. Overall, the paper is concise and focuses on the observations enabled by the new data collection improvements, but misses opportunities to connect to other analyses on lysozyme (perhaps the best system to make such comparisons in!) Following are some minor points that we would like to mention: Minor points: Abstract line 18: instead of “informing” it should be “information” Line 61: “Here, hydrogen atoms were identified by omitting them from the model and inspecting the peaks in a calculated Fo–FC difference map following refinement in Servalcat based on crystallographic refinement routines implemented in REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 2011; Yamashita et al., 2021). Since resolution is a local feature in cryo-EM, the accuracy of hydrogen identification varies across the map.” There is some ambiguity in the way we read this. By “here” do the authors mean in the previous single particle EM work to high resolution outlined in the preceding sentences or their current manuscript? If they mean the preceding papers suggest starting the paragraph, “In those works,”; if they mean the current manuscript, the statement about resolution varying across the map needs a more full and nuanced explanation. Line 91: “Lowering the total exposure also reduces the effects of radiation damage that can affect the structural integrity of the protein and the ability to localize hydrogen atoms” It would be interesting to test the radiation damage directly here, but maybe prohibitive across 16 crystals? Line 110: ‘‘Nevertheless, these results are the most complete hydrogen bonding network visualized to date by macromolecular MicroED’’ The authors did a nice comparison of all the hydrogen bonds based on X-ray, MicroED and neutron diffraction. It would be worth mentioning if they were able to identify any new hydrogen bond position or network which was not previously reported, this would further connect to the other methods as mentioned above. Line 127-128: ‘‘Interestingly, whereas the Asp52 and Gly54 N-H distances are close to the idealized positions, the difference peak for the Asn44 N-H is located at an almost equal distance shared between the donor and Asp52 carbonyl acceptor’’ Which idealized positions are the authors referring to? idealized from the neutrons or X-ray or both? There may be settings in Phenix that allow this to be controlled (although REFMAC is used here). Line 182/183: ‘‘The number of observations for some 183 bond types is insufficient for a rigorous statistical analysis’’ The authors can mention which bond observations are significant and the observed bond length elongation. For example, C-H2 has the highest number of observations (99) with a deviation of 15. However, there is no mention for the apparent elongation of bond length in this case. Figure 2d: Label the contour level for the 2 additional water molecules w1079 and w1005. Figure 3: Legend needs explanation for MicroED curve too. Supplementary Table 1: We understand that the overall crystal quality statistics are weak in the case of MicroED. However, the low completeness after merging 16 datasets is not entirely understood and perhaps deserves some comment here. Is there a preferred orientation on the grid that leads to a systematic problem in filling reciprocal space?

We have missed valuable works of Turner et al. 2008 and Trampel et al 2011 while writing the initial version of our manuscript. Now we included them: “However, despite the rich variety of MRI contrasts acquired by the previous work (Barbier et al., 2002; Bollmann et al., 2022; Bridge et al., 2005; Budde et al., 2011; Dinse et al., 2015; Duyn et al., 2007; Federau & Gallichan, 2016; Fracasso et al., 2016; Kemper et al., 2018; Lüsebrink et al., 2021; Lüsebrink et al., 2017; Mattern et al., 2018; Petridou et al., 2010; Sanchez Panchuelo et al., 2021a; Sánchez-Panchuelo et al., 2012; Schira et al., 2022; Tardif et al., 2015; Trampel et al., 2011; Turner et al., 2008; Zwanenburg et al., 2011), there has been no openly accessible quantitative in vivo human T2* measurements at mesoscopic resolution (see Supplementary Table 1).” 1c. Considering the other reviews and comments we have received, we have decided to remove the mesoscopic analysis tool development discussion and novelty claims in our initial manuscript. We agree that such methods discussion is critical and deserves a separate detailed manuscript only focusing on the capabilities and challenges of various analysis strategies and algorithms. 2. We thank you for this detailed explanation. Now we more strongly claim “This structure is the stria of Gennari (Fulton, 1937; Gennari, 1782; Glickstein & Rizzolatti, 1984; Stüber et al., 2014)”. We have also now added a new sentence in the Discussion section: “Faster acquisitions leveraging e.g. echo planar imaging (Sanchez Panchuelo et al., 2021b) are especially needed for clinical populations”. 3. Thank you for this explanation and pointers. Following your advice, we now more strongly state state in Secion 5.1: “T1 contrast is clearly shown to be related to myelination (Leuze et al., 2017; Morawski et al., 2018) and therefore used for delineating areal borders (Cohen-Adad et al., 2012; Deistung et al., 2013; Dick et al., 2012; Dinse et al., 2015; Geyer et al., 2011; Haast et al., 2016; Marques et al., 2017; Sanchez Panchuelo et al., 2021b; Sánchez-Panchuelo et al., 2012).” 4. We have rectified our oversight by including these papers: “However, as argued within (Kuehn et al., 2017; Skeide et al., 2018; Wallace et al., 2016), mesoscopic in vivo imaging may still be insufficient to capture the subtle changes in myeloarchitecture aside from the primary visual cortex where layer IV is extremely thick”. 5. We are glad that you have brought up denoising. Yes, we did try multiple denoising techniques on our images to highlight different spatial features of our images such as layers and vessels. Our preliminary results are promising. However, considering the general criticism that we have received on the first version of our manuscript from other reviews and comments, we decided that detailed investigation of denoising our images is currently outside of the scope of our manuscript. We hope that these changes are sufficiently addressing your concerns, comments and questions.

To compare our dataset to other state-of-the-art methods we included Supplementary Table 1. It can be seen that, for the last decade, there has not been any mesoscopic T2* imaging. It seems that Budde et al 2011 (at 9.4 T) and Sanchez-Panchuelo et al 2012 (at 7 T) were the last times mesoscopic (<0.5 mm in at least two voxel dimensions) T2* values were measured. Therefore, in combination with other reviews and comments we have received, we have decided to solely focusing on reporting our T2* data. To keep the scope of our manuscript focused, we have decided to leave detailed SNR and CNR analyses for measuring the effectiveness of our blood motion artifact mitigation method for a future manuscript. 2. Although we did not encounter problems downloading our data from OSF, we decided to upload our data to an additional server. We are going to add this new link in the next iteration of our manuscript. For the time being we decided to not rework on our analysis pipelines by incorporating Jupyter notebooks and containers because two users from different institutes had no problem performing similar data acquisition and using our analysis script on their datasets. Based on this, we concluded that our analysis documentation is satisfactory for now. However, we are going to consider this advice in our next project. 3. We have added figure legends to Figure 1 (but forgot to compile with this new version in the last moment before updating bioRxiv, so the updated Figure 1 can be seen here). More substantially, now we provide Supplementary Figures 3 and 4 to qualitatively show the image stability across runs. In addition, we have downgraded the position and importance of our MP2RAGE T1 dataset in our manuscript. Now we state in section 2.2.2: “These T1 data were acquired primarily for cortical gray matter segmentation purposes and were not intended to serve as quantitative T1 measurement”. Also, now we report the MP2RAGE T1 results in Appendix A rather than within the main text with a disclaimer: “We highlight that our primary focus for acquiring the T 1 contrast was for cortical gray matter segmentation. Therefore, we have used a speed-optimized MP2RAGE sequence that provided good contrasts for cortical segmentation purposes. However, we believe that there could be some value in reporting our findings”. As a note, we did acquire field maps (considering Marques and Gruetter 2013) but did not use them as we are now not focusing on T1 quantification. However, although only visually, it can be seen that the scan-rescan similarity of our imager seems high in Supplementary Figures 3 and 4. These MP2RAGE T1 images served us very well during tissue segmentation. 4. The reason behind 6/8 partial fourier in MP2RAGE was to shorten our single data acquisition run durations to be able to get more repetitions. We have chosen this strategy during piloting because single run MP2RAGE images were visibly more noisy compared to our ME GRE images (see Supplementary Figure 3 and 4). We did mention our Bandwidth in Table 1 (250 Hz/Px under MP2RAGE column) in the initial version of our manuscript. However this information was missing from the “Data Acquisition” text. Now we have fixed this oversight. For our discussion section, now we added the sentence “Faster acquisitions leveraging e.g. echo planar imaging (Sanchez Panchuelo et al., 2021b) are especially needed for clinical populations.”. EPI is proven to be a big time saver that comes at a cost of image distortions and larger sampling time windows that can cause mixing of T2* signal sampled over longer durations. We have addressed the minor points. Not mentioning the manufacturer or the field strength was an oversight. Now we mention “using 7T MRI (Siemens) with a 32-channel Rx head coil (Nova)” in the data acquisition section. We have also updated our title to mention the field strength: “Mesoscopic in vivo human T2* dataset acquired using quantitative MRI at 7 Tesla”.",2022-07-30T17:09:38,omerfarukgulban,Omer Faruk Gulban,10.1101/2021.11.25.470023,Mesoscopic Quantification of Cortical Architecture in the Living Human Brain,"Omer Faruk Gulban, Saskia Bollmann, Renzo Huber, Konrad Wagstyl, Rainer Goebel, Benedikt A.

Review synthesized by Vasanthanarayan Murugesan. In this preprint, the authors describe a novel pathway that maintains protein homeostasis in cells recovering from heat stress termed stress-induced protein disaggregase activation pathway (siDAP). siDAP induces the DNAJA1+DNAJB1-Hsp70 protein disaggregase and targets aggregates of tightly misfolded proteins. This pathway is distinct from more-known ubiquitin-dependent quality control and works in sequence with it. Further, the authors show that this pathway is compromised in aging cells. The authors have provided a wealth of convincing data to support the claims made. The following items were raised: Major comments Manuscript It is recommended to revise the manuscript to better integrate the data and the text. The paper provides extensive data to support the study claims, but further background material for the experiments in the introductory or results section would support interpretation e.g., concepts required to understand the final two figures are not discussed in the introduction. Reducing the number of supplementary figures may make the manuscript easier to follow and help in tightening the narrative. Experiments Results ‘ Immediately after HS, DNAJA1 and DNAJB1 rapidly relocalized to nucleoli’ - It is unclear from the DAPI stain what happens to the nucleolus at 0h after HS. It seems to be present in some cells but not all. Could a marker of the nucleolus be used and/or some clarification included? Results ‘ This suggests that predominantly newly synthesized DNAJA1 and DNAJB1 molecules drive the assemblage of the DNAJA1+DNAJB1-Hsp70 disaggregase in cells after HS ’ - Fig S5D shows that B1 forms puncta after HS even in CHX treated cells, which suggests that protein synthesis is not needed. Can some clarification be added for this fragment. Results ‘ diffuse GFP fluorescent signal (cyan) indicating that protein aggregates were largely absent ’ - The presence of aggregates or puncta before HS cannot be ruled out, the puncta or aggregate could be too small to be resolved. Recommend commenting on this. Results ‘ Blocking Hsp70 activity by VER-155008 also caused DNAJA1+DNAJB1 scaffolds to persist up to 24h after HS, presumably due to their continuous association with the aggregates (Figure 2D). ’ - The HSP70 aggregates look different after treatment with VER, they look more like the A1/B1 puncta than in the DMSO condition, it may be worth commenting on this. In Figure 6, the distinction between biological aging and replicative aging could be stated more clearly. Cell lines derived from donors of different biological ages form siDAP puncta and recover from heat shock. However, the cells lose this ability when cultured in dishes at passage 12 or 18 irrespective of biological age. Hence it is not clear if passaging cells mimics biological aging with regard to protein homeostasis. Minor comments Figure 1H: Recommend including some comments on why the size of HSF is more at 0 hr, and commenting on whether HSF-1 depletion changes HSP70 levels. Figure 2 (B-D) - The size of cells in U vs 0 hour appear different, the 0 hr cells look bigger. Suggest adding a scale bar and clarification on whether the magnification is the same. In Figure S4/S5, it is hard to infer the state of the nucleolus during stress with DAPI staining and subsequently the localization of DNAJA1 and DNAJB1 to the nucleolus is not clear. In Figure S4D, it is shown that CHX doesn’t affect the formation of puncta but the text states that newly synthesized DNAJA1 and DNAJB1 are required for the assembly of DNAJA1-DNAJB1-HSP70. Please provide some clarification for this contradiction. In Fig S8, statistical analysis of different siDAP induction is suggested. In Fig 3, please provide clarification for the choice of experiments in CHX-treated cells for testing the effect of VER-155008. In Fig 5, the caption mentions cells with/without VER-155008 treatment which cannot be seen in the figure. ‘ In fact, we found that human cells can tune the activation of siDAP according to the level of protein damage sustained after HS ’ - It may be informative to check if the cytotoxicity levels differ from HS at 39ºC and at 42ºC. In Fig 6, quantification of PLA^Dt, similar to Fig 1F is suggested. Please also report the conditions used for heat shock in these experiments, 42oC for 2 hrs? ‘ Moreover, siDAP was fully active in all fibroblast lines tested (Figure 6A; Figure S22A and B). Similar to immortalized HeLa cells, primary dermal fibroblasts only induced the DNAJA1+DNAJB1 JDP scaffold after HS (Figure S22C) ’ -  May be worth mentioning that the apparently higher intensity of the fluorescence signal in the cells derived from aged subjects. The fluorescence signal per cell looks much greater in 70 yo (Fig. S22 only) and 75 yo (Figs. 6 and S22). The next few lines discuss the relevance of decreased fluorescence (representative of loss of siDAP induction) with serial passaging/replicative age. However, upon HS, siDAP signal seems to go up with chronological age, but then in the replicative aging experiments, siDAP is lost quickly. Discussion ‘ There is some evidence to suggest that cellular surveillance systems that usually keep protein aggregation in check deteriorate during aging…. ’ - There may be some conflation of biological aging and ""replicative aging"".  There seemed to be conflicting results when looking at differently biologically aged samples, which may affect interpretation of whether replicative aging in a dish recapitulates aging processes. Methods Cell culture - Please provide further information about the age and other details for the 6 primary fibroblast cell lines.

Review synthesized by Bianca Trovò. Antibody-based technologies for the detection and quantification of analytes in complex biological samples present challenges regarding the infrastructure and chemical modifications involved. There is therefore interest in developing alternative biosensor platforms that leverage split luciferase enzymes. Single-component luminescent biosensors can be more easily produced and work in both homogenous and immobilized assay formats. The manuscript reports the design of BAT, a single-component, NanoLuc-based, Binding Activated Tandem split enzyme biosensor for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in multiple assay formats. The reviewers praised the efficiency and practical value of the reporter system described, as the reporter protein works even in crude bacterial cell lysate, as well as the novelty of the mechanism of action for the reporter system. A few comments and suggestions raised are outlined below. Major comments - In the introduction, the manuscript mentions the single-component, NanoLuc-based, Binding Activated Tandem split enzyme (BAT) biosensor, which is said to “ not rely on a large conformational change in the binding module or competition with a tethered decoy as with other single component platforms ”. The manuscript argues for the uniqueness and generality of the BAT approach based on a mechanism that does not rely on conformational change. Further references and explanation for the mode of action would be helpful to support the argument. Given the lack of conformational change in the binding module, can an explanation be included for what causes the split components to come closer and reconstitute again? - Results, Design and optimization of SARS-CoV-2 biosensor “S-BAT”: the explanation of Figure 1a and Figure S1f provided in the context of the model for the mechanism of BATs could be strengthened with crystal diffraction data to validate the hypothesis, especially for clarifying how steric hindrance occurs when binding with the antigen (although this will not elucidate any conformational change happening in LCB1 upon binding). - Results, Design and optimization of SARS-CoV-2 biosensor “S-BAT”: the manuscript reports a full mutational analysis, or deep mutational scanning (DMS) leading to the generation of “ a point mutant in the S-BAT binding module at Asp30 (“S-BAT*”), designed to ablate salt bridges formed with Lys417 and Arg403 in the Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) ”. Would it be possible to have this mutation motivated in the manuscript, and why was it chosen over other possible mutations in that context? - Results, Design and optimization of SARS-CoV-2 biosensor “S-BAT”: the statement that “the absence of a hook effect at super-stoichiometric concentrations of Spike binding sites to sensor copies supports a predominantly cis activation mechanism ” is a strong point but further clarification on this point is recommended, for example, further context on the Hook effect, and what would have been expected if trans activation was the major mode of action. - Discussion: the manuscript has shown different versions of the same assay, so a discussion on advantages of one version over the other would be important. Minor comments - Results, Design and optimization of SARS-CoV-2 biosensor “ S-BAT”: “In addition to having high thermal stability, rigidity, and no disulfide bonds to complicate purification ” - Please clarify which protein these qualities refer to. - Results, Design and optimization of SARS-CoV-2 biosensor “S-BAT”: “ This suggests that cis activation is likely the predominant source of signal in the assay, but we cannot rule out the contribution of a trans activating mechanism. In the trans mechanism, simultaneous binding to multiple protomers in a single Spike might increase the effective concentration, driving activation. ” - Please provide further comments on the cis and trans mechanisms. - Results, S-BAT is functional in multiple assay formats: “ Adsorption-based immobilization is advantageous in that it requires no chemical modification to the protein reagent ”, recommend reporting the efficiency of this step and how much signal is left after the washing steps. - Methods, Cloning: the manuscript reports that all BAT constructs were subcloned using NcoI and BamHI restriction sites via Gibson assembly. Restriction site cloning and Gibson assembly seem to be two orthogonal methods, suggest providing further information on the cloning procedure. - Methods, Recombinant Protein Production: "" The un-cleaved BAT sensors were concentrated to ∼1.0 mL, and the concentration was calculated from the A280 value ”. It is unclear if this was done using highly pure imidazole or if the signal was subtracted from Imidazole? A280 quantification is known to be difficult with Imidazole present. - In Figure 1c: “ Performance (Signal to Noise (S/N) multiplied by the magnitude of signal change (S-N)) ” please provide the mathematical expression for this analysis",2022-07-29T11:32:47,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2022.06.15.496006,A single-component luminescent biosensor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"Matthew Ravalin, Heegwang Roh, Rahul Suryawanshi, G.

It would be interesting to compare them but it seems to me, there is not significant difference in the infection of the TTMV-Ly1, Ly2, Ly3 viral particles (Figure 45). I looked at the TTMV-Ly2 because it has two characteristic repeats in the 5’-noncoding region, the second repeat was probably created by the insertion of about 66nts (insert: gccggaaaaccacataatttgcatggctaaccacaaactgatatgctaattaacttccacaaaaca).

I especially like Figure 3 where the authors compare the severity of partial knock down of SEPTIN9 with siRNA vs in the knock-out CRISPR cell line. The complete lack of cilia in Figure 3J/K is very striking. The experiments using centrin-fused RhoA and ARHGEF18 are very creative. It is impressive how long the cilia are in Figure 5D! I find it interesting that expressing the Centrin-GFP-DHPH construct doesn’t cause the same long cilia phenotype in the Septin9 KO cells. This observation is based on the images shown in the panels because I do not see cilia length measured in Septin9KO + Centrin-GFP-DHPH. I appreciate the use of scatter plots to highlight the variability/reproducibility of the data. I assume the different colors relate to different replicates, but this is not clearly stated. I have a few specific comments with regards to Figure 7: I found it difficult to see the 3 RPGRIP1L puncta. I think if the panels were more zoomed in or larger it would help to better highlight the shift from 3 to 2 puncta in the Septin9 KO cells. In the Septin9 KO cells RPGRIP1L and TCTN2 staining was not observed at the transition zone. This observation is not surprising since the Septin9 KO cells do not have cilia (Figure 3J/K). As such, I do not believe that the conclusion that Septin9 “mediates the localization of transition zone components to the ciliary base” is founded. Septin9 could have a function early in ciliogenesis that is not necessarily specific to mediating the localization of transition zone components. Perhaps this could be better resolved in the Septin9 siRNA knock down where short cilia are present. The data showing that expression of constitutively active RhoA restores RPGRIP1L and TCTN2 at the transition zone (7I,7J,7M,7N) is very nice and consistent with this construct restoring cilia in the Septin9 KO. However, I think the data in 7M and 7N would be clearer if you included the Sept9 KO data on this graph. One last point – Figures 7A, 7B, and the inset on 7C state RPGRIP1 while the text only refers to RPGRIP1L. The Materials and Methods do not mention which antibody was used so I am not clear which protein was the focus of this study. Similarily, I think it is a typo in 7F and the Figure 7 legend where it says TCTN1.",2022-07-27T14:46:46,KarenL_PhD,Karen Lange,10.1101/2022.05.20.492811,Septin-Mediated RhoA Activation Engages the Exocyst Complex to Recruit the Cilium Transition Zone,"Darya Safavian, Moshe S.

Using the BH3 swap mutants is nice, but does not tell you much about the activity of the full-length (endogenous) protein. You may be aware that the ""BH3-only"" version of BCL-G is barely expressed in most cells and the version with BH2 & BH3 domain is much more abundant (PMID_23059823). So, studying the BH3 domain in isolation appears somewhat artificial to me. Also, in the CT26 xenotransplant experiment you show would benefit from overexpressing a BH3_mut version of BNIP5 and some data that documents it is really impaired BAK-dependent cell death that gives the growth advantage.....there could be many alternative explanations. So, comparing CT26 lacking Bax or Bak ± BNIP5 wt vs. mut would be a strong experiment to test your hypotheses.

The manuscript reports an increase in pHi at the G2/M transition, decreased pHi at the G1/S boundary, S/G2 boundary, and prior to division, and increases during mid-S phase and G2, and suggests that pHi dynamics are necessary for cell cycle progression. The reviewers praised the topic of the study, measuring intracellular pH during the cell cycle and looking at the heterogeneity between cells are both important questions. However, there were some  questions raised about the methodology as well as the interpretation of the data, as outlined below. Comments about methodology The pH sensor used in the study has been used previously but the single-cell level use requires new types of control and validations. It would be relevant to report: - What is the measurement error? - How efficient is the permeabilization protocol? - How homogeneous is the expression of the sensor? How does the expression level impact the pHi readout? These technical parameters could explain the heterogeneity in pHi reported in Figures 1,2,3, and they are relevant to understand if the fluctuations reported are relevant biologically or at the level of technical variability. Recommend providing additional details on the methodology for single cell pHi measurements, to ensure the experiments can be fully reproduced. Please report sample sizes. There is apparent intra-cellular heterogeneity present within each cell. The text should highlight whether the cytoplasm is heterogenous in pH. The study uses a single ROI per cell to measure intracellular pHi, however, if the cytoplasm is heterogeneous as some images show, the location of the ROI can influence the readout. It is recommended to use image analysis tools to segment cells and use the whole signal rather than a selected portion. There are concerns about the statistical analysis for several figures (including Figs 2I, 3I, and 5), in particular regarding the calculation of p-values based on multiple measurements or cells within each sample. The t-test and ANOVA assume that each measurement is independent, while multiple nuclei within the same sample are not independent. Recommend not reporting p-values or averaging together the values from each sample and then calculate the p-value using those sample-level means. For more information, see https://doi.org/10.1371/jou... and https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb... The median is used as the reporter of the populations, the context for this choice is unclear. There are concerns about reporting standard deviation to estimate the spread around the median. Specific comments Introduction ‘In normal cells, intracellular pH (pHi) is near neutral (∼7.2)... ’ - Could the text specify the type of cells the statement relates to, does it apply to all eukaryotes, mammalian cells, or even more specific and only demonstrated for human cells? Results ‘ single-cell standardization is performed using buffers of known pH containing the protonophore nigericin (Fig. 1A, see methods for details). ’ - The experiments use two pH extremes (~6.7 and 7.7 per the Materials & Methods)) and assume a linear relationship of the emission ratio between these extremes. Is this linear relationship verified? The supplementary Fig S2. shows an increase in signal across just two points. Suggest presenting an analysis of the biosensor across 4-5 different pH points to demonstrate linearity and dynamic range within the first set of figures. Plotting the ratio as well as the fluorescence intensities of individual channels across these pH ranges would also be relevant. Figure 1 - Is there an explanation for the signal from the nucleus? It seems initially more acidic than the cytoplasm and then it does not change as much as the cytoplasm during the nigericin treatment. Is this due to bad permeabilization? - ‘ B) NL20, C) A549, and D) H1299’ - Please indicate which cells are normal and which cancerous. - ‘ E-G) Histograms of single-cell pHi in E) NL20 (n=173, 3 biological replicates), F) A549 (n=424, 4 biological replicates), and G) H1299 (n=315, 3 biological replicates). ’ - The distributions are aggregates of 3 or 4 biological replicates. What do the distributions look like in each replicate? Are the differences between conditions visible? If the E, F and G histograms are generated using data pooled from different replicates, recommend separating the replicates and presenting the distributions separately for each replicate experiment. ‘ We next measured single-cell pHi in individual NL20-mCh-pHl (Fig. 1B), A549-mCh-pHl (Fig. 1C), and H1299-mCh-pHl (Fig. 1D) cells ’ - From the methods: ""Individual Regions of Interest (ROI) are drawn for each cell in each condition (initial, high pH nigericin, and low pH nigericin), and mCherry aggregates are removed using thresholding holes."" From the cells in the image, it appears that the cytoplasmic signal is not homogenous and suggests that the choice of ROI will affect the reading for each cell. In this condition, to do single cell measurements, it is recommended to use the signal from the entire cell (cytoplasm) rather than using an ROI. ‘ Representative pHluorin and mCherry channels and single-cell standardization lines can be found in Fig. S2 ’ - The pH probe appears to be comprised of a straight fusion between the pH sensitive GFP (pHluorin) and pH insensitive mCherry. One would expect that the ratio of GFP to mCherry is only determined by pH (and not by expression level or excitation intensity). A question arises around the dynamic range (shown in fig. S2) being different between the different cell lines. For instance, the ratios observed for pH=7 and pH=7.8 are 3 and 8 for NL20, 3 and 5 for A549, and 0.5 and 2 for H1299. Can an explanation be provided  for the differences between cell lines? Were the single cell measurements verified with a dye (BCECF/SNARF/SNAFL)? Was the permeabilization protocol validated? ‘ (NL20-mCh-pHl) (Fig. 1E; 7.42±0.07). ’ - The first sentence of the results section indicates ""In normal epithelial cells, pHi is near neutral (∼7.2), while cancer cells have a constitutively increased pHi (pHi>7.4)."" According to this statement, the NL20 cell line has a pHi corresponding to cancer cells, can this be clarified? ‘ These data show the advantages of measuring single-cell pHi under physiological culture conditions that match population averages, but also provide pHi distributions lost at the population level. ’ - The single cell data reveal the heterogeneity, can further explanation be provided for the advantage gained by these data over bulk measurements? ‘ These data also show that pHi is heterogeneous even in clonal, genetically identical, cell lines, suggesting pHi may be a biomarker for non-genetic cell phenotype ’ - The data show heterogeneity, but do not address how much and what the source of heterogeneity is. It would be helpful to: report the error on the measurement, compare the spread of pHi to something else to get a sense of the normal level of noise in the measurement. Could this be compared to the spread of mCherry intensity, to check if there is more spread in pHi than in expression level of the construct. Independent measurement of the heterogeneity of the pH (e.g. with another probe/dye) would shed some light. The heterogeneity (or spread) of basal biosensor distributions could be compared against the distributions achieved after nigericin treatment - to bring out the differences in biological heterogeneity versus measurement error.  The results could then further elaborate on whether the biological heterogeneity has relevance in the regulation of cellular processes. ‘ pHi in physiological environments ’ - Can some clarification be provided for how prior studies did not follow physiological conditions, while the current set up would provide such physiological conditions? ‘ We synchronized H1299-mCh-pHl cells using Palbociclib’ - The study uses H1299 line in most figures hereafter, A549 line in some while not the NL-20 lung cells, can some justification be provided for the selection of cell lines for specific experiments. ‘ In this representative replicate, we observed single-cell pHi significantly decreased between 0 and 4 h, significantly increased between 4 and 8 h, decreased between 8 and 12 h, and increased again between 12 and 24 h (Fig. 2D).’ - It is not clear whether these data are consistent with the other replicates (Figure S3). For example, another replicate shows a consistent decrease of pHi between 0-4h and 4-8h, which is not the case for the example shown in the main figure. Can some clarification be added about discrepancies between replicates. In Figure S3 the different time points were statistically compared to their previous time point, can the same statistical analysis be applied to the replicate in Figure 2? Figure 2 ‘Box and whisker plots of F) cyclin E1, G) cyclin A2, and H) cyclin B1 immunoblot data across 3 biological replicates’ - There is a concern about the use of boxplots for n=3 as they summarize the data into 5 statistics (2x whiskers, Q1, Q3 and the median): www.nature.com/articles/nme.... It is recommended to show the individual data with a dotplot. ‘ Figure 2I. Violin plots of raw pHi across 3 biological replicates ’ - A superplot is recommended for identifying the biological vs. technical replicates: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.... The significance should be determined based on n=3 (not on the pooled technical replicates). ‘ Cyclin immunoblots and pHi agreed across 3 biological replicates, and additional blots are shown in Fig. S3.’ -The replicates from Fig. S3 and Fig. 2 do not appear to show a clear behavior. For example at 4h, two replicates show a decrease while the third shows an increase in pHi. Could some clarification be added for this? ‘ When pHi measurements on Palbociclib-treated cells were compared over three biological replicates, we found that pHi significantly decreased at the G1/S transition (4 h, 7.75±0.15) and in late S phase (12 h, 7.69±0.09), significantly increased at G2/M (24 h, 7.82±0.11) (Fig. 2I), and then significantly decreased once more at the end of the experiment in asynchronous cells (36 h, 7.67±0.10) (Fig. 2I). ’ - The population in Fig 1 shows a large spread from around 7.4 to 8. This emcopasses all the distribution shown in Fig 2 and if the individual time points are undersampled, small fluctuations are expected in the mean and the median. Can some comment be provided about the potential influence of undersampling on the fluctuation? If the fluctuations were due to undersampling they would be random and could explain why the replicates are not in very good agreement. Also, can some clarification be added about how many cells were measured in each time point. Figure 3 - The various replicates provided here and in Sup. Fig. 4 show variability. For example, only the replicate in the main figure shows a decrease at 4h and 12h. The third and fourth replicates are in good agreement and for those pHi stays roughly the same and then drops between 12h and 24h. Should this be reflected in the text? From the values on the y axis for each time point and replicate, it seems that the sample size varies between replicates. There is the risk of undersampling, and also that if one replicate contains much more cells than others, it would dominate the distributions once the data are pulled together. Can the sample size for each time point and replicates be reported? ‘ and decreases at 12 h and 24 h (Fig. S5B-C) ’ - The text previously reported that pHi increased between 12 and 24h for H1299 cells, here it reports that there is a decrease at 24h. Please provide a clarification. ‘ we established a time-lapse approach to track pHi dynamics over an entire cell cycle in a single cell. ’ - This is a robust approach to detect pH changes over time. ‘w e selected prophase as a “normalization point” for each individual dividing cell ’ - Recommend referring to ""synchronization point"" instead of ‘normalization’. Figure 4 The paper shows that synchronization alters baseline pHi. Could a similar experiment be completed without synchronization? ‘A) Representative stills of Video S1 of a dividing H1299-mCh-pHl cell at indicated time (h) ’ - It would be good to compare this to the metastatic cells used to establish how much of the pHi fluctuations observed during the cell cycle are ""cancer"" related. ‘ Furthermore, the pHluorin increases observed over time in dividing cells are not correlated with increased mCherry fluorescence, which indicates pHluorin increases are not due to increases in biosensor expression (Fig. S8B-C).’ - It is great that this measurement was completed. However, from the plots provided Sup. Fig. 8 B and C, in dividers and non-dividers, it looks like the two signals (mCh intensity and pHluorin) are well correlated (first a decrease for a few hours, then it rises until 10h then it decreases). Could this indicate that the readout is influenced by protein concentration / expression? Suggest plotting the two signals vs each other’s on a scatter plot and formally testing for correlation. Figure 5 For the FUCCI reporter, plotting mVenus and mCherry intensities normalized between the max and min value for each cell allows clear identification of transition between phases. It may be helpful to present example single cell traces from 5-10 cells for each treatment, to more clearly appreciate the cell cycle phase transitions and their durations on panels F,G and H. ‘D) Single-cell pHi of H1299-FUCCI cells treated with EIPA and SO859 (E+S, n=233) to lower pHi, untreated (CRL, n=267), or treated with ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, n=202) to raise pHi (see methods for details) ‘ - Please clarify how or when delta pHi was calculated for data in Fig. 5D. ‘ previous work in lower- order organisms ’ - ""lower-order"" has a negative connotation, please consider re-phrasing to include the species or at least family of organisms. Discussion - Recommend further discussion about altered progression through cell cycle phases at different pHi and how it could be altered in cancer cells. Is increased intracellular pH in cancer cells related in any way to their increased proliferation? If so, which cell cycle steps are affected? High intracellular pH seems to elongate all phases except the M phase. Methods ‘ Multiple Z-planes were collected with the center focal plane maintained using a Perfect Focus System (PFS). ’ - Please report whether pH was analyzed on a projection, a single z-slice, each z-slice? Single-cell pHi measurements - Please provide additional detail for the protocol for the single cell pHi measurement. Include information on whether the work involves single image, stacks, projections, etc, and the size and location of the ROIs. Please also provide further context for the ""mCherry aggregates"", does this mean the construct is cleaved and the mCh aggregate? Does the GFP aggregate too? NIS Analysis Software//GraphPad Prism - Please report the version of the software used. ‘ Individual Regions of Interest (ROI) are drawn for each cell in each condition’ - Could the ROI on a few of the cells be drawn and highlighted in the main figures to show the size and location of the ROI? ‘8% laser power for GFP; 700 ms exposure time and 10% laser power for TxRed; and 100 ms exposure time and 5% laser power DAPI’ - Please report the exact wavelengths used to excite the fluorophore, (e.g. 8% power of a 488 laser (GFP excitation)). Supplementary figures Figure S3 panel A - Should the calibration slope be the same for every cell? Can some explanation be provided for why some cells have a steeper slope than others? Figure S4 - Replicates appear to show different trends in pHi and Cyclins, which makes it difficult to interpret the data. Figure S8 panel A - This plot shows correlation between the two quantities, they both rise and fall at the same time.

Review synthesized by Ehssan Moglad. Study conducted by Chieh-Ren Hsia et al. which looked at nuclear deformation in confined migration and its effect in chromatin organization and function. Major comments Results ‘ To distinguish between true changes in chromatin modifications and effects of physical compression of the nuclear content due to deformation, we normalized the heterochromatin mark intensity to the euchromatin mark intensity in each cell.’ - The results are normalized to H3K9ac, with the assumption that its levels do not change during migration/confinement. Has this assumption been confirmed? For example, by normalizing both H3K27me3 and H3K9ac to total H3 instead - and showing that K27me3 increases with confined migration while H3K9ac doesn't. Results ‘I ncreased heterochromatin formation should result in an increased ratio of heterochromatin marks to euchromatin marks, whereas physical compression of chromatin would increase both marks, and thus not alter their ratio…’ - Can some comments be provided on what the meaning would be for heterochromatin to ""increase"" and euchromatin to not change? There are two ways in which heterochromatin could ""increase"" - either the portion of the genome in heterochromatin could increase (which would mean the portion in euchromatin would decrease), or the portion of the genome in heterochromatin could stay the same but K27me3 levels could be higher in those regions (which might not affect euchromatin levels). One way to distinguish between these would be to stain for K36me3 as the ""euchromatin"" marker instead of K9ac - because K36me3 and K27me3 are mutually exclusive. Figure 1 - Could the effects seen be due to cells spending different amounts of time in the channels? Do all cells migrate at a similar speed? - Panels D, F, I: it is unclear if the cells shown in the plot for the change in heterochromatin marks are all that migrated or only those that show the difference. Suggest including a dot plot to also show individual data. Can some clarification be provided for how to interpret that controls ""before"" in 1D and 1F are statistically different? Counts in Fig S2A-D are sometimes very low (same applies to Fig 1I, Fig 2B,C,E.), it may be nice to compare some more cells. Results ‘ Although the effect was less pronounced than in the ≤2×5 μm2 confined channels (Fig. 1C-F)’ - Can the normal size of these cells be reported ? Also the size of nuclei. is it bigger than the pore size? There are concerns about the statistical analysis related to SEM and p-values based on multiple measurements or cells within each sample. The t-test and ANOVA assume that each measurement is independent, and multiple cells within the same sample are not independent. Suggest to either not report p-values or average together the values from each sample and calculate the p-value using those sample-level means. For more information, see https://doi.org/10.1371/jou... and https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb... Minor comments Results ‘custom-made polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices with precisely defined constrictions that mimic interstitial space’ - The manuscript report the size of the channels, and notes that it mimics interstitial spaces, it would be helpful to also report the size range for interstitial spaces in vivo. Figure IH: Are these the same cells as in the reference (cells in which vertical confinement is sufficient to induce a nuclear response)? Are 5 um channels squeezing the nucleous? “significantly larger increase in heterochromatin than cells migrating through the 10-μm tall channels (Fig. 1H, I), demonstrating that the observed effect is primarily attributed to the confinement and not the migration process per se” - There is a statistical difference between the confined migration and non-confined migration groups, but there is also a statistically significant increase in heterochromatin in the non-confined migration group compared to baseline (and with larger sample sizes than in the confined group), so it may be worth commenting on the possibility of the effect of migration alone. “Cells maintained CMiH even after completing at least one round of mitosis, without any trend of reversion in their heterochromatin levels (Fig. 2C; Fig. S4A, B), suggesting that the epigenetic modifications were inheritable through DNA replications ” - This is an intriguing concept, however, it is unclear whether the cells that migrated did so before or after dividing. To support the claim about inheriting CMiH, it would be relevant to see heterochromatin levels in a mother cell increase after it squeezes through a channel, then the daughter cell (which doesn't squeeze through a channel) having a higher heterochromatin level than the ""before"" cells. That's not possible with immunofluorescence, maybe the GFP-HP1a could be useful for such a live-imaging approach? Otherwise, if all these ""mitotic cells"" divided after squeezing through a channel, that could be stated in the text, legend, and/or methods. Alternatively, the conclusion could be nuanced/toned down. Figure 3 - The number of samples analyzed in some cases appears small.

Review synthesized by Ruchika Bajaj. This study has characterized the function of Hero proteins in improving the recombinant expression of TAR DNA-binding protein in E. coli and restoration of enzymatic activity of firefly luciferase during heat and stress conditions. This study may be useful for future applications of Hero proteins in life sciences research. Please see below a few points offered as suggestions to help improve the study. - In introduction, 3rd paragraph, in context with “amino acid composition and length of Hero proteins”, please elaborate on the effect of these two factors on the function and stability of hero proteins. - The manuscript refers to “cis and trans” terms on several occassions. Please explain these terms in context with the association of Hero protein with the target proteins. - Introduction - A paragraph describing the origin of Hero proteins and the differences between the types of Hero proteins in the introduction section would be helpful for readers to understand the background on these proteins. For example, please explain the background on naming these proteins as Hero 7, 9, 11 etc. The genes SERF2, C9orf16, C19orf53, etc are mentioned in the plasmid construction section in the Material and methods. Please provide a brief explanation for the relationship between these genes and Hero proteins. - Please add more details in the Material and methods section, especifically in western blotting and the luciferase assay, to support the reproducibility of these experiments. - Figure 1A. Please explain the role of each component (for example factorXa) either in the text or the legend. - Figure 1B: Please add clarification regarding the normalization of lanes by total protein concentration. - Fig 1C. Please provide an explanation for the higher order bands in the western blot. The western blot using anti-FLAG antibodies shows non-specific bands. Alternative tags or antibodies or detection methods may be used, for example, GFP tag and in-gel fluorescence can be used to check the expression. - Figure 1D and 1E, the error bars are high. Suggest checking the data and providing the  mathematical expressions used to calculate relative yields. - Figure 2D and E, the error bars are high, access to the raw data behind the graphs may aid interpretation. An explanation for the choice of temperatures 33 C and 37 C would be helpful. Is there any relation between the choice of temperature and the Tm of the protein? The protein is directly being treated at high temperature, similar experiments with cell-based assays would be helpful to understand the effect of the Hero proteins on the stability of Fluc. Would it be possible to report the mathematical expressions used to calculate “Remaining Fluc activity”. Recommend indicating n if these activities are calculated per mg of the protein. Please explain if the reduction in activity is due to loss of protein or loss of luminescence activity from each molecule of the protein. - Figure S1, access to the raw data would be helpful to understand the signal to noise ratio for activity. - Figure 2 and 3 show similar experiments with wild type and mutants, it may be possible to combine the figures (for example, to avoid the redundancy in Figure 2C and 3A). - Figure 3D and G, access to the raw data would be helpful to interpret the signal and noise ratio especially given the low values. - Figure 4, Can some further discussion be provided for the reason for higher residual activity for SM and DM than wild type? Tm experiments during stress conditions (heat shock and freeze thaw cycles) may be helpful to define the stability of Fluc and Fluc mutants. - Figure 5: Suggest including an explanation for choosing Proteinase K -among other proteases- for these experiments. - The residual activity is different in Figure 4 and 5, which could be due to different stress conditions. Please include some discussion about possible explanations. - In section “Hero proteins protect Fluc activity better in cis than in trans”, ‘ When the molarity of recombinant GST, Hero9, and Hero11 proteins was increased by 10-fold... ’ does molarity refer to the concentration of protein ? - In the first paragraph of the discussion, “ physical shield that prevents collisions of molecules leading to denaturation ” and “ maintaining the proper folding ” is mentioned. Is it the hypothesis for the mechanism behind the stability provided by Hero proteins? Can further discussion on this be provided, along with a relevant reference. - In the discussion section, it is mentioned that  “ Hero may be reminiscent of polyethylene glycol (PEG) ”. Please provide further explanation for why hero proteins are correlated with PEG in this fragment. - A discussion on why specific Hero proteins may be better for specific target proteins may be helpful. - In the second paragraph, of the Discussion “ Hero protein can behave differently depending on the client protein and condition ” and “ important to test multiple Hero proteins to identify one that best protects the protein of interest ” are mentioned. Suggest adding further discussion of these points, for example around any alternatives or computational predictions or simulations to test individual Hero proteins for specific client proteins.",2022-07-13T13:46:46,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2022.03.03.482928,Fusion with heat-resistant obscure (Hero) proteins have the potential to improve the molecular property of recombinant proteins,"Eri Morimoto, Kotaro Tsuboyama, Yukihide Tomari",2022-06-11

We are glad that you liked our study. The presence of warm-water coral reefs was considered if they were within 10 km radius from the RLS sampling locations, because samplings in some cases were carried out in a very close proximity to a coral reef (i.e. not right on it). The 10 km radius represents a buffer zone to account for the movement patterns of coral reef fishes which can vary a lot, e.g. from 0.1 km (e.g. damselfishes) up to 10 km (e.g. wrasses) or even hundreds of kilometres for larger fishes. Therefore, we decided that having a 10 km buffer zone is a better descriptor of richness in our analysis. The RLS database also covered areas that were further than 10km away from coral reefs. Here we used the word “mediating” from the perspective of causal analysis. For example, MPAs is a mediator variable between the presence of coral reefs and species richness in our analysis, where the effect of coral reefs on richness is transmitted through MPAs (see the full causal graph in the Supplementary Information). Richness in coral reefs is on average higher, but MPAs increase (enhance) this effect even more in coral reefs. However, the mediator variable in causal analysis can both increase or decrease the effect between two other variables.",2022-07-10T19:19:39,andreatabi,Andrea Tabi,10.1101/2022.06.02.494503,Marine protected areas regulate the structure of fish communities threatened by global warming and human impact,"Andrea Tabi, Luis J.

A key attribute of AARSs is that they have specialized to transfer specific amino acids to their cognate tRNAs, with minimal cross-reactivity. Although there are two major classes of AARSs (Class I and II), they focus specifically on Class I AARSs (since they could not perform a stable phylogenetic analysis on Class II). To this end, they have employed structure based sequence alignment of HUP domains of different Class I AARSs, based on which they built phylogenetic trees and performed ancestral sequence reconstruction. They make interesting, but counterintuitive, observations on the evolutionary trajectory of AARSs in comparison to the timeline of emergence of amino acids themselves. Specifically, they note that AARSs which charge amino acids that emerged later in time appear as early branches in the phylogenetic tree and vice versa. They also observe that one of the AARS ancestor (Anc-all-minus) had a wide substrate binding pocket that did not confer amino acid sidechain selectivity, but rather selected for L-configuration ɑ-amino acids. Based on these results, the authors propose a new model of evolution of Class I AARSs called generalist-maintaining (GM), where the early ancestor with non-specific/generalist activity is maintained and as amino acids emerged later in time, became starting point for the evolution of specialized AARSs. Overall, the paper is concise and self-sufficient. The conclusions drawn by the authors are significant and well supported by data. There are a few minor points that we want to bring to the attention of authors, which could improve the manuscript further. Minor points: The authors discuss one set of ancestral reconstruction throughout the paper. Were there any alternatives generated by the software used? If yes, on what basis was this particular reconstruction chosen? Perhaps, if there are alternatives, the authors could build the ancestry based on them and see if it yields similar results. If it does, it could make the conclusions from this paper more robust. The authors mention in a single sentence in Methods - “Ancestral states were inferred using codeml from the PAML package”. Since this is one of the most important steps in this work, some explanation about how this was done and any parameter choices or tuning can be useful. On Page 7, they say “The anticodon binding domains are thought to have emerged later, in agreement with our analysis, which indicated that the anticodon domains of Class I AARSs relate to at least three separate evolutionary emergences (Table S1)”. The three emergences of anticodon domains is not clear from Table S1. If we are to go by the different H groups according to ECOD, there are only two in the anticodon binding domain column in Table S1. Some clarity on this will be helpful Since the authors frequently compare the specialization of AARSs with the emergence of amino acids, a schematic showing the order of appearance of amino acids will be more illustrative than making the readers refer to multiple papers. Potentially using real amino acids in Figure 4 would be more clarifying than A,B,C,D,E? The phylogenetic trees shown in Figure S4 are key to this work. The authors could make the Raxml tree (since this was used for ancestral reconstruction) a main figure to guide the reader about this important part of the paper. The expansions of many abbreviations used throughout the paper haven’t been given (for example - HUP, HIGH, ECOD) The importance of outgroups in ancestral reconstruction is remarked upon twice “due to the lack of a suitable outgroup, making ancestor reconstruction intractable.”... “Using Clade 2 as an outgroup, we succeed in the construction” - but would benefit from a sentence or two (and reference) explaining this necessity to readers from non-phylogenetic backgrounds. The discussion of the structural/functional characteristics of the inferred ancestors could be expanded. For example:  “Further, the inferred Anc-All-minus pocket bears no hallmarks of a Val activating enzyme,” it is unclear which hallmarks you are referring to and what is different in the ancestor. Predicted AlphaFold2 structures of the ancestors might help here, especially aligned with substrate bound/docked structures of extant AARSs.

I am not 100% sure whether your question is with respect to irregular, but known perturbations from the planned sampling and dosing times in the clinic or with respect to unknown perturbations that have not been documented, i.e. uncertainty in the measurement times and dosing times etc. The former is straightforwardly implemented in PAM, as the likelihood/posterior is defined conditional on the measurement times, and dosing times, p(y | psi, sigma, t, r). So, if the perturbations are known, then these conditional statements can be made with respect to those times. However, if the perturbations are unknown, then the inference is slightly harder. Although not discussed in the article one can extend the framework to model this additional source uncertainty and use PAM analogously to quantify the structural uncertainty. In particular, one express the uncertainty of the measurement times by constructing a model for likely measurement times given a recored measurement time, t = t' + epsilon, where t' is the recorded time and epsilon is the residual recording error. This gives rise to a distribution of likely 'true measurement times' p(t | t') which depends on the recorded time and the scale of epsilon. You can now formulate a likelihood that incorporates the uncertainty in the measurement times, p(y | psi, sigma, t', r) = int dt p(y | psi, sigma, t, r) p(t | t'). This can be done for measurement times, dosing times, dose amount and all other quantities that are assumed to be known and are conditioned on. Overall, modelling the uncertainty of the measurement times and dose amounts will lead to more uncertainty in the parameter estimates and to a more uniform distribution of the model weights than if this uncertainty was ignored. Let me know if this answered your question and please don't hesitate to reach out for any clarifications of the above.",2022-07-10T13:59:43,,David Augustin,10.1101/2022.03.19.483454,Treatment response prediction: Is model selection unreliable?,"David Augustin, Ken Wang, Antje-Christine Walz, Ben Lambert, Michael Clerx, Martin Robinson, David Gavaghan",2022-03-21

I think this provides a number of useful references and comparisons. I also have a few comments: 1) While rMATS and MISO are popular programs, I don't think they are necessarily my preferred starting point for splicing analysis. For example, I might consider the following as starting points for splicing analysis: a) QoRTS + JunctionSeq (an extension of DEXSeq with a separate dispersion estimate for junctions versus exons) b) Custom analysis of the tab-delimited splice junction counts ( SJ.out.tab ) from STAR. Perhaps b) is too open-ended.  However, if you labeled the junctions like genes or transcripts, you could calculate Count-Per-Million (CPM) values and perhaps use traditional differential expression methods (DESeq2, edgeR, limma-voom, etc.). Unlike a) , there would not really be specialized splicing visualization for b) without additional coding. However, both of these strategies do not fit the description of ""alternative splicing events (ASEs) are conceptualized as binary choices"".  Instead, each junction is treated like a feature. So, I can see how that can complicate comparisons.  Nevertheless, limma-voom and DESeq2 are used as part of this package.  If I look at the ASE-methods.R code and the supplemental methods, I think the main difference is the "" Treatment:Isoform"" interaction variable. In other words, if you had 2 groups with 3 replicates and 2 junctions as part of splicing event, am I understanding the that the difference between SpliceWiz and what I would have otherwise expected is that you now have 12 count measurements (2 junctions) instead of 6 count measurements (1 junction)? So, if I am understanding everything, I am not sure if you have comments with respect to why a strategy more like JunctionSeq (or what I might write with custom code for individual junctions) is not preferable and not provided as an option within SpliceWiz? 2) I thought Figure S4 was interesting and useful. However,  the retained intron counts are quite different, as also mentioned in the text: "" Of the 15,188 extra retained introns annotated by SpliceWiz, 15,144 (99.7%) of these would have been excluded due to this extra criterion."" Identifying additional differential intron retention events might be helpful, but I also wonder if perhaps this also corresponds to additional false positives.  For example, I am also not sure how often there might be pre-mRNA and/or pseudogenes where no introns are spliced (not a single retained intron event).  For example, if there are confounding factors not sufficiently modeled in simulated data, then I would expect estimates of accuracy could be considerably different than in actual data. 3) As a minor point, there is a typo in the description for Figure 5: ""H eir ar a chical"" instead of ""H ie rarchical"".

For clarity, we also share the reviewer comments and our responses to that with you: Reviewer Comments: Reviewer 1 This is a very elaborate and interesting study proposing a dynamic genetic screen based on FRET-FLIM and which allows for a more refined understanding of the impact of gene knockouts on cellular signaling and metabolic processes compared to the simple cell viability and colony formation readouts widely used in the past (and also currently). The authors used an innovative FRET-FLIM sensor (created by them) expressed in stable cell lines to monitor changes in the levels of cyclic AMP by modulating phosphodiesterase-induced breakdown via treatment with silencing RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides. I only have a few comments regarding the text of the article, as follows. 1.	It is very difficult to understand from the abstract the purpose of the paper, at least from the standpoint of the general FRET enthusiast with no specific knowledge regarding the biological application described. (i) Specifically, in the second paragraph, the agonist of what receptor are the authors referring to? What is the connection between the” 22 different phosphodiesterases (PDEs)” and the baseline levels of cAMP. Is that what the sentence refers to? It is hard to guess from the current sentence structure. (ii) The authors used “HeLa cells stably expressing our FRET-FLIM sensor.” Precisely what sensor does “our” stand for? (iii) The rest of the paragraph does not seem much easier either, especially given the numerous undefined acronyms. All these questions are fully addressed in the body of the paper, though not in the abstract. The last 75% of the abstract has been completely rephrased to address hopefully all of the reviewers concerns. Changed part is indicated with track-changes. 2.	On page 3, the authors state: “FLIM is a robust and inherently quantitative method for FRET detection which requires no additional calibrations or correction parameters.” That is not entirely correct, for a couple of reasons: (i) FLIM generally requires separate knowledge of the donor lifetime in the absence of FRET. The reviewer is right. We condensed the text so much that we cut some corners. We have now rephrased that claim, and mentioned that the donor lifetime is a necessary calibration. See page 3. (ii) One has to fully separate the donor emission from acceptor emission, which is usually done achieved band-pass filters (it is also done, though not very often, using spectral resolution). This is not unlike what is done in intensity-based measurements, in which, at least one is attempting to unmix the donor and acceptor signals or at least apply some post-measurement corrections for bleed through (caused by spectral overlap between donor and acceptor emission). The fact that FLIM researchers often choose to ignore this kind of corrections may not be interpreted, in my view, as an advantage of FLIM. Please consider adjusting the text. We could not agree more!  In particular in view of our own contributions to obtain truly quantitative sensitized emission FRET (van Rheenen et al, BJ 2004), we are keenly aware of the dangers of spectral overlap. That is the reason that in this study we used our Epac-SH189 FRET sensor which has dark (i.e. non-emitting;  Y145W mutation; Klarenbeek et al, PLoSOne 2015 ) acceptors. Given the high QY of the donor, the lifetime of this sensor has ignorable contribution of acceptor emission even if a large spectral window is selected. We did not attempt unmixing approaches, because our pilots had indicated near-identical lifetimes when the emission was taken just from the part of the spectrum that is exclusively occupied by mTurquoise.  This information is presented towards the end of the introduction on page 5, in the paragraph where we present a more specific outlook to the contents. It has been rephrased in part for better emphasis. 3.	The results shown in Figures 6 and 7 are fascinating. To let the reader more easily follow the story, could the authors insert “agonist” or “antagonist” as necessary within the following sentences? “We first stimulated HeLa cells with 40 nM isoproterenol which caused a rapid rise in cAMP levels and subsequently added propranolol at 60 nM concentration which caused a sharp decline following the stimulation. Finally, 25 µM forskolin…” We have adapted the text (page 14) and legend of figure legends (page 15) according to these suggestions. Once again, in my evaluation, this is an excellent, detailed, and rich in information study worthy of publication in a high caliber journal. Reviewer 2 The manuscript submitted by Harkes et al. on the topic of FRET-FLIM HCS with siRNA screen to monitor dynamically the change of cAMP concentration using a FRET biosensor is well written with interesting results and shows the high potential of this method. In order to increase its impact and for clarification I have few queries: [1]  I found the introduction of interest but previous work in the scope of HCS FLIM is missing. I suggest to add references of several groups working in this direction (French, Tramier, Esposito...). In our introduction we sought to emphasize work that is geared towards screening of fast dynamic changes in lifetime in living cells, which implies imaging with very high photon fluxes and with methods that do not waste photons unnecessarily, so as to avoid unnecessary cell damage. We agree with the reviewer that this does not acknowledge much of the work of those who contributed to high-content and high-speed FLIM imaging, in particular from pioneers like Drs French, Tramier, Esposito, but also e.g.  Gerritsen, Ameer-Beg and others. We have now rewritten that part (page 4) and added 4 references to just a few of the very relevant contributions. [2] For lifetime analysis, authors have used biexponential fit with two fixed lifetimes 3.4 and 0.6 ns with a final determination of mean lifetime using the different preexpo factors. I'm not sure that this approach is the more appropriate. First, what means these two fixed lifetimes? is it pertinent with the biosensor under study? this is not really discussed in the manuscript. Second, if finally you use a mean parameter for the concentration curve fitting, why not using a mean analysis such as the mean arrival time? This parameter is now directly calculated in the FALCON version and seems pertinent because HyD have very low noise. From my point of view, this will increase the sensitivity and the speed of the measurement. In any case, this has to be discussed. In fact, we had given this quite a bit of thought but for brevity, it did not make it to the final draft. In brief, we performed 2-component fits because these fitted much better than single-component fits. The lifetimes of 3.4 and 0.6 ns were selected because these were the dominant components in large numbers of global (i.e. whole-image) fits. We expected a dominant component of 3.4 ns, which is that of the Epac sensor in its low-FRET configuration. The low lifetime, 0.6 ns, is in fact significantly below the resting-state lifetime of the cells (minimally 1.9 ns in some cells) but it is the second dominant Tau in the two component fits and the phasor analysis also indicates a intercept below 1 ns. Our data were thus collected and exported (data reduction) for those two components, enabling us to analyze both effects on long as well as on short lifetime contributions upon PDE knockdown. In preparing figures for the manuscript, we noted no clear advantage of separately presenting data of both lifetimes and their amplitudes, so we decided to extract the weighted mean lifetime. This has now been described more completely in the Methods section (page 6).  For the reviewer, we also note that we are not fond of using the FALCONs mean photon arrival time because 1st, unlike the fitting, it proved to be quite sensitive to environmental (background) light, and 2nd, there is a small bug in our version of the software which sometimes causes erroneously high lifetimes when recalculating old data with the ‘mean photon arrival time’ option. 3rd, this method has the same number of free fit parameters as a single component fit. We experienced that the result with this method had less pixel to pixel variation compared to a single component fit. [3] When showing screen results, only fitting parameters are presented in figures. Is it too difficult to present few curves in which differences can be shown? This will increase the understanding of the reader before to present the statistics. We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. Two panels have now been added to the boxplot in  Fig. 4 [4] From my point of view, details regarding how to add drugs in multi-well plate has to be presented. Is it pipeting ? and in this case it does not really make High Content automated approach. Moreover, how is managed the focus since probably you loose it during pipeting... or is it more automated device that you use in the context of multiwell plate. In addition, how is selected the FOV? how to manage the human choice? This has to be detailled and discussed. We have extended the text in Materials and Methods to cover all of these aspects, see page 6, 7. In brief, in this study we present only data from studies where stimulus addition and mixing where done manually, although we have also implemented automated addition of stimuli (3 channels). For the protocol involving rapid sequential agonist-antagonist stimulation we found that, at least with our equipment, automated addition of stimuli depended too much on diffusion, and therefore results were more variable than with manual mixing. For keeping in focus, we routinely used the Leica hardware  focusing option, AFC. One last important issue: in revising our manuscript, we noted that the reported sequences for siRNAs used for PDE8A accidentally had become mixed up. We now corrected those entries in Supplementary Table S1. This correction does not affect any of the experiments, microscopy data or interpretations whatsoever, it solely affects one row in that table. We expect that with those changes, we have adequately addressed all issues raised by the reviewers. We feel that the manuscript has significantly improved in the review process and we are indebted to both reviewers for their time and thoughtful comments.

Our article published earlier this year, in which we reached remarkably similar conclusions. Sin our paper is not quoted in yours, we wish to send you some comments about the similarities and differences. We find rather interes ting that from the use of Non Negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) applied to your experimental data you reached conclusions that are similar to ours, which were obtained with a stochastic approach applied to classic published data from neuromuscular junctions of frog and mammals. In brief, the similarities we find are: 1.	The differences in synaptic strength are not primarily caused by variable probability of fusion but determined by the fraction of matured release machinery of docked synaptic vesicles. 2.	Fusion reflects the resting distribution of mature and immature priming states. 3.	We both estimate the numbers or proportions of vesicles in different pre-fusion states. 4.	The values estimated for the forward resting rate constants for the vesicle priming are virtually the same in both studies. 5.	The forward rate constants in both studies are accelerated by calcium in an activity-dependent manner. 6.	In both papers we reach the conclusion only the forward rate constants are susceptible to change due to calcium. There are also some differences: 1.	You propose an additional parallel step to adjust the responses upon high stimulation frequencies. We do not require such step. 2.	You adjust your model to facilitation at low frequencies and depression at high frequencies. We find a coexistence of facilitation and depression using the same theoretical approach. In addition, our study suggests that: 1.	Spontaneous and asynchronous release can be expressed as spontaneous forward transitions from primed to fusion. 2.	In our study, the backward constants are much larger than the resting forward rate constants 3.	In our case, the recycling of the vesicle pool contributes to depression. although you don´t deal with it in your model, you have done extensive work on the matter. 4.	Your finest way to simulate calcium indicates that the calcium-dependence of the forward rate constant is linear; ours considers a non-linear dependence. In addition to intrinsic differences in the type of synapse studied in each paper, another major difference is the use of differential equations in your study versus the stochastic approach in ours. Yours allowed the numerical solution and a finer calculation of the calcium concentration. The stochastic approach allowed us to predict accurately two additional behaviors, which are absent from your study: spontaneous release and asynchronous release. Altogether, the common findings in our studies suggest that such sequential maturation process of the fusion machinery with certain adaptations may be common to different synapses. Therefore, we wish to invite you to read our paper and to quote it in your article. Needless to say that your recognition tour study will bring its general impact up immediately. In addition both our findings will strengthen each other. I wonder if exchanging each other´s data to be fitted with the different approaches will confirm general mechanisms and give light as to synaptic-specific ones. I would also like to ask you if a joint review would be of interest to you? As a brief introduction to myself, I contacted you some years ago when John Nicholls and I co-organized a pair of Royal Society meetings in 2015 on extrasynaptic release of transmitters, the topic in which I do most of my work. Our common friend Walter Stuhmer was there. Last year I coordinated the sixth edition of From Neuron to Brain, in which Walter reviewed some of the chapters. Sincerely, Francisco F.

Review synthesized by Bianca Melo Trovò. Genetic transcription happens through individual Transcription Factors (TFs) whose binding events can, in some systems, temporally correlate with the stochastic firing of transcriptional bursts. The determinant of bursting is however unclear, specially whether the DNA binding kinetics solely contributes to that. The study develops an imaging-based synthetic recruitment assay called CRISPRburst in order to measure the TFs impact on bursting kinetics. The authors find that the association of TFs with specific protein partners determines their bursting output, and train a model to predict the kinetic signatures of all human TFs. Major comments The manuscript reports that “the maximal intensity per transcription site (TS) is likely limited by physical constraints of the transcription machinery as a limited number of RNA polymerase molecules can be loaded per gene due to polymerase velocity and spacing”. It is recommended to describe how this limitation correlates with the value of active fraction, or could be part of further analysis of this functional data. ‘Functional characterization of TFs using an imaging-based synthetic recruitment assay’ section: “If the frequency and duration of active periods were solely defined by TF binding” [...] “TFs recruited via dCas9 would all exhibit similar active fractions”. This prediction appears to rely on the assumption that the binding rate is the same for all TFs, which is usually not the case. ‘Functional characterization of TFs using an imaging-based synthetic recruitment assay’ section: Given that the TFs that do not bind to the LTR also show high correlation, it is unclear how the correlation for the 6 factors that directly bind LTR justifies that dCas9 recruits TFs in a similar way to the physiological conditions. What is the explanation for the high correlation coefficient for the TFs that do not bind LTR? There is a question as to whether the dCas9 system represents the physiological conditions because the DNA binding kinetics for each TFs are distinct, and different from that for PYL1 binding to ABI1. It would be expected that those different DNA-binding kinetics also contribute to the frequency, duration, or intensity of bursting. Some clarification could be provided around this point. ‘Interactions with co-activators are more predictive of TF kinetic specificity than IDR features’ section “This model was unable to classify TFs into kinetic classes (Figure 3B, right), demonstrating that TF-cofactor interactions play a greater role in specifying kinetic function than IDR sequence content”: Given that TFs interact with cofactors through their transactivation domains, which are intrinsically disordered, why do the TF-cofactor interactions not lead to correlation between IDRs and the kinetic function? Could the protein-protein interactions besides IDR-cofactor (e.g. cofactor-cofactor interactions) play a role in the kinetic function? Do the cofactors cluster into the different kinetic function groups? Minor comments Introduction ‘differ in features typically used to classify TFs, such as DNA binding domain homology’: it may be worth making a mention in the introduction to what other binding partners TFs interact with. First paragraph of results ‘CRISPRburst, an inducible dCas9-mediated recruitment platform to study transcription kinetics’: What is the binding strength of PYL1 to ABI1? How does that compare to the typical TF-DNA binding strength? Figure 1C: “3) Live cells are imaged 16 h post-recruitment.” This is the end time point. Are there time-dependent data available? Figure 1 F,  G: The error bars are high. Can further information be provided in the legend on how these error bars were calculated (biological vs technical replicates)? Figure 1, ‘An average of 220 cells were analyzed per TF’ Does this imply that 220 transcription sites were scored? Considering each imaged cell has single integration of the reporter gene? ‘In total, the LTR-MS2 cell line stably expresses 1) the LTR-MBS reporter gene’: Is there information on where in the genome the reporter gene is integrated? And does it impact the transcription bursts? (considering the role of (epi)genetics in the transcriptional outcome as rightly reinforced by the data related to Fig.4). Functional characterization of TFs using an imaging-based synthetic recruitment assay: Please provide a description for the Krüppel associated box. “Upon recruitment, 28 TFs generate an increase in reporter active fraction”. It would be helpful to provide further clarification on how the reporter active fraction is defined and how the criteria ""ratio > 1.30"" was determined. A mathematical equation may also aid the description. ‘0.64 to 3.04 for active fraction and 0.68 to 1.64 for intensity (Figure 1F-G, S1E) ‘: It may be helpful to divide the active fraction (0.64 to 3.04) into different categories, for example, 3.04 - 2.5, 2.5-2.0 etc. to check whether these categories are correlated to function. Regarding intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in the Results section ‘Bursting kinetics define distinct TF classes’: Can further clarification be provided in the main text for the meaning of cumulatively longer IDRs. “these findings suggest that while the biophysical properties of IDRs may tune the amplitude of TFs’ effects, they likely do not solely encode TF kinetic specialization”: does this include post-translational modifications? If so, are there any relevant examples or illustrations? In the section ‘TF families exhibit broad kinetic diversity’ section, “the family-defining KRAB domain does not bind DNA but recruits cofactors, consistent with the idea that DNA binding domains provide little information on kinetic specialization (Figure S6B)”. It may be relevant to discuss potential solutions to these issues in the Discussion section. Discussion section “Our study centered on the simple HIV promoter thus provides a robust conceptual framework to investigate more complex systems, e.g. how TFs synergize with one another, interact with core promoter motifs, or communicate to promoters from distal enhancers”: all the future directions mentioned here are very relevant and exciting. Could the discussion of these items be expanded e.g., how do developmental cues drive TF kinetics or bursts? Methods section: Are there any anomalies observed in the subcellular localization of the TFs when tagged with PYL1 or under the ABA treatment? Comments on reporting The manuscript reports a partial least-squares multivariate regression model in which a predictive weight to each possible interactor was assigned. Can further description and a related equation be provided for this model?

The paper say that Late Armenia cluster do have a partial continuity with Early Armenia cluster. The estimated proportion is 50%. That's looks good. But the other 50% can't be from Steppe as You state. Because Late Armenia cluster is shifted to Near East. So it's more likely that the extra 50% is from South not from Steppe 2. The other issue I see is the place of modern Kurdish samples on the PCA. Near Lybians.

Review synthesized by Michael Robicheaux. The preprint manuscript by Trendel et al., “Translational Activity Controls Ribophagic Flux and Turnover of Distinct Ribosome Pools”, presents a dataset that examines the lifecycle of human ribosomes, and their constituent subunit proteins, in response to translational inhibition using proteomics and cryo-EM approaches. The study focuses on the fate of 80S monosomes, which are shown to be inactive and to form a dynamic pool separate from active polysomes and nascent ribosomal subunits. General comments - The manuscript is well-written and organized, and the methodology is thorough and detailed. - The effort to validate mass spectrometry quantitative measurements, particularly the peptide sum normalization (PSN), is commendable. The description of total sum normalization and its weaknesses in this methodology is well articulated. This work will be useful for others working on similar problems in quantitative mass spectrometry. - The described pulse-SILAC methods are quite successful at monitoring protein stability in response to different perturbations; however, the statements in favor of ribosome subunit decay through ribophagy/selective autophagy require further support. Since ribosome component decay can be due to a variety of additional pathways (see cited reference #17, An et al., 2020), it may be necessary to soften the conclusions regarding ribophagy. Additional pulse-SILAC experiments in cell lines that lack key autophagy components (e.g., ATG12/FIP200 KO cells) could be considered to directly test the ribophagy model. - There are questions as to whether the cryo-EM processing supports the conclusions stated in the manuscript. Specific comments regarding this are provided below. In addition, additional processing detail in the flowcharts presented within the supplemental data would be helpful to better understand processing choices (e.g., D classes that move forward for additional analysis/classification/refinement). - It would be relevant to discuss how the proteomic half-life measurements compare to those published by Li et al. 2021 (Mol Cell), which use a different method (cyclohexamide chase). - The manuscript reports significant differences in the half-lives of the 40S/60S ribosomal subunits vs 80S/polysome fractions (Fig 1E), and states that these make up separate ribosomal pools without free exchange. However, it should be considered as an alternative that the decay rate of assembled ribosomes could be much less than the unassembled group so that the pool of free components becomes gradually depleted. In this case, exchange could still occur with a decreasing rate as the pool of free ribosome proteins are degraded faster than assembled ones. It would also be relevant to discuss the possibility that nascent 40S and 60S subunits form 80S monosomes in an alternative “life cycle” pathway. Specific comments and suggestions - In paragraph 1 of the Introduction, please specify the context of “serum withdrawal” as the stimulus for idle 80S ribosome accumulation. Is this from cell culture or some other system? - In paragraph 1 of the Introduction, the sentence, “ Degradation of ribosomal complexes, especially under nutrient-poor conditions, is mediated by ribophagy, a selective form of autophagy [14–17] ” could be more nuanced as it does not describe other non-autophagic ribosomal degradation pathways, such as those described in cited reference #17 (An et al., 2020). - In the “ A Highly Robust Normalization Procedure... ” Results section, the manuscript states that the intensive ribosomal purification methods lead to high variability in the mass spectrometry measurements. Based on this, have alternative methodologies been considered for ribosome purification? - In panel E of Figure 1, the color scheme makes the data difficult to differentiate, could also consider separate figures for the large and small subunit datasets. - In the “Protein Half-Lives in Polysome Profiling Fractions...'' Results section, “ On average ribosomal proteins of the small subunit had 3-fold longer half-lives within the 80S fraction compared to the 40S fraction (p=5.2E-8, Wilcoxon ranksum test), whereas large subunit proteins had 4.6-fold longer half-lives within the 60S fraction compared to the 80S fraction (p=1.0E-10). ” Are the “60S” and “80S” fractions mixed up at the end of the sentence? -In the “ The Monosome Fraction Predominantly Contains Inactive 80S Ribosomes... ” Results section, the manuscript reports, based on their cryo-EM data (Fig. 2), that 80S monosomal complexes are idle and distinct from polysomal 80S complexes. This conclusion of a single ribosome state would need supportive evidence. From the initial particle stack (>1 million) that yielded <60k high-resolution particles after classification: were there other low-resolution class averages or heterogeneous particles that may represent actively translating ribosomes? Conclusions about ribosome activity from less than 5% of the total pool of ribosomes could be due to the conformational plasticity of translating ribosomes. In a different paper (Brown et al., eLife. 2018), several structures/states of the ribosome come out of a smaller dataset. Furthermore, a structure of comparable resolution from the polysome fraction appears necessary to support the conclusion that the 80s monosome complex is functionally distinct. The same comparative data is recommended for conclusions drawn from the cryo-EM structural analysis of arsenite treated 80S particles (Fig .S6). - In the “ The Monosome Fraction Predominantly Contains Inactive 80S Ribosomes.. ” Results section, this section introduces ribosomal P-stalk proteins, their plasticity and role in active ribosomes, which are concepts that could be included in the Introduction section of the manuscript. - In Figure 2, it is unclear from the figure legend if the 80s monosome density in panel B is from the low-salt treated preparation in panel A or from a different prep. - In the “ Inhibition of Translation Produces Inactive 80S Ribosomes... ” Results section, recommend revising the text to reframe the conclusion as ""supports our model"". In the “An Increased Pool of Inactive 80S Ribosomes..” Results section, recommend toning down the claims about decay rates which may require control experiments in cells lacking key autophagy proteins, such as ATG12. - In the “ An Increased Pool of Inactive 80S Ribosomes... ” Results section, consider reframing the conclusions from the previous study (Trendel et al. 2019) to indicate that ribophagy is the predominant mechanism of ribosomal protein turnover in response to arsenite treatment. The prior study did not examine ribosomes treated with arsenite when autophagy was blocked. Additional quantitative tests for flux into lysosomes (Lyso-IP, Ribo-Keima shift assay) should be considered to support that ribophagic flux, specifically, eliminates proteins from ribosomal pools. Based on this comment, the inclusion of ribophagy in Fig. 5 and the statements in the final paragraph of the Discussion may require revision. - In the “ An Increased Pool of Inactive 80S Ribosomes...” Results section, the manuscript describes proteomic data in response to increasing concentrations of arsenite. The effects of these treatments on polysome profiles could be useful future experiments. - In the “ Constrained Conformational Plasticity... ” Results section, there are questions about this analysis due to the small size of the final particle stack for both proteins. An alternative analysis pipeline is to mix the particles from both datasets for the simultaneous analysis of all pooled particles, from which the number of particles in a given state can be quantified. - In the “ Distinct Pools of Ribosomal Subunits... ” Discussion section, the discussion of inactive 80S complexes potentially re-entering the polysome “assembly line” is quite interesting to consider in terms of its dynamics and follow-up experiments that would test this theory (including subcellular localization). In the “ Distinct Pools of Ribosomal Subunits... ” Discussion section, the manuscript posits that the degradation of newly synthesized ribosomal subunits is not energetically favorable; however, it should be considered that intrinsically disordered proteins, such as transcription factors, can be produced and quickly degraded in oscillatory patterns (e.g.  see https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.... A quality control pathway that would eliminate immature or nascent ribosomal subunits is conceivable. - Consider depositing all EM data in EMPIAR and relevant structures in EMDB/PDB, and depositing the mass spectrometry raw data in ProteomeXchange or similar database. A data availability statement could be added with relevant accession links and IDs. - It would be helpful to build a tool to browse protein-level half lives and re-analyze raw data (e.g., tidy script depositing in Github or similar).",2022-07-01T10:23:35,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2022.05.13.491786,Translational Activity Controls Ribophagic Flux and Turnover of Distinct Ribosome Pools,"Jakob Trendel, Milan Aleksić, Matilde Bertolini, Marco Jochem, Günter Kramer, Stefan Pfeffer, Bernd Bukau, Jeroen Krijgsveld",2022-05-13

I have two small questions. - You used the Reef Life Survey Database, and for each sampling location, one of the parameters was whether that location is within 10km of a reef?  I'm not yet familiar with the database, but it sounds like it covers more than reefs and reef-adjacent areas?  (assuming anything further than 10km wouldn't count as reef-adjacent) -  I'm not super-sure the phrasing of ""hypothesize that MPAs counterbalance (mediate) the effect of coral reefs, human density, and thermal stress on species richness"" is fully clear.  In the diagram, I see that a coral reef increases species richness by 54% if the reef is within an MPA, and by only 15% if the reef is not in an MPA.  So, to me, this would not be MPAs ""mediating"" the effects of the reefs.  Maybe enhancing or supporting?  Mediating usually has the connotation of making a negative effect less negative or a positive effect less positive, no? Thanks for the paper.

At the moment, I have one question: Is there a reason why there is not a plot for Asian ancestry in Figure 3? I see mention of ""East Asian"" populations in the ADMIXTURE analysis section of the methods, and I also see a plot similar to what I might expect in Supplementary Figure 11.  It looks like the East Asian contribution is usually small, but the African contribution in Figure 3 is also often small. I mention this because there was a paper reporting mixed Native American ancestry for the MDA-MB-468 cell line (from Hooker et al. 2019), but this was not reproduced in the Cellosaurus ancestry estimates (from Dutil et al. 2019).  It was prepared for a slightly different reason, but I have some additional notes here.  Basically, I think difference may be due to Hooker et al. 2019 using 2 Chinese populations (CHB and CDX) as a proxy for Native American ancestry. So, if others might make a similar assumption, then I thought being able to visualize separate East Asian and Native American estimations might be helpful.  I don't know how common that might happen, but I was aware of at least one example. Thank you very much!
