During the process of reading, I thought in a couple of comments that might be interesting to discuss: 1-In the human samples included, it is not specified the approximate cervical level for each one of them. Since I see that many of them show patent central canals, I was wondering if they might belong to the upper C1, or, maybe, to low medulla, in which canal patency is normal (Garcia-Ovejero et al., BRAIN, 2015, supp fig S3). It is very common to receive samples from tissue banks labelled as cervical cord that anatomically really belong to  low medulla. Maybe a low mag images from your samples could help to identify this, or you could specify the cervical level   of each sample in the table. 2-Some years ago (Garcia-Ovejero et al., JCN, 2013), we found a rare subpopulation of cells in the ependymal region of the rat spinal cord that was unfrequent and mostly located the lateral aspects of the ependymal lining.These cells proliferated during postnatal development and in response to injury, and formed clusters in mature ages. They could be identified by a strong expression of cannabinoid receptor 1 (cnr1, CB1). We also found them in mice. I was wondering if they could be related with the lateral populations of stem cells that you describe here or overlap somehow. Did you find expression of cnr1 in these cells?. Thank you very much for your attention and congratulations again.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.18.476803v2#comment-5832729774,biorxivstage,1,"The following is a review compiled by graduate students participating in the Infectious Disease Journal Club, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University at Albany, SUNY: This paper addresses the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection causes inflammation. The authors argue that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor results in a reduction in CFTR protein levels, which in turn leads to increased inflammation in the COVID-19 airway. This is impactful because the authors identify a mechanism of inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection that was not previously appreciated. Moreover, these findings link the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and cystic fibrosis. The paper is well written and easy to follow; the list of goals at the end of the Introduction, and the italicized conclusions at the end of each results section were particularly helpful and contributed to overall clarity. Overall, the data support the major conclusion that there is less cell-surface CFTR following Spike protein binding, leading to inflammation. Nonetheless, we felt that the title of the paper is overstated, and western blot experiments should be replicated, and quantified where appropriate. Major comments: The paper title is overstated. Specifically, the paper does not look directly in the “COVID-19 airway”, and the paper does not determine the extent to which CFTR-mediated inflammation contributes to inflammation during infection by SARS-CoV-2. We recommend rewording the title to something like “Inhibition of CFTR signaling by the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein leads to inflammation”. Experiments involving western blots should be repeated. Where the differences in protein levels are modest, e.g. TRADD levels in Figure 1, the authors should quantify the band intensity normalized to the control. The authors could either include replicate blots as supplementary data, or quantify all western blot data from replicates, showing variability. Additional comments: It would be helpful if the authors could briefly describe the differences between the original Spike protein and the Beta variant in relation to why the Beta variant binds ACE2 more strongly. Figure 5 could be moved to the supplement since it reanalyzes data shown in other figures. The conclusion from Figure 6 is understated: “Thus the possibility of ACE2 being a physical bridge, direct or indirect, between Spike protein and CFTR cannot be excluded.” The data in Figure 6 make a more compelling case for an ACE2-CFTR interaction than the text suggests. The description of data for ENaC in Figure 8 should be expanded. First, it is not clear from panel A that ENaC gamma cleavage is higher in the presence of Spike protein, rather than overall higher ENaC protein levels with the same degree of cleavage. Second, there is no explanation for the lower band seen in panel B (first lane after the ladder). What is the significance of the pairs of lanes in Figure 6B? Are these replicates? Different elutions? What is the “lysate” lane shown in Figure 6B? Please also explain in the figure legend what “NRS” is. Figure 3 – what concentrations of Spike protein are used in glycoside-treated samples? The legend appears to have an error. The conclusion from Figure 7 is overstated. It does appear that the levels of CFTR at the cell surface are reduced more than total CFTR levels as a result of adding Spike protein, but the mechanism for this cannot be inferred from these data. Suggested future experiments: Test the Beta-1.315 Spike protein variant alongside the original S1S2 Spike protein for experiments shown in Figures 1, 3, and 7.

This practice evokes a very specific set of neurological, physiological and psychological outcomes, which allows for the exceptional experience of freediving to depths as great as 214 meters.  The fact that the breathe-up often involves mouth breathing with a snorkel adds support to the idea that an intrinsic resonance mechanism involving breathing-induced intracranial pressure (ICP) pulses transduced by PIEZO channels may promote promote the specific brain state.  Once the dive commences, cardiac-induced ICP pulses transduced by PIEZO channels may further regulate in a top-down manner the reduction in freedivers' heartbeat rate (to as low as 12 beats/min).",2022-04-19T15:46:36,owen_hamill,Owen Hamill,10.1101/2020.03.24.006452,"Piezo2, a pressure sensitive channel is expressed in select neurons of the mouse brain: a putative mechanism for synchronizing neural networks by transducing intracranial pressure pulses","Jigong Wang, Owen P.

This is the point that, if you drew an outline of the bird as if the white would be negative space, you would have half a bird (a nonexisting entity, especially when compared to the previous frame which is probably the same bird). If you draw the bird as if the white is a white IB saddle, you have an IB. And the outline of the bird is slightly visible around the white. This would address that critique. It should be noted that, in the fog footage, there are frames that can be PIWO. This can mean that there might be different birds present, or that there are angles that an IB can look much like a PIWO (probable). Since you showed the special foot adaptation, I believe you have IB images in this.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.16.484584v1#comment-5826631986,biorxivstage,1,"Naive T cell migration between and within lymphoid organs is essential for detecting cognate antigen on antigen presenting cells; this migration is largely driven by CCL21-CCR7 signaling. This manuscript explores the WNK1 pathway, which is induced by CCR7 signaling and results in ion influx necessary for T cell migration (as shown by this group’s previous work). The authors analyze each WNK1 pathway member’s contribution to migration speed and cell volume through selective ablation and inhibition of proteins within the pathway. They further uncover a spatial enrichment of these proteins at the leading edge of migrating T-cells; localized water entry at this leading edge results in localized swelling and increasing membrane-F-actin spacing. They propose that WNK1 signaling facilitates F-actin polymerization via a Brownian ratchet mechanism. The major success of this paper is in developing a concise model for the role of WNK1 pathway activation and subsequent ion influx in cell migration through localized water entry facilitating F-actin polymerization. Moreover, the authors decisively link chemokine signaling not only to directional decision-making but also to the physical act of cell migration. Only minor aspects of the model require clarification; specifically, it is unclear to what extent WNK1 signaling drives directional migration in addition to physical migration (see below). Simple experiments (or reanalysis of existing ones) might be sufficient either to clarify the model or to demonstrate that the uncertainties in question will require extensive further investigation. Overall, this paper deepens the field’s molecular understanding of chemokine signaling, specifically the extent to which intracellular structural reorganization is a necessary component of chemokine-induced migration. Major Points: -While the data show a WNK1-dependent migration speed effect, they also suggest that this may not be the only effect of WNK1 on cell migration. If WNK inhibitors reduce T-cell shape polarization and increase circularity (supplemental Fig. 1D), is it possible that WNK regulates directional movement in addition to migration speed? Alternatively, given that migration speed is determined from timelapse images multiple seconds apart, is it possible that the measured difference in speed is actually detecting an impaired ability to maintain directional movement? An analysis of displacement vs. distance over the imaging timecourse would provide insight as to whether WNK-inhibited T-cells also display directional dysfunction. Alternatively, providing CCL21 as gradient rather than as a homogenous stimulus could enable an analysis of whether WNK signaling is necessary for accurate directional movement. -The claim that “WNK1 pathway proteins and their activities accumulate at the leading edge of the cell” raises a few unresolved questions. Specifically, does a pre-designated leading edge accumulate WNK1/OSXR1/other WNK signaling effectors? Or do local accumulations of these proteins determine the leading edge of the cell? While a textual revision of this claim could reduce the imprecision, the question raised is interesting and worth answering. For example, when migrating cells switch direction (either spontaneously or in response to an experimentally altered chemokine gradient), do WNK1 and effector proteins begin to accumulate on the new leading edge prior to directional switch, or afterwards? If the former is the case, implying that WNK1 accumulation and signaling may drive selection of a leading edge, WNK1 may play a fundamental role not only in chemokine-driven physical migration but also in the response to chemokine gradients. If the latter is the case, implying that a leading edge recruits WNK1, this signaling pathway would instead drive migration in whatever direction has already been selected. Either way, additional analysis or context would clarify the role of WNK1 signaling in the overall response to chemokine signaling and the extent to which WNK1 drives “movement” vs. “directional migration.” Minor Points: -To the reader unfamiliar with in vitro migration assays, the rationale for the inclusion of ICAM - a signaling molecule that could interfere with analysis of chemokine signaling pathways - is unclear; consider providing a textual explanation for this decision. -As stated, OXSR1 and STK39 both phosphorylate SLC12A2; is their role redundant, are both necessary? (Specifically, if the experiments in Fig 1B are repeated with OXSR1-/-/STK39+/+ and OXSR1+/+/STK39T243A/T234A, would we expect to see the same decrease in migration speed as OXSR1-/-/STK39T243A/T234A, no loss in migration speed, or an intermediate phenotype?) -If AQP3 is the main water channel expressed on CD4 T cells, why does inhibition of this channel not change basal volume of T-cells (as with Wnk1/Osxr1 inhibition)? Does this data suggest a functional redundancy of water channels, as is suggested with ion channels? -Consider providing an explanation or reference for the selection of CDC42/CD44 as definitive markers of the leading and trailing edge. -In Figures 2A-C, it appears that WNK1 and downstream effectors are somewhat enriched at the trailing edge of cells relative to the middle (though to a lesser extent than at the leading edge); speculation as to the significance and cause of this enrichment would help clarify the data. Additionally, the cell expressing GFP alone appears to have a shorter distance from leading to trailing edge, which may also contribute to this effect. -In Figure 3, plasma membrane (PM) and actin signals generated via instant structured illumination microscopy are normalized, and distances between peaks are measured. These peaks are further away at the cell’s leading edge than on the sides, leading to the interpretation that there is more distance between actin and membrane at the leading edge. However, this interpretation ignores the possibility of a thicker and/or differently distributed actin layer at the leading edge, with the densest region (corresponding to the “peak” of the normalized signal) further away from the membrane simply because the layer of actin is thicker. This scenario would produce identical normalized data despite involving no difference in the distance between the edge of the actin layer and the edge of the membrane. While figure 4 suggests that there is less membrane-proximal actin at the leading edge, the actual distance between membrane and the actin that is present remains unclear. Consider providing un-normalized data to help clarify this interpretation (with similar peak intensities between leading and non-leading edges implying similar actin layer distributions). Alternatively, consider comparing the strength of the (non-normalized) actin signal at the location of the membrane signal across cell membrane locations. -In Figure 3B, the actin and membrane signals appear to be normalized to peak actin and peak membrane fluorescence, respectively. In contrast, in Figure 3C, both signals appear to be normalized to peak membrane fluorescence. Consider clarifying whether this is the case, and why these distinct strategies are utilized. -Could the negative effect of hypotonic solutions on the migration speed of phenotypically normal T-cells arise from water entry through non-AQP3 water channels? (Presumably any additional entry of water through AQP3, concentrated at the leading edge, would further increase migration speed). If this is the case, wouldn’t non-specific cell-wide water entry, and subsequent diminishing of directional migration, still occur in WNK-inhibited T-cells? The use of superresolution imaging and/or membrane-proximal actin visualization in experiments involving altered tonicity could provide insight as to where hypotonicity-induced water entry is occurring. Additionally, speculation as to why the benefit of bypassing a blocked WNK pathway overcomes the deficit caused by non-leading-edge-specific water entry (if visualized) would be helpful. -Could labeled materials (e.g. water and sodium isotopes) or depletion of individual ions (i.e. sodium, potassium, etc., one at a time) be used to further characterize the influx of ions and water proposed in this manuscript? While possibly outside of the scope of this paper, consider discussing this (or other biochemical methods) as part of a set of proposed future experiments. Stylistic notes: -The order of the data as presented in the figures does not match the order of data as presented in the text. For example, the first half of figure 1 is discussed, followed by the entirety of figure 2, followed by the second half of figure 1. Consider revising the text to reflect the order of the data in the figures, or vice versa. -Consider including figure 4k as a graphical abstract for the published paper (for people unfamiliar with the signaling pathway and who get confused by the acronyms). Further, on figure 4k, consider adding a visual depiction of G-actin monomer addition to the F-actin filament tips following the depiction of the membrane swelling. -Consider stating the full names of proteins discussed before using their respective acronyms (e.g. lysine deficient protein kinase 1 for WNK1), to help readers unfamiliar with these proteins. Note: We cannot offer expert feedback on the superresolution microscopy methods used, other than the already raised questions about the interpretation of the resulting data.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.24.485684v1#comment-5825327522,biorxivstage,4,"This paper investigates the general phenomenon of bias in journal publication of terms of which experimental methods are used. This includes looking at whether extra experiments using animal models are being requested by reviewers of journal articles. The authors take anecdotal reports of an increased reliance on animal-model validation of experimental results in peer review and measure the prevalence of the phenomenon using a survey. One caveat is that the survey is shared through social media and private channels, introducing a bias in audience receiving it, and also that those most likely to respond will be those personally motivated to do so. In addition, the sample size is somewhat small. However, the authors account for this in their analysis and as the purpose of the study is to start to assess whether the phenomenon exists, this is not a major concern. It would be interesting to see whether there are overlaps in the specific groups identified from the survey results, but I appreciate the sample sizes are small and any results would be purely indicative of further areas for exploration at this stage. For example, are there any trends looking at peer review experience vs number of requests for animal model experiments (is it roughly linear, suggesting it has been occurring at a steady rate over people’s careers and could be static, or are people who are perhaps earlier in their career seeing a higher rate, indicating a possible increase)?  Are the reviewers in the sample who request animal models giving different responses/comments to those who do not request them (there seems to be a 50/50 split)? I was a little confused by the differing frequencies in Figure 2 and Figure 3 (and there may be a figure legend missing for Figure 3, or both charts are in Figure 2 in which case that figure legend needs expanding) - more people responded that they never request animal experiments vs those who say they request 0 or N/A in the frequency chart. Is there a reason for this? One aspect that struck me as most interesting was the request for validation in animal models for work carried out in human systems is very similar to an anecdotal phenomenon from my own experience as a developmental biologist working with Xenopus, and from anecdotal discussions from colleagues, that there is a high request for validation of frog work in tissue-culture systems, or mouse systems. I have heard similar criticisms as those indicated in the boxes. There is also a less similar anecdotal phenomenon in mass spectrometry of requiring Western Blot validation of results, which is a far less sensitive technique. Based on this, could the authors comment on whether the phenomenon they describe could be evidence of larger phenomena, for example, the need to validate across multiple models, or even simply the perception that peer reviewers should just be requesting more experiments? Could there be a phenomenon that is mouse-centric, noting the prevalence of comments about mice? Or is this truly a phenomenon that may be limited to their field? You mention in the discussion that this appears to be a new type of bias, and so I’m curious as to whether that is the case given other “added experiment in other models” phenomena that may exist, but maybe have not been systematically studied and reported. This also would be interesting to compare with the discussion on conservatism bias, because there may be some different questions as to whether the bias is based on innovation, or based on more-rarely-used models, or is based on a drive to add experiments/replicate experiments in multiple systems, all of which have slightly different nuances. The prevalence of mouse models in science and whether there is a bias towards mice would be a question to ask that aligns with the point about the bias of having more enthusiasm for applications addressing someone’s own area of research that the authors mention. The discussion is extremely comprehensive and the article raises a number of very important points for further consideration by the community, and adds new interesting thoughts to the process of peer review from a particular perspective, and is very interesting to read. The results should be taken as quite preliminary and indicative but are a great insight into an interesting topic that has largely been focused on anecdotal complaints. It does not appear that survey respondent names or identifying information were collected, nor information on the journals in question gathered. What could have been useful is being able to determine whether certain journals have a prevalence for this behavior, as particular targets of further work. However, on the basis of this work, one thing that could potentially be very interesting is partnering with journals that people are likely to publish with, presenting them with this information and asking them to distribute a follow-up survey to their reviewers and people who have submitted manuscripts in the past. This would hopefully be very useful for the journals, and perhaps anonymous data could be passed across in a data collection agreement from a number of journals to investigate the phenomenon, without necessarily naming the specific journals in the results. This is purely as an idea to potentially partner with journals who are interested in reform, if one desired outcome of this work is to address this problem explicitly.

However, we remain of the opinion that the backmutated crystal structure should also be included in Figs 2e (ligand) and 2g (TM7-ECL3) in the main text. This is because the authors aim to compare the cryo-EM approach with crystallography, and the backmutant structure features better electron density for the ligand and a better model for the TM7-ECL3 region than the non-backmutant structure shown in the current manuscript, including residue W339/334 in ECL3, which is discussed by the authors, and F/Y7.28. Furthermore, by showing the backmutant in these main Figs, one would better assess the differences in the TM7-ECL3 region between rat and human NTSR1 than in the current Fig 2g, including F/Y7.28 and W339/334, which are crucial for ligand design. In addition, one would immediately realize that the electron density supported well the placement of the chlorine moiety of the ligand, which is not apparent from the current Fig 2e. Additional suggestions: 1) In line 159, it appears that ref 19 has been misplaced, as the back-mutated construct rNTSR1-H4bmx mentioned in that sentence is described in ref 17 (together with all the crystal structures) and not in ref 19.

(Aside: Can someone explain to me what Qeios is, and how it's related to open access?) This paper tests the hypothesis that the olfactory bulbectomy (OBx) model of major depressive disorder (MDD) is caused by a lack of OB gamma band oscillatory input to the limbic system. OBx is a catastrophic surgery accompanied by significant blood loss and requires weeks of recovery. This leads to a confound with neurodegeneration. The current paper used DREADDs to silence the OBs bilaterally and chronically for several weeks. Additionally, they used short term silencing and cancellation / enhancement of gamma oscillations in an LPS model of MDD. Several findings support the hypothesis that it’s loss of OB input to the limbic system that causes the depressive phenotype. There are some differences dependent on the type of silencing. The open field test (OFT) is the gold standard for OBx depression, with hyperactivity and avoidance of the center the classic behaviors indicative of MDD. With chemogenetic silencing, animals avoid the center but are not hyperactive, and they do not exhibit anhedonia. Short term silencing does the opposite - anhedonia but not OFT hyperactivity/center avoidance. These opposite results are interesting and may help get at different mechanisms for anhedonia and anxiety in the OBx model. The authors use closed-loop stimulation locked to the gamma bursts in the OB to determine whether gamma burst activity in the PC reduces depressive symptoms. In the LPS model of MDD, they stimulated to either enhance or cancel out gamma transmission to PC from OB. Enhancing gamma reduced depressive symptoms in LPS, and blocking gamma by stimulating in antiphase with the OB gamma did not reduce symptoms. The authors conclude that loss of gamma is the cause of OBx depression. I am not sure I agree 100% with their conclusions, even though I have no substantive criticisms with the methods and results. Amplifying gamma is sufficient to reduce symptoms, but does canceling it out tell us that it is gamma per se that causes the antidepressant effect? Canceling out gamma does stimulate the fibers going in to the PC but what does the antiphase stimulation do exactly to the PC? Are the same number of action potentials produced, or is the antiphase stimulation doing something fundamentally different to the PC inputs? For the rest of my comments, I need to tell a story, one which I shared with Gyuri the other day. I reminded him of our conversation years ago, when I discussed the idea that OBx depression is due to loss of OB input to the PC and the rest of the limbic system. I envisioned a similar experiment to this one. A few years later we met again at Walter Freeman’s Festschrift in Tucson, the day after Walter had passed away. We discussed the idea again and I told him we were working on it. We never got anywhere with what we tried and Gyuri rightly went ahead. No hard feelings at all, and I am really glad that you all did such a great job on this. I think there is a crucial piece missing though, on the provenance of this idea, and it comes from Walter. I shared with Gyuri way back when we first spoke about this idea one of Walter’s little-known papers, a 1968 J Neurophys article “﻿Effects of surgical isolation and tetanization on prepyriform cortex in cats.” This paper was published the same year as the Becker and Freeman paper cited in this report. While the Becker and Freeman paper shows that PC activity changes when the olfactory bulb is removed, the single authored 1968 paper gets at its cause. The origin of the idea comes from Walter Freeman, as most good ideas in olfaction do. In the 1968 paper, he bulbectomized cats and showed that a normal shock stimulus to the remaining LOT no longer induced the normal oscillatory evoked potential in the PC – there was a single peak in voltage dying off after one cycle. Two hypotheses were considered, 1) the OB drives the oscillation in the PC, when the LOT is stimulated it produces an oscillatory evoked response in the OB, which drives the same response in the PC, and 2) the OB input is necessary for the PC to produce an oscillation. The second hypothesis was the one favored by his results. He replaced the missing OB with tetanic 200Hz low level stimulation of the stump of the LOT and then stimulated with the normal larger shock stimulus during a pause in the tetanic stimulation. Et voila, the oscillatory evoked potential was reinstated in the PC. This relatively obscure paper showed an important role for the OB – it provides abundant excitatory drive to the rest of the system, keeping everything in the right dynamic range. These results were replicated for the entorhinal cortex by Kurt Ahrens (Ahrens and Freeman, Brain Research 2001). The rescue of depressive behavior with gamma enhancement in the LPS model in the current study is intriguing, and the cancellation effect of the antiphase stimulation is compelling. Would the same type of stimulation rescue a silenced olfactory bulb? If it does not, does this mean that different mechanisms are at play for different models of depression? The methods used here may be able to make sense of the mechanisms and usefulness of different models of depression for different types of treatment studies. Already the difference in behavioral effects among the several methods post some very interesting questions.

The paper you sent is quite well-written, yet I find it puzzling in several areas. I hope you will find these comments helpful as you prepare it further for full publication, and in your next work. 1) References in the Introduction. I was surprised to see no mention of the work of: a) Turner, Oros-Peusquens et al (2008), who were able to reliably image the stria of Gennari in several volunteers, with nearly isotropic voxels (0.4x0.4x0.5) mm3 at 3T, using an IR-TSE sequence. While you mentioned the slightly earlier work of Barbier, it is obvious that isotropic voxels with 0.5 mm resolution or smaller are essential for characterization of microstructure, and it was the Turner paper that pioneered this breakthrough. b) Trampel, Ott and Turner (2011), who actually used ultra-high resolution (0.5 mm isotropic) 7T structural MRI to address an important neuroscientific and clinical question--the extent to which congenital blindness alters the structure of the visual cortex. This paper, on its own, contradicts the current paper's statement:""However, in vivo mesoscopic MRI has not advanced beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and has not been incorporated into the toolkit of practicing neuroscientists."" Indeed there are other recent papers which use structural 7T MRI at high resolution to discover new knowledge about brain organization. c) Bazin, Dinse et al (2014) and Waehnert, Dinse et al (2016) which present a complete suite of image processing tools that can ""optimally process mesoscopic imaging data."" These tools, largely created by Pierre-Louis Bazin and including equivolume cortical layering, have already been used widely in some groundbreaking studies, for example Gau et al, Elife 2020. If your group found good reason not to use these tools, for instance preferring to segment your images manually, it would help the community to explain why. It might therefore be a good idea--more courteous and accurate--to tone down some of the claims of novelty made in this Introduction section. 2) Remarks about layer structure in primary visual cortex. You comment (end of Section 3) that ""It can be seen that there are lower T2* values around the middle of the cortical thickness. This structure is likely the stria of Gennari..."". Of course it is the Stria of Gennari. Many researchers have now compared myelin-stained cadaver brain sections with ex vivo and in vivo MRI scans of primary visual cortex. The increased myelin density and higher iron content in the Stria of Gennari significantly reduce T1 and T2*, and this is unquestionably the source of the line in an MRI scan with sufficient spatial resolution, whether qT1, qT2*, phase imaging or simply T1w. No further explanation is needed! The Stueber et al paper of 2014 (not cited here) is quite conclusive. A further comment. The Stria of Gennari in your T1 maps (Figure 6 of your paper) shows up quite poorly. Indeed, there is hardly a decrease in T1 to be seen in the middle of the cortex, especially in the average along the cortical plane. It has become a familiar observation from published papers (such as Duyn et al) that the Stria shows up more clearly and sharply in T2*-weighted images than it does in MP2RAGE T1 maps with the same nominal spatial resolution. It was clear to me several years ago that this effect was probably  due to the MRI sequence, rather than any anatomical subtlety. Iron-stained sections of primary visual cortex show a thickness of the Stria very similar to that seen in myelin stained sections, with a similar increased myelin and iron density towards the white matter. The image sharpness issue seems to be the point spread function of the MP2RAGE sequence. Because each of the long train of echoes is actually recorded at a different inversion time, the point spread is convolved with the recovery curve of the longitudinal magnetization, and is thus broadened. It was to circumvent this problem that I devised the Multi-Shot Multi-Slice Inversion Recovery EPI sequence, now implemented brilliantly by Rosa Sanchez-Panchuelo and colleagues at Nottingham. Here each of the EPI acquisition windows is short in duration compared with T1, and the broadening is much reduced. You can see this in Figure 8 of our 2021 paper (attached), where our MS-IR-EPI T1 maps show a much sharper Stria. Fabrizio Fasano and I demonstrated this at last year's ISMRM using a gel phantom with a sharp boundary between two gels with different T1s. I would recommend this sequence to anyone interested in quantitative mapping of cortical myelin at high resolution. 3) In Section 3.4.2 your paper states: ""T1 contrast is also known to be related to myelination and therefore used for delineating areal borders (Cohen-Adad et al., 2012; Deistung et al., 2013; Dick et al., 2012; Haast et al., 2016; Marques et al., 2017). While there have been efforts to acquire mesoscopic resolution T1 and T1-weighted images in the past (Federau & Gallichan, 2016; Lüsebrink et al., 2021; Lüsebrink et al., 2017), there has not yet been a quantitative T1 dataset together with T2* at mesoscopic resolution in the living human brain."" Yes, indeed, T1 contrast is related to myelination. There are several papers (e.g. Leuze 2017, Morawski 2018) showing that if CLARITY is used to clear the myelin from cadaver brain, T1 contrast completely disappears. Could you put this first line a little more strongly, perhaps? The first paper to argue that quantitative T1 maps should be the most accurate in vivo guide for cortical parcellation was actually Geyer et al (2011, attached), describing results shown at the OHBM meeting in 2010, which then in fact inspired David van Essen and Matt Glasser to attempt their own parcellation of the cortex, partly based on the arbitrary ratio of the image intensities of T1-weighted MP-RAGE images and TSE images (also mostly inversely T1 weighted, but inaccurately denoted 'T2-weighted' images). In the attached Geyer paper you can find a reasonably complete summary of previous related work. 4) At the beginning of Section 4.2 you state: ""However, as argued within (Wallace et al.,2016), mesoscopic in vivo imaging may still be insufficient to capture the subtle changes in myeloarchitecture aside from primary visual cortex where the stria of Gennari is extremely thick."" Perhaps you have missed the papers by Skeide (2018) showing hypermyelination of left auditory cortex in dyslexic individuals, and Kuehn (2017) showing subtle variations in myelination of BA3b relating to somatosensory fields. 5) One last comment--have you tried denoising your images? With luck, you might gain a factor of 3 in SNR, and they would look more convincing.",2022-04-07T20:30:32,disqus_QxHwE8A5az,Robert Turner,10.1101/2021.11.25.470023,Mesoscopic Quantification of Cortical Architecture in the Living Human Brain,"Omer Faruk Gulban, Saskia Bollmann, Renzo Huber, Konrad Wagstyl, Rainer Goebel, Benedikt A.

None of these mechanisms cares about the chemical bonds between the atoms, so there can be no meaningful difference between 1 g/cm2 of melanin and 1 g/cm2 of pretty much any other organic compound.  (This is not necessarily the case for charged particle radiation, like the deuterons in reference [33]).  The chemical formula of melanin is  C18 H10 N2 O4, which has no high-Z elements in it that could enhance x- and gamma-ray attenuation, as noted (with no reply) by VGR Subramanian.  I'm elaborating here for future readers.  In the current version of the article the authors back off slightly from their claims, but they still ignore the basic physical mechanisms that imply that organic material is organic material as far as x- and gamma- radiation shielding is concerned.  Whether it is living material, melanin, etc. cannot make it perform better than any other random slab of CHNO compounds.   To suggest otherwise would require a standard of proof high enough to justify overturning 125 years of settled physics on the interaction of radiation with matter. -David Smith University of California, Santa Cruz",2022-04-06T07:33:18,disqus_PxoJFL5yQ7,David Smith,10.1101/2020.07.16.205534,A Self-Replicating Radiation-Shield for Human Deep-Space Exploration: Radiotrophic Fungi can Attenuate Ionizing Radiation aboard the International Space Station,"Graham K.

One of your arguments in the Intro is how well MEG can register signals from 'deep structures, compared to superficial cortical structures'.

The Chlamydomonas mutant lacking LHCBM1 ( npq5) displays a low NPQ phenotype. The authors found that the antenna size and LHCSR3 accumulation are not responsible for the lower NPQ phenotype in npq5. They also artificially acidified the lumenal pH to protonate LHCSR3 for NPQ induction and found that npq5 NPQ is still low. They propose that absence of LHCBM1 could alter the association of LHCSR3 with the PSII supercomplex or that LHCBM1 interacts with LHCSR3 which would enhance its quenching capacity. This work enriches the knowledge about the impact of lack of LHCBM1 on antenna size, PSII function, LHCSR1 and 3 proteins accumulation and NPQ capacity during a 48-h high light treatment. Major comments - Fig. 1, it is stated that LHCBM1 (Type IV) does not accumulate but Fig. S1 and S2 show that Type IV accumulates between 7 and 9% of the total amount of LHCBMs. Could you comment on this accumulation, and whether it increases in high light? - Statistical test between WT and npq5 for all the data represented in bar graphs would be required to state that differences are significant. Consider showing all data points in addition to error bars. - Consider providing Fo and Fm values for all fluorescence measurements (and D1 accumulation) to discuss whether a possible increased Fo in npq5 in HL is due to disconnected antenna and/or loss of functional core complexes. - Discussion, discuss why there is much less LHCSR1 in the npq5 mutant? Is this regulation at the transcriptional or post-translational level? It could be that LHCBM1 interacts with LHCSR1 preventing its degradation. In the abstract, and discussion, as no interaction data is shown, consider toning down statements regarding LHCBM1 interaction with LHCSR3. - Discussion, discuss whether similar results were observed for the npq4 mutant (increased antenna size in HL and less functional PSII observed in npq5). Is this phenotype linked to the low NPQ capacity or specific to the lower level of LHCBM1 in the npq5 mutant? Minor comments - Please give a title to summarize the first result in Fig. 1. In the result section, consider making the section subtitles more informative about the main result from that section (e.g., “Photoprotection capacity after high-light acclimation” could be “NPQ induction is severely hampered in npq5 after high-light acclimation”). - Page 3, method, actinic light of 1,500 μmol photons.m-2.s-1 (and saturating pulses of 12,000 μmol photons.m-2.s-1) are used for the fluorescence measurements. Comment on the choice of such a high light intensity (and high intensity pulses, actinic effect?). Why not use a light intensity closer to the HL treatment? Also state length of dark-acclimation prior to each type of measurement. - Immunoblot method, state dilutions used and secondary antibody type and dilution used. - Page 4, it is stated that “the level of the other LHCBMs is similar to that of WT (CC-425)” by referring to Fig. S1 and S2. It is difficult to see in Fig. S1 that the level of other LHCBMs is similar in npq5 and WT as the data is represented in percentage of total LHCBMs. Could you also represent the amount of the different LHCBMs in npq5 normalized to WT in a bar graph? For the Type III and Type II/I LHCBMs accumulation, a dilution series might be best for quantification to ensure that CP47 antibody signal is not saturated. In Fig. S1, npq5 should be italic. In Fig. S2, one of the labels is likely wrong: there are two 48h time points. By biological replica, is it meant three independent batches of grown and treated cells? What is the fourth band right below the upper band detected by the LHCBM5 antibody at 48h? - Fig. 5, please enlarge panels B and C to match panel A. - Fig. 6, specify in the legend that 24h and 48h refer to the HL treatment. - Discussion, “and confirmed here by analysis of the [ npq5 ] mutant” (not npq4) Jingfang Hao and Pierrick Bru (Umeå University) - not prompted by a journal; this review was written within a preprint  journal club with input from group discussion including Alizée Malnoë, Aurélie Crepin, Fadime Demirel, Jack Forsman and Domenica Farci.",2022-04-05T14:10:29,alizee_malnoe,Alizée Malnoë,10.1101/2022.01.13.476201,The role of LHCBM1 in non-photochemical quenching in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,"Xin Liu, Wojciech Nawrocki, Roberta Croce",2022-01-14

First, I absolutely agree that sampling more timepoints and more locations would certainly give us more insight into how consistent microbiome patterns are over space and time and with respect to infection status. But since this was the first such study in wild Daphnia microbiomes, we wanted to start with the simplest experiment design to establish that there were indeed microbiome changes correlating with infection (the clear differences we found were surprising given that these animals were taken directly from the field; we expected far greater variation between replicates, and we also expected any signal associated with infection to be weak, see lines 268-271.) This site was chosen based on routine infection prevalence monitoring data: we chose the site that had the highest infection rate so we could collect enough animals for the study. The samples were not stored, processing began immediately and was completed within 24 hours of the Daphnia being collected from the lake; during this time they were kept at room temperature in filtered lake water. For coverage, we plotted rarefaction curves (number of OTUs versus sequencing depth) and found that that the curves even out around 65,000 reads for all samples, suggesting we discovered most OTUs that were present. We used the UNOISE algorithm to remove chimeras. Clustering the OTUs at the standard 97% sequence similarity accounts for possible PCR and sequencing errors, so we avoided classifying each strain variant as a separate OTU. We did not use qPCR or culturing to quantify bacterial load, so all our 16S results refer to relative abundances only. This would be a very interesting question to persue, but both these methods have their associated biases: 16S qPCRs would pick up dead bacteria whereas culturing would only detect culturable bacteria. We did use a 16S qPCR as part of the standard library preparation procedure to avoid overamplifying the samples. We did not correct for 16S gene copy number or variance in genome sizes, and we acknowledge that this remains a general limitation in microbiome studies; it is also difficult to correct for since most OTUs were only identified till the Order or Family level, and gene copy number can vary within a genus. In the results: thank you for pointing out these issues. The horizontal spread of points in Fig. 2 do not convey information. Clustering points in Fig. 3 was a little challenging due to the variation between replicates, but we will continue to work on improving all figures. Thank you for your time and I hope this answers your questions. I look forward to another discussion if need be!

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.26.477801v1#comment-5816694139,biorxivstage,3,"Dear Antonio Fernández-Guerra, We have read your comment with interest and surprise, as we always recognised your preprint paper openly, citing Vanni et al. (2020) in our manuscript and even referring to it as a foundational study in the field. We understand that we work on a similar topic and use similar methods and terminology but, as we hope to clarify here, our data, analyses and biological findings are conceptually and technically different from those presented in Vanni et al. In any case, we took your letter as constructively as possible and we would be happy to include our analyses and comparisons as additional references and supplementary materials in upcoming revisions of our manuscript, as we are confident that both studies do not overlap as expressed in your comments. A full point-by-point response* to your original letter is available at https://zenodo.org/record/6411122, where we address the following aspects: * The content of our response letter was shared, reviewed and agreed by the authors of Vanni et al. prior to publication . Summary: 1. Rodríguez del Río et al, *does cite* Vanni et al., as well as other relevant methodological advances developed by their co-authors, such as MMSeqs2 and Linclust, explicitly acknowledging them as a foundational work and therefore allowing any interested reader to trace the origin of novel ideas. 2. Rodriguez et al. and Vanni et al. have a completely different focus. a. Vanni et al. focused on developing a methodology for unifying known and unknown protein families. They demonstrated how this strategy can reduce the number of unknowns in metagenomics datasets, and analyzed the diversity and lineage-specificity of functionally unknown protein clusters vs the known ones using metagenomic and genomic gene catalogs. Focus: novel methods and known vs unknown comparisons. b. Rodríguez del Río et al. focused on characterizing a subset of high-quality predictions of unknown protein families that are unique from uncultivated lineages, non-orphan and under strong selection; further delineating novel protein families that i) co-occur in the same genome of species from particular lineages, ii) are potentially associated with specific metabolic pathways or iii) represent putative synapomorphic traits for high-rank uncultivated lineages. Focus: characterizing the unique genetic repertory of uncultivated taxa. 3. All findings in Rodriguez del Río et al. refer to a conceptually different set of data as compared to Vanni et al. a. In Vanni et al. most analyses refer to a generic classification of protein families into functionally known versus unknown, without distinguishing between those present in cultured and uncultured species, nor discarding orphan genes (e.g. ~60% of their lineage-specific clusters are species-specific). b. In Rodríguez del Río et al., all results and biological interpretations refer to a subset of protein families within the unknown category that are exclusive from uncultivated organisms, not orphan, and having particular genomic properties (e.g. under strong purifying selection). No results are reported that refer to comparisons between known and unknown protein families, and no results can be extrapolated to the general pool of unknowns. 4. Rodríguez del Río et al. focused on maximizing the quality of predictions, while Vanni et al. used a comprehensive approach. a. The unknown protein families predicted in Rodríguez del Río et al. were inferred based on mostly full-length genes that span more than one species, contain a conserved region of at least 20aa, have expression data/predictions, are under purifying selection, have no obvious homologs in cultured species, and have a reference genome to infer reliable taxonomic annotations and genomic contexts. As a result, all protein clusters with detectable homologs in cultured species and the vast majority of the unknowns were discarded and not included in subsequent analyses. b. Vanni et al. used a comprehensive approach for most of their biological analyses, using a set of clusters that might be over-split, due to the large number of fragmented genes present in metagenomics (as recognised in their own paper)  and orphan genes (i.e. no homologs beyond species level). 5. Major findings in Rodriguez del Río et al. are novel and do not overlap with the observations in Vanni et al. a. Rodríguez del Río et al. reconstructed the genomic context and calculated synteny conservation for over 400k unknown protein families, delineating particular cases embedded in highly conserved functional contexts associated with key metabolic processes. In Vanni et al., genomic context conservation is shallowly showcased as an example of the potential of their approach. b. Rodríguez del Río et al., identified uncultivated lineages where individual organisms contain a striking number of the selected *subset* of unknown protein families from their catalog (i.e. high-quality, uncultivated-only, not-orphan novel fams per genome), linking them to potential functional roles; which does not compare with the observations reported in Vanni et al. By contrast, and although the data sets used are not equivalent, results in Rodriguez del Río et al. would largely contradict the main observation made in Vanni et al. about the Patescibacteria phylum having the greatest content of unknowns (see section 3). c. Rodríguez del Río et al. predicted over 900 novel protein families as putative synapomorphic traits for high-rank uncultivated lineages. This is, novel traits that are both highly specific and prevalent for all organisms under a given lineage. In their letter, Vanni et al. confronted their lineage-specificity (LS) results with our synapomorphic predictions, which are not comparable. As we show in section 4 of this report, the LS results shown by Vanni et al. would be incorrect if interpreted as synapomorphies. Most importantly, Vanni et al never discussed any protein family that could potentially represent a synapomorphic trait at basal taxonomic levels, and only brought this claim in their letter. d. Rodríguez del Río et al. reported putative synapomorphic protein families at high-rank levels as traits of great evolutionary significance, showing that they are also under stronger selective pressures than other unknown families. The results in Vanni et al. do not compare conceptually or technically with any of those findings: they report that functionally unknown protein families are more phylogenetically conserved than the known ones, which addresses a different question, performs a different comparison and uses a different metric than in Rodriguez del Río et al. (see section 5 for additional data). e. The subset of unknown protein families predicted in Rodriguez del Río et al. inverts the ecological patterns observed in Vanni et al. and Coelho et al. (see section 6) i. Vanni et al. reported functionally unknown genes to be ecologically narrow, acknowledging the existence of a small fraction of broadly distributed families in all the protein family categories (known and unknown). ii. Rodríguez del Río et al. demonstrate that the subset of predictions delineated with their analyses are largely widespread across samples and biomes, and most are not associated with mobile elements. f. Rodríguez del Río et al. make available an online resource to graphically explore and interpret their predictions ( https://novelfam.cgmlab.org), which is largely different both in content and form from the AGNOSTOS database released in Vanni et al. ( https://doi.org/10.6084/m9..... 6. The methods used in Rodriguez del Río et al. are standard in the field, already published, and properly cited. (see section 8) a. The methodology used to identify novel gene families does not follow the approach presented in Vanni et al, but the one published by us and colleagues in Salazar et al, 2019. In such work, published prior to Vanni et al., we already described a method to unify known and unknown protein families using genomic and metagenomic data, which we also used to predict putative functions of unknown metagenomic protein families based on co-expression analyses. b. Rodríguez del Río el al. used AntiFam to locate spurious sequences, which is a generic procedure.  We don't think this should be taken as a lack of recognition to Vanni et al. c.  Rodríguez del Río el al. mapped their predictions to the most relevant catalog of unknown, but putatively functional, small peptides (Sberro et al. 2019); which is properly cited. We don't think this should be taken as a lack of recognition to Vanni et al. d. Rodríguez del Río et al mapped all their predictions to Price et al. to provide further hints on their putative functional roles. Vanni et al. used one example from Price et al. to showcase the use of genomic context for functional analyses. We don't know how our use of Price et al. could mean a lack of recognition to Vanni et al. e. Rodíguez del Río et al. developed their own ad hoc method to identify and date synapomorphic traits at high-rank levels, which is, as we show in section 4, conceptually different from the method used in Vanni et al.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.29.458100v1#comment-5814982455,biorxivstage,1,"Manuscript reviewed for Reviewer Mentor Program, SfN working with Mike X. Cohen as my mentor in Fall 2021: In this study, authors used high-density probes to perform large-scale neural recordings for identifying and characterizing the coordinated activity across MEC grid-cell modules in the presence and absence of visual cues. Authors aim to show that the inter-module activity in MEC is coordinated even in visual-sensory deprived conditions. The study is well-designed to test the hypothesis that local networks within MEC can calibrate the inter-module activity even in absence of visual feedback of animals' spatial location. With the cutting edge experimental and statistical tools, this study provides novel insights into the role of MEC activity in maintaining a coherent cognitive map. There are a few concerns about module classification, and application and validity of dimensionality reduction technique. Major concerns: The exact definition of the term ""module"" is unclear, and a more precise definition will help readers understand the impact of the findings. For example, is a module defined by a specific volume of tissue, or number of cells in a volume, or a number of cells within a network showing toroidal topology manifolds, or functional connectivity? Relatedly, what are the estimated physical dimensions of the modules in EC? Are different cell types part of each module across layers? How different are the probabilities that two cells with correlated activity could belong either to the same or different module (line 9-13 on page 5)? It is an interesting observation that grid cell modules retain the coordination even when mapping between grid cell activity and position deteriorates (line 23-24 on page 5). What does the coordination in such a case reflect, if not position? Are there any scenarios where position decoding is possible even when grid cell modules do not retain coordination? Are there any sessions when light recording is followed by dark session to compare the change in grid cell coordination across light-then-dark sessions? (line 37 on page 5) In line 37 on page 5, light recording sessions have a broader duration range of 30-60min. Is it possible that the difference in the duration of dark vs light sessions led to a systematic bias? It may be helpful for readers to compare the ratio of time in dark vs. light for all the individual animals or comparing the total time for each animal in dark (all dark session durations combined) and light (all light session durations combined). Similarly to prevent the doubts about systematic bias in spiking data (line 1 on page 6), it would be helpful to compare the ratio of spikes in light vs dark for each of the 842 grid cells identified in the experiments. Including the information about temporal distribution of spikes would also be helpful to address whether all the grid cells were active for full session or they varied their activity within different epochs of a session i.e were all 500+ spikes spread homogeneously over full session? McInnes et al mentions that UMAP is more reliable for large datasets and UMAP assumes there is manifold structure in the data. Considering this along with the fact that the number of datapoints processed through UMAP in this study are very close to the lower limit for UMAP, are there other alternate dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g. PHATE which may be more suitable for the size of datasets for this study) that lead to similar conclusions in this study? Could authors quantify the false positives that could occur due to limitations of UMAP in clustering of grid cells into different modules? Also, could authors demonstrate the reliability of module classification e.g. through cross-validation or split-half reliability? According to Roy et al 2000 (Neural Computation), low firing rates (<10spikes/s) often lead to spurious correlations. Hence, it may be helpful to compare the likelihood for actual, not down-sampled, mean-firing rate between light and dark. Also, considering the issue with correlations for low-rate spike trains, are there any alternative methods to best estimate inter-module coordination other than pairwise correlations? What are the approximate dimensions of the brain region around the tip of a tetrode vs a recording site on the neuropixel probes used in this study? If they are considerably different, should tetrode data have comparable statistical interdependence across modules as we expect for neuropixel probes? If not, it brings to question the validity of applying the statistical methods used for tetrode data to neuropixel data. Figure 2 and Supplementary Fig.2 - module classification and clustering issue: Supp Fig 2 - Grid M3 in ‘a’ and M2 in ‘c’ appear too close to the respective non-grid clusters, do the results hold if such grids are excluded from the data? Minor concerns: Introduction - Line 6-9: “the recurrent ...sensory inputs.” - a reference for this statement would be helpful. It may be useful to mention in discussion about which spatial encoding mechanism would render grid-cell coordination sustain in darkness? Odor cues and Path integration? (Fischler-Ruiz et al 2021 Cell), Step-count? Proprioception? Page 4 – line 1-2: “The grid cells within a module encode together a two dimensional quantity which, in some conditions – could be dissociated from the true position of the animal” It is not clear why authors mention this fact. It may be helpful to relate this to the findings. Page 4 - Line 14-16 – “Since population activity of an individual module lies on a two-dimensional manifold, the joint activity of M modules spans, at least in principle, a 2M dimensional space” Reference for Mathematical principle on which this statement is based.? References for this statement supporting whether the joint activity of M modules spans at least 2M dimensional space or different? Please add references for the statement in Line 8-9 on page 5. Line 16-18 – “However, during continuous motion…..the state of each module is faithfully mapped to the location of the animal in two dimensional space”. What is the definition of continuous motion (3cm/s?)? How consistent is it across the studies on spatial encoding of Ent cortex.? If there is tactile/olfactory feedback in the dark, would the modules represent increased accuracy of encoding spatial location? Line 26: For clarity, ‘rate adjusted likelihood’ could be referred to in the manuscript as ‘likelihoodRA’ instead of just ‘likelihood’.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.16.460656v2#comment-5809613204,biorxivstage,2,"In this paper, the author uses innovative SVD rotation methods to analyze previous serial crystallography datasets with the aim of delineating retinal isomerization in bacteriorhodopsin (bR). This analysis reveals novel intermediate states that lend insight into how the transition takes place as well as the role played by residues in bR’s active site. The author hypothesizes that a non-specific Coulomb attraction force triggers sampling of multiple cis conformations and single bond rotations in retinal, but the selection of the 13-cis conformation is achieved by the stereochemical constraints in the protein environment. The author lays out the major questions of the paper very clearly in the introduction and the results and discussion sections remain well-focused on answering those questions. The mathematical and computational methods presented here demonstrate how they can be used to tease out the intermediates from “multi” datasets (as shown by the author in his other publications). We share the author’s frustration that “never-observed dataset reconstituted from a collection of experimental datasets does not match the well-established crystallographic template of PDB” - there are interesting new directions in joint refinement across datasets that are considered siloed by the PDB - and this paper contributes well to that frontier. Overall, the paper is well written and the methods section is particularly instructive in the general approach, but lacking details that would allow us to follow the exact implementation used for this paper. Major Points: 1. Overall: no statement on data/code availability is given. Even if proprietary software is used, it is essential to know what options are used and to have a detailed protocol to reproduce the work. 2. The author comments on how timepoints from the Kovacs et al drive the vectors of interest (U10, U14, U17), yet it’s challenging to differentiate the insights gained from the SVD over FO-FO maps from Kovacs. We suggest a quantitative comparison showing signal-to-noise or goodness of fit which may help the reader interpret the benefits gained from SVD. 3. While the methods section is quite detailed in describing how SVD is performed and how the Ren rotations retain the orthonormal properties of the SVD, the details of how the angles for rotations are chosen are not given. The author says “SVD analysis presented in this paper employs rotations extensively” but what angles of rotations were sampled? Which were the good rotations and which were the bad rotations? A read-through of the earlier papers of the author (Ren 2019, Ren 2016) did not provide answers for these questions either (with large portions of the text in the methods sections being nearly identical between these papers) We infer this is using the software “Dynamix” based on the Acknowledgements. While it is understandable that decisions on what rotations need to be done are subjective, it is imperative that the author guides the reader through these decisions to help in reproduction/application of this method. Without these details it is difficult to know, for example, whether the oscillatory vectors are related to particular choices in the SVD procedure or are relatively without bias. 4. Majority of datasets are clustered in the current SVD iteration - did another Ren rotation not separate Kovacs datasets according to an interesting piece of metadata? This seems like an opportunity to rotate the SVD and further demonstrate the utility of the Ren rotation method. 5. The author shows the oscillatory behavior of 5 pairs of components in figure S3. But how did he arrive at these 5 pairs? Did other pairs not show such kind of oscillatory behavior? 6. The author goes into fine details of the intermediate conformations of retinal and shows differences in distances in the range of less than an angstrom. Is there a goodness-of-fit metric that can be used by the author to show that the atomic positions determined by the author are indeed the best/only possible positions? What if there is another intermediate conformation of retinal that fits equally well into the densities but does not have the S-shaped creasing? How do these conformations navigate the need to fit to density without being too high energy? Minor points: 1. Labeling of “inboard” and “outboard” terms can be done in main Figure 1 rather than referring reader to S1 2. Figure 2(b): overall trend is useful, might there be an easier way to visualize? Some sort of 1D - distance plot of integrated intensities? 3. Panel C in figure 2 is cited extensively in the text. Rather than mentioning the sub-panels as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd panel, etc., the author could just split panel c into d,e,f, etc. 4. Figure 2(c) - lines are difficult to visualize. They could be made bold. The author could also reduce the panel to show only atomic displacement and torsion angle and move the rest to supplement if necessary, so that the two main plots could be made bigger for easier interpretation. 5. Figure 1(c) and Figure 3(a) & (b) are very difficult to interpret. The author can zoom in further and use translucent volume rendering rather than mesh 6. Figure 3(d) - The author could label as “helix A, B, …, G” so that it’s immediately obvious what’s shown in figure, otherwise a nice illustration of motion 7. Figure 3(e) retinal could be color coded or more easily separated from amino acids to make it easier and faster to interpret. 8. The maps of I’ (Fig S6), I (Fig S7), J’ (Fig S9) and J (Fig S10) are contoured at different sigma levels presumably due to the Fo contributions differing based on the reconstitution procedure. Is there any trend in the reconstitution that would guide us to calibrate what sigma levels to be equivalent across datasets, or is this purely visual?

Therefore, I will comment primarily on the MR physics/interpretation, whereas the morphometric analysis and anatomical interpretations are better suited for another reviewer. Recommendation: Major revision This is an ambitious article that helps 7T deliver on its promise of high-resolution MRI. The authors acquired T1 and T2* weighted images at 0.35mm isotropic resolution on 5 healthy participants. They implemented a correction for blood motion artifacts, as well as a cortical analysis toolbox for visualizing and characterizing the cortical surface. Additionally they fitted for T1 and T2* maps. The authors have shared the data and the code, making it easier to fill in some gaps that are present in the manuscript. The authors believe that their work will bring mesoscopic imaging to clinical practice because of (i) their protocol, (ii) their post-processing tools and (iii) their high-quality qMRI datasets. The images are impressive, even though the coverage is limited (~3cm in the inferior-superior direction). The correction works well, and the analysis appears robust, even though some basic SNR/CNR measurements are missing. I also believe that it is a little too early to perform quantitative MRI on such datasets (see points 3 and 4 below). I would suggest performing phantom studies before moving on to in vivo qMRI maps. Below are some comments/suggestions to improve the manuscript. MAJOR COMMENTS 1. I was missing a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. In particular, a discussion of SNR would have been very useful to evaluate the efficiency of the scans. While the protocol is relatively fast, the coverage is also limited, and a visual assessment is not enough to convince me of the quality of the images. A proper SNR analysis combined with histograms would be useful. For example, in Figure 2 it appears that compositing reduces the contrast. Not sure what happens to the SNR and CNR, would be important to get those numbers and how much the post-processing changes them. 2. Related to the above point: the authors share the raw data, but these are very large datasets and OSF download speeds are low. After downloading the zipped data I received a message that I cannot expand it ( screenshot), so I was not able to inspect the images. Also, the shared scripts appear well-documented, but I was not able to reproduce the analysis because of too many dependencies. A combination of Jupyter notebooks and containers (possibly via MyBinder) would make it much easier to reproduce the analysis. 3. Figure 1: The quantitative MRI maps do not have units/colormaps, so it is very difficult to evaluate them. For example, there appears to be a strong B1 effect, so more details about the B1 transmit/receive would be important for qMRI validation. Why weren’t field maps acquired? Also, the 2D histograms are informative, but for qMRI it is essential to conduct scan-rescan to determine the stability of the images and accompanying maps. 4. Related to the above point, in Figure 9 there seems to be a bias in the T1 values between the left and right Heschl’s gyrus. And in Figures 8 and 10 one can notice that the extreme percentiles (red lines) of one subject interact with the medians (white lines) of another subject. Is there a physiological interpretation for this, or could it be a field effect? In general, without reliable B0/B1 one could have significant non-uniformities and offsets that could translate into inaccurate quantitative MRI maps. 5. p. 17. What was the reason for the chosen bandwidth and the 6/8 partial Fourier? Was there a time limit to the acquisition? On p. 17 the authors argue that they were hoping to reduce acquisition times, but neither points above are big time-savers and would improve the quality of the images.

The paper shows that Desmodium releases volatiles, as we also demonstrate. However, it is quite apparent from their data that it does not do so constitutively: the various extracts that were used were highly variable in release rates, which is typical for induction. The high levels of green-leaf volatiles reported, which were absent in our samples, are also a telltale sign of damage. In the paper, maize also released some volatiles, indicating some above or below ground herbivore induction too. But, without the critical data on volatile release following controlled herbivore damage (i.e. a positive control) or internal standards, it is difficult to assess the results. In contrast, our carefully collected data shows that when unchallenged, neither Desmodium, nor maize release volatiles. We have analyzed hundreds of samples from various geographic locations (Sweden, Tanzania, Uganda, South Africa), from the greenhouse and the field, using different soils and microbial augmentations, using entrainments as well as SPME. All these samples, without exception, show that undamaged Desmodium does not release the ‘push’ volatiles constitutively (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes), while Melinis does constitutively release a diversity of terpenes in very large quantities. As we know, plants generally do not release volatiles constitutively. Some do, often through glandular trichomes (e.g. Melinis), which Desmodium lacks. Upon induction Desmodium indeed releases volatiles, but it is low compared to induced maize and Melinis. Between brackets, the above also shows that differences in methodology (SPME versus entrainments) cannot explain the differences between the studies, which was perhaps implied by Prof. Bruce’s comment. However, most significant is that our large number of field collections demonstrate that Desmodium rarely and minimally releases volatiles in the field, even though most plants showed some herbivore damage. In contrast, maize releases substantial amounts and a large diversity of terpenes. To be at the basis of reducing Lepidoptera pest pressure in maize, Desmodium would have to reliably and at high levels release volatiles in the field, whether induced or constitutively. Ironically, if pest reduction would depend on volatiles, maize seems to do a much better job. Indeed, our data also show that whole Desmodium plants did not repel S. frugiperda from ovipositing on maize plants. Our research provides the first experimental evidence that Desmodium does not constitutively release volatiles, and only minimally and unreliably in the field, in response to herbivory. This is very different from what has been suggested over the last two decades (in the absence of data), and implies that the pest suppressive role of Desmodium is due to other mechanisms. We provide such an alternative mechanism: Desmodium is a catch crop that truncates larval development and kills insects. Such observations have been made in the somewhat grey literature, with even vertebrates found to be captured by Desmodium. Obviously, how the mechanism exactly plays out in the field under various conditions needs further detailed field studies. Knowing the exact mechanisms of pest suppression is critical to further improve the maize intercropping system, and to rationally translate such sustainable pest suppressive intercropping methods in other cropping systems. We are keen on teasing out the interplay of mechanisms together with other researchers, particularly at icipe, who designed the system in the first place.

I quickly glanced through your manuscript and am intrigued by supplementary Figure 12. It looks to me that in some cell types Yap (transcript?) level correlates extraordinarily well with total transcript level (if I understood those panels correctly) whereas in others there is no correlation at all. This pattern is not seen with Myc or Mtor. I am wondering if these data suggest that the correlation between Yap and hypertranscription is selective for cell-type, whereas Mtor (and maybe Myc) is more generic. Furthermore, YAP protein activity/stability is highly regulated, which may also affected your analysis, which I assume is based on transcript levels. For the ChEA data analysis, I wonder whether YAP's preferential binding for enhancers (versus Myc for promoters) may have an effect on the result.",2022-03-24T22:51:01,xinweicao,Xinwei Cao,10.1101/2021.12.13.472426,Absolute Scaling of Single-Cell Transcriptomes Reveals Pervasive Hypertranscription in Adult Stem and Progenitor Cells,"Yun-Kyo Kim, Miguel Ramalho-Santos",2021-12-13

Minimizing the number of rounds of PCR reduces the sequencing error rate and fraction of chimeric sequences. I did see that you used universal primers to amplify the V4 region of the 16sRNA gene. Likewise, your methods section mentions quality filtering with VSEARCH, but other specifics are limited. I appreciate you considering both the dominant and rare taxa appropriately, and your handling and preparation of samples prior to DNA extraction was spot on. Further, OTU abundance was calculated by mapping the total quality-filtered paired reads to the final clusters, with the resulting abundances normalized by the total 16s rRNA gene copy numbers as estimated through qPCR, and differences in copy numbers across samples were evaluated with an aligned Rank Transformation of a Factorial Model with the R package ARTool. This method was explained well and is thorough. What about measuring sequencing coverage of the communities? Also, I did not see any mention of internal standards at the PCR step or the DNA extraction step. While I did see that resulting sequence reads were quality-trimmed, what was the total number of sequences obtained per sample and how many after quality filtering (and what criteria are used for quality filtering)? Thank you in advance, as I look forward to hearing back from you.",2022-03-24T17:28:30,disqus_sKGT69OJhz,Amanda Walton,10.1101/861260,Acetobacteraceae in the honey bee gut comprise two distant clades with diverging metabolism and ecological niches,"G Bonilla-Rosso, C Paredes Juan, S Das, KM Ellegaard, O Emery, M Garcia-Garcera, N Glover, N Hadadi, JR van der Meer, SAGE class 2017-18, F Tagini, P Engel",2019-12-06

I am surprised however that no mention is made of the possible influence of the treadmill on these effects. We have shown that both dual-task costs and task prioritization differ between overground and treadmill walking in healthy adults and therefore, presumably, their ability to reallocate resources. I would expect this to have some implication for these findings.",2022-03-24T01:19:50,james_wrightson,James Wrightson,10.1101/2022.03.18.484948,Young adults who improve performance during dual-task walking show more flexible reallocation of cognitive resources: A Mobile Brain-Body Imaging (MoBI) study,"Eleni Patelaki, John J.

What is the PCR target region, primers used, # of cycles? The PCR target region was V4 and 30 cycles were run. The primers used were never listed. The article also failed to provide the temperatures and duration of the cycles. 2. Does the bioinformatics method include steps to minimize PCR errors and chimeras? The “quality screening” in mothur should be explicit as to the filtering procedures. 3. Given that microbial communities are uneven and dominated, does the analysis focus on the dominant taxa, and consider the rate taxa appropriately? The relative abundance of C. diff was shown in supp fig 2, but no data or analysis of dominate taxa was given. 4. How are samples taken and handled before DNA extraction? Mice were given antibiotics and orally given C. difficile spores, then cecal samples were removed from their corpses. The cecal samples were then ground in a mortar and stored at -80 degrees. 5. Are OTU abundances corrected for variance in 16S copy number and for variances in genome size? No. 6. Is sequencing coverage of the communities measured and it is complete? No coverage measures were mentioned. # of sequence per sample not given. No rarefaction curves shown. 7. Does the PCR step contain internal standards? the DNA extraction step? the sequencing step? No, none of the three steps contained internal standards. 8. Is the sampling strategy well described and appropriate for the microbiome of interest? Yes, a description can be found in question 2, and it is appropriate for the microbiome. 9. Can you see total number of sequences obtained per sample and how many after quality filtering (and what criteria are used for quality filtering)? No and filtering steps were not described in detail. 10. 16S profile is normalized. Does the study also use some method to quantify total bacterial numbers, like qPCR or culture? The study measures bacterial metabolites as a quantification method. Additional Comments: The experiment lacked an obvious control group. The method of chimera screening was not stated, only the database used.",2022-03-23T22:47:26,trey_baker,Trey Baker,10.1101/092304,Clostridium difficile colonizes alternative nutrient niches during infection across distinct murine gut microbiomes,"Matthew L.
