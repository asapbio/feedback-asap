The link between migration and differentiation is particularly intriguing, with premature dendritic protrusion formation upon migration disruption.

Still i don't like dogmatic statements like that you ""overturn decades of animal and human research"", particularly as part of these studies revealed 'real' neural activity and receptive fields with neurophysiology rather than fMRI. What you probably show is that the mapping between SI and higher cortical areas remains stable resulting in a stable top-down induced SI map. (I would not expect that these top-down structural or functional connections change.) This might be as correct as findings by others that the bottom-up sensory driven map changes drastically. The mismatch between both is a reason for phantom sensations and pain and, as previously shown, could be overcome by the use of myoelectric prostheses or sensory re-training. What I am missing is the all-or-nothing maps for the pre-amputation sessions for comparison. Another question: what exactly is the tapping task:  do they 'tap' against an object or their palm (resulting in a 'sensory' phantom stimulation) or is it a pure motor task? The final question to all of us should not be: ""Which findings and conclusions are correct?"" but ""How can we integrate your and previous findings in a joint and coherent model of functional cortical organization and plasticity?""",2025-05-28T09:37:08,neurolabjacobs,NeuroLab@CU,10.1101/2023.12.13.571314,Stable Cortical Body Maps Before and After Arm Amputation,"Hunter R.

But succinate does not have the capacity to succinylate, succinyl-CoA does. Succinate and succinyl-CoA are in equilibrium through succinyl-CoA ligase, and as I saw in their slides that they are able to knock-down (or knock out) both isoforms (ATP- and GTP-  isoforms of succinyl-CoA ligase) by knocking down or out SUCLG1, the common subunit. A lot of succinate, means a lot of succinyl-CoA through reverse operation of succinyl-CoA ligase.

Considering Burmese pythons are born with a mass of ~100g and can reach ~100.000g, it almost has to be the case that hyperplasia underlies some/most/all of the ~1.000-fold growth. Tracking mitosis of cardiomyocytes is notoriously difficult in mammals, in part due to the challenge of verifying which cell type the cell-cycle-positive nuclei belongs to, e.g. endothelial vs. fibroblast vs. cardiomyocyte (e.g. PMID: 20457832). Detection of the cardiomyocyte-expressed PCM1 has alleviated the situation substantially (PMID: 26073943). In reptiles however, it has been suggested the situation is more challenging because of a relatively small size of cardiomyocytes and at present there is not an equivalent marker to PCM1 (PMID: 31712265). In the present manuscript, the authors use a good marker of cell cycle activity (pHH3) and the immunohistochemical detection of cytoplasmic sarcomeres (= cardiomyocyte cytoplasm) is also good; however, it is far from clear how the authors correctly assign a pHH3-positive nucleus to its cardiomyocyte cytoplasm (especially when markers of endothelial cells and fibroblasts are not employed). The shown microscopy in the present manuscript is almost interchangeable with didactic examples of the false-positives shown in Figure 2 of PMID: 20457832. When the authors report on pHH3 detection, the values are double-corrected, first for tissue area (good) and then converted to fold change. The second step renders the reported values too abstract and it is difficult to understand which measurements varied between samples and treatments. The authors, surprisingly, interpret the transcriptomic signatures of cell cycle activity as stemming from the cardiomyocytes, whereas the cardiomyocytes (likely) only comprise one-quarter to one-third of the total number of cells of the heart (e,g, PMID: 26846633). That is, a priori one could expect most of the cell cycle activity to originate from endothelial cells and fibroblasts rather than cardiomyocytes. The authors conduct the interesting experiment of applying plasma from fed pythons to neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. They have previously done this with plasma from pythons 3 days into digestion (which allegedly induces hypertrophy). It then seems like a missed opportunity that the authors did not run in parallel batches of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes treated with 3DPF plasma (hypertrophy?) and 6DPF (hyperplasia?). The authors are attempting an interesting study while there is scope for increasing the weight of the evidence.",2025-05-25T13:33:25,,Bjarke Jensen,10.1101/2025.05.19.654898,Dynamic hyperplastic cardiac growth in Burmese pythons,"Yuxiao Tan, Thomas G.

My team did a journal club about it (see https://bsky.app/profile/mbarse.bsky.social/post/3lps3ygzicc2a for details), as our colleagues are considering using your approach for a new dataset. The pre-print is well written and easy to follow, kudos to you! If you have time, I'd greatly appreciate if you could answer some questions we have. ## Question 1: applicability to other brain regions * Figure 3d and Table 2 show two set of confidence bands (narrow and wide), which would lead to excluding 4.9% or 12.75% of the cells respectively. That's when using data from the same brain region for both training the model and applying the model. Figure 5 shows the results from training the model in data from the VTA brain region and then applying it to the NAc brain region. How do the confidence bands look like in this case? Is the percent of cells excluded in those bands similar to the results from Figure 3d and Table 2? It's hard to guess this from comparing Figure 3b and Figure 5c. * For context to the above question, we are wondering whether we would have to train the model on new data or not before we can apply it to another brain region (not the VTA). If the answer is that the % of cells excluded doesn't change much, then there's not that much to gain from re-training the model on data from the same new brain region (which would involve generating pilot data if none is publicly available). Of course, assuming the cell types are somewhat similar in both brain regions: particularly the sex-dependent effects on neuron transcriptional activity. ## Question 2: code We appreciate that you shared your code on GitHub (we checked version https://github.com/Jeremy-Day-Lab/Twa_etal_2024/tree/2cf2eff2241a8caf9e1405c2f29b6e68f1d6850e). In particular, the ""sex-prediction-model"" HTML and Qmd files are very comprehensive. However, we haven't been able to find your model predictions. It seems to me that we would need to re-run some of your analyses before being able to apply your method to new data. Maybe this is outside the outscope of your project, but, do you plan on providing the objects and some easy to follow steps for applying your models to other data? Maybe you are planning on converting some of your code into functions and bundling them together as an R/Bioconductor package. If you have questions about that process, we can help a bit.

I also want to emphasize that our work does not claim novelty in the use of autoregressive (AR) models to estimate timescales. As stated in the preprint, AR models are used in a number of other published studies: Kaneoke et al. (2012), Meisel et al. (2017), Huang et al. (2018), Lurie et al. (2024), Shinn et al. (2023), and Shafiei et al. (2020). Our main contribution is in the estimation of standard errors for valid statistical inference and hypothesis testing, not in the use of AR models to get point estimates. We formalize and evaluate the assumptions and theoretical properties of the method, accounting for when the fitted data is not autoregressive. Whereas your approach improves model fits to neural activity by incorporating intrinsic, seasonal, and exogenous parameters, we focused on simpler single-parameter models, emphasizing adjustments for potential misspecification to support valid inference.

Why were Scx+ and Scx-lineage cells so few-to-no in the hematoma and callus in the long bone midshaft fracture model? Several published abstracts/papers using the same models showed substantial Scx+ or Scx-lineage cells within the callus 7 days or 14 days post fracture. Are you sure this data is correct or integral? Why don't you use multiplex-IF or multi-reporter model to verify the relationships of Scx-lineage cells and Prg4-lineage cells? We have to know clearly about their true identities to get biological explanations. 2. I don't understand why you do the so called second fracture experiments. What sense does it make? How do you distinguish the periosteum-sourced Td+ cells from the Td+ cells originating from any other structures after second fracture? There are many published examples showing different types of mesenchymal cells giving rise to other structures after long time lineage tracing. 3. Can you do some single cell RNA sequencing on the FAPs, Scx+ cells and fractured callus cells followed by trajectory analysis to show how they differentiate in vivo? That will be much stronger evidence for your final conclusions. 4. Can you do the muscle transfer experiments between Prg4ER/Td/DTA mice and their WT siblings followed by your cell ablation and fracture experiments? Because we know very well Prg4 labels superficial cartilage cells, tendon cells and any other cells expressing this proteoglycan for lubrication, there is no doubt that Prg4+ cell ablated model will have musculoskeletal movement disorder, healing defects and other phenotypes. How do you simply attribute this overall effect to your so-called Prg4+ FAPs by only using Prg4/DTA model?

This was one of the preprints that they reviewed. They provided a number of comments on the paper. The students fully acknowledge that they are not scientific experts. Nonetheless, they hope that some of their comments will be useful to the authors as they prepare their work for submission to a peer-reviewed journal. The interplay between diet, the gut microbiome, and cancer risk, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) was a fascinating topic for us to dive into. Finding links to gut chemistry with cancer risk in C57Bl/6 mice and human colorectal cancer patients, through investigating how a Western style diet affects gut microbial composition, sulfide production, and intestinal epithelial function through a combination of murine models and a meta-analysis of human patient data, we believe laid a strong foundation. These results suggest that sulfide metabolism serves as a functional biomarker for dietary impact on CRC risk, with gene expression analyses showing diet-driven suppression of sulfide detoxification enzymes in intestinal stem cells, particularly an enrichment of Erysipelotrichaceae leads to the strong possibility of CRC association. This dual species approach strengthens the relevance of the findings. However, there were some limitations in current methodologies, such as small sample sizes and insufficient controls for geographic dietary variation. Along with providing evidence of between Erysipelotrichaceae and high sulfide concentration in the gut. Despite these caveats, the study contributes meaningfully to the growing body of literature linking nutrition, microbiome dynamics, and oncogenesis. The findings warrant further exploration into metabolic pathways influenced by diet and underscore the need for broader, better controlled human studies to confirm causative links between microbial sulfur metabolism and colorectal cancer. Below are our group's critiques of the paper. Figure 1 presents an informative and visually accessible graph, though several refinements could improve its readability and clarity. One immediate issue is the placement of axis titles and labels, which currently overlap with axis ticks on both the x- and y-axes. Ensuring a clearer separation between these elements would enhance legibility. Additionally, the bacterial names on the graph may benefit from abbreviation or reformatting to make individual taxa easier to identify. Organizing the bacteria according to taxonomic hierarchy could also aid interpretation, helping readers quickly distinguish between different microbial groups and understand their relative significance. It would be useful to explicitly note in the figure legend that bacteria from the same taxonomy are color coded similarly, making visual groupings more intuitive. Furthermore, revising the color palette to accommodate colorblind friendly options would broaden accessibility and ensure all viewers can accurately interpret the data. The accompanying discussion of Figure 1 effectively contextualizes the findings and links them back to the overarching theme of diet and microbial sulfide production. One suggested edit for clarity and consistency is to revise the phrase “Importantly, we show that” to “Importantly, we showed that,” aligning with the past tense scientific narrative. Similarly, the assertion that “diet is the strongest determinant” of gut sulfide production might be more accurately phrased as “diet is a strong determinant,” since other potential influences were not investigated in the study. Supporting this revised claim with references to other research examining factors that affect gut sulfide production would help reinforce the conclusion. Notably, the concluding sentence “Thus, we posit that sulfide production can be considered a community level functional readout of dietary sulfur nutrient input that is potentially linked to multiple effects on the mucosa, including the intestinal remodeling characterizing IBD and tumor risk” is particularly effective. It succinctly captures the relevance of the findings and articulates their broader implications for understanding how diet may influence mucosal health and disease risk. Figure 2 aims to demonstrate that Erysipelotrichaceae abundance is elevated in mice fed the NWD1 diet compared to those fed the AIN control diet. While the figure successfully communicates a statistically significant difference—supported by the inclusion of both P- and Q-values (P = 0.019917, Q = 0.025892)—its overall presentation could be improved to enhance readability and interpretability. Most notably, the use of different shapes to represent mouse sex adds unnecessary complexity, as these distinctions are not analyzed or discussed within the figure or the main text. Similarly, the use of red and blue color coding for diet groups is redundant, given the clear labeling on the x-axis. Simplifying these elements and ensuring the figure employs a colorblind friendly palette would make the data more accessible. Importantly, statistical significance is only indicated in the caption, not visually within the figure itself. Including an asterisk or bold text to highlight the difference in NWD1 would make this clearer to readers. Additionally, the figure would benefit from stating the sample size directly, including clarification that both sexes were equally represented. Overlaying a median bar or converting the scatter plot to a box plot would also improve visual clarity, particularly where individual data points overlap. Although the inclusion of the P- and Q-values is appreciated, the caption does not describe how these values were calculated, nor does it provide adequate information on sample size, data collection methods, or statistical models used. For example, while the MaAsLin2 model incorporated ""Sex"" as a fixed effect, the figure and accompanying text do not explore whether an interaction exists between sex and diet—a potentially informative variable. This omission is particularly notable given the use of sex-based symbols in the graph. In terms of content relevance, the data in Figure 2 might be more appropriately placed in the supplementary material, particularly since Figure 3 appears to carry the narrative forward more directly. Supplemental figures like Figure 5, which show trends in microbial abundance over time for individual mice, are valuable for highlighting inter individual and potential sex-based variation. However, more detail should be provided on how bacterial groups were selected for inclusion, as well as on the decision-making process for which data were elevated to the main figures. Finally, while the use of standardized sequencing and DNA extraction methods (e.g., PowerFecal kit, V4-V5 region) strengthens methodological consistency, the absence of a control group to account for batch effects (such as collection date or sequencing run) is a limitation that should be addressed in future studies. In Figure 3 the study presents compelling associations between dietary intake, gut microbiota, and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, yet several aspects warrant deeper scrutiny and refinement. Notably, the experimental design utilized small cohorts, with only eight mice per diet group (n = 8), which limits statistical power and the generalizability of the findings. A central biochemical focus of the study is hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), which the authors implicate in mucosal damage. The original phrasing, “Sulfide has been shown to damage the mucosa by cleaving disulfide bonds found in mucus and has been linked with diseases with marked mucosal damage,” can be more clearly articulated as: “Sulfide cleaves disulfide bonds in mucosa, damaging the tissue and linking it to diseases with marked mucosal damage.” However, while this biochemical mechanism is plausible, the study lacks direct experimental evidence of mucosal degradation or impaired mucosal function, such as histological analysis or barrier function assays, to substantiate this claim within the context of their model. Furthermore, the relationship between Erysipelotrichaceae abundance and sulfide production remains correlative rather than causal. Although the meta-analysis shows an increased prevalence of Erysipelotrichaceae in CRC patients and mice on a Western style diet, no mechanistic data address whether this microbial family is directly responsible for enhanced sulfide synthesis. The current framing risks overstating the significance of Erysipelotrichaceae without isolating its metabolic role. Additionally, the claim that sulfide is a sufficient marker for mucosal damage and CRC risk oversimplifies the complex pathophysiology involved. Line 412-413 should be removed to avoid this overgeneralization, while retaining the more nuanced correlation stated in Line 411. Lastly, the diets used in the study differ across multiple nutritional variables, including fat, fiber, calcium, vitamin D, and sulfur containing amino acids. The conclusion attributing increased sulfide production to a single component overlooks this complexity. A more accurate interpretation would acknowledge the composite nature of the Western style diet and the need for controlled studies isolating specific dietary variables. Figure 4 provides valuable insights into how dietary interventions affect the expression of mitochondrial enzymes involved in sulfide metabolism, yet several improvements would enhance the clarity and interpretability of the data. Figure 4a offers a helpful schematic that illustrates the localization of sulfide detoxification enzymes—such as SQR (Sqrdl), ETHE1, SUOX, and TST—within mitochondrial structures and identifies the directionality of reactant flow. However, the figure would benefit from a more thorough introduction describing each enzyme’s specific role in sulfide detoxification and the broader significance of this pathway. Without this context, it is unclear why all four enzymes are studied, especially since ETHE1, SUOX, and TST appear to serve overlapping functions. Furthermore, the inconsistent labeling of sulfide quinone reductase-like protein referred to as SQR in Figure 4a and Sqrdl in Figure 4b and the text should be standardized across the manuscript to avoid confusion. The visual consistency between Figures 4a and 4b also requires attention, particularly the shading conventions, which imply relationships between data that are not explicitly connected. Figure 4b effectively illustrates differential gene expression between diet groups, demonstrating that expression of Ethe1, Suox, and Tst is significantly altered in response to the NWD1 diet. However, the figure would be clearer if significance were marked with asterisks above the relevant bars rather than listing precise p-values, which could instead be moved to the figure caption or results section. Importantly, Sqrdl expression did not show a significant difference, which raises interpretive questions. Including a hypothesis in the discussion about why Sqrdl expression was unchanged—despite the other enzymes showing significant variation—would help contextualize the data. Additionally, the discussion of these results would be strengthened by addressing why the observed changes in Ethe1, Suox, and Tst expression are biologically meaningful and warrant further study, as briefly noted in the concluding sentence of that section. Greater emphasis on the relevance of sulfide metabolism in intestinal stem cells could also help bridge the mechanistic findings to broader health implications, such as inflammation or tumor development. The associated methods section also lacks critical detail. The repeated mention of “bulk RNAseq” without a quantitative description (e.g., read depth, sample pooling strategy) is insufficient and should be clarified rather than deferring entirely to the Gene Expression Omnibus. Additionally, it is unclear how mRNA expression was normalized in the analysis—a fundamental detail that should be explicitly stated either in the methods or the figure caption. Lastly, phrasing such as “at sacrifice” could be revised to more standard terminology like “at the time of euthanasia” to maintain scientific professionalism. Addressing these issues would greatly enhance the transparency, rigor, and impact of the study’s findings. Figure 5 provides a valuable cross-species summary of the association between Erysipelotrichaceae taxa and colorectal cancer (CRC), but several refinements would improve its clarity, consistency, and interpretability. In Figure 5A, the addition of an x-axis label—specifically identifying it as the “AUC Score”—would aid reader comprehension, particularly for those unfamiliar with this metric. To further clarify the analysis, the figure caption or discussion should define the AUC (Area Under the Curve) score, explaining that scores below 0.5 may indicate taxa enriched in CRC cases, but that statistical significance is determined by whether the 95% confidence interval crosses the 0.5 midline. Highlighting this explicitly in both the figure and caption would prevent misinterpretation. Visually, increasing the size and contrast of the asterisks denoting significance—and using colorblind friendly alternatives—would enhance accessibility. The midline at 0.5 should be made more prominent to emphasize its role as a visual reference for enrichment or depletion in CRC. In Figure 5B, the rationale behind using cysteine desulfhydrase genes as markers for sulfide production should be more thoroughly explained in the caption or Discussion. A brief explanation of their role in hydrogen sulfide synthesis would provide essential context, especially since the paper hinges on microbial sulfide metabolism as a mechanism linking diet and disease. Terminological clarity is also needed: the phrase “presence/absence” should be replaced with “presence or absence” for proper usage, and minor grammatical errors (e.g., “cysteine desulfhydrase genes”) should be corrected. Consistency between panels A and B would also enhance the reader’s experience. This includes presenting the bacterial species in the same order along the y-axis, capitalizing figure labels (“Figure 5A” and “Figure 5B”), and starting the caption for each panel on a separate line. Shortening bacterial species names (e.g., using D. fastidiosa instead of Dilemma fastidiosa) could make the y-axis more readable without sacrificing clarity. Overall, these changes would not only improve the figure’s visual clarity but also support a more nuanced understanding of the results. Aligning terminology, improving visual accessibility, and strengthening the interpretive context particularly regarding the AUC metric and sulfide related gene markers would make Figure 5 more informative and persuasive within the broader narrative of dietary influence on gut microbiota and CRC risk. Lastly our group proposed several edits aimed at improving the clarity, consistency, and grammatical precision of the manuscript. Key terms such as “AUC” (pg. 16), “Lgr5hi ISCs” (pg. 5), and “IACUC” (pg. 6) should be defined upon first use to aid reader comprehension.

The study shows that by alternating electrostatic charge pair and cation-π interactions enables control over the symmetry, periodicity and morphology of assemblies and reveals how pH-dependent behavior affects structural transitions. Researchers employed CD, Cryo-EM, SEM, SAXS and coarse-grained MD simulations to validate these findings. This work offers a comprehensive understanding in sequence-structure correlation and hierarchical assembly behavior. The use of several advanced characterization methods and simulation to cross-validate morphological hypotheses adds strength to the conclusions. Major Points I think the Cryo-EM reconstruction that shows D-banding in FDY2 fibrils is one of the most exciting aspects of this work, especially the attempt to propose detailed stacking models like the 8+2 and 16+4 arrangements (Figure 4e–h). However, the resolution is around 8 Å, I believe it is important to be a bit cautious with how confidently these structural models are interpreted. At this resolution, the overall shape and periodicity are certainly visible but distinguishing the exact number or orientation of individual triple helices can be quite difficult. In my view, the proposed lateral packing models are valuable as hypotheses and help to guide future exploration, but they might be more appropriately described as possible interpretations rather than definitive conclusions. It could also help to clarify in the main text that higher-resolution methods or related techniques like SAXS-based modeling would be needed to confirm these specific arrangements. Minor Points: 1.	On page 18, the authors acknowledge that their coarse-grained model cannot capture nanotube or nanosheet formation, yet: They do not sufficiently discuss why their model fails to capture these. 2.	In “Introduction” part, “The synthesis of collagen-like molecules that recapitulate the hierarchical assembly of collagen also presents an opportunity to” this line is incomplete, I think. 3.	In figure 1, (panel b) where lateral and axial interactions are shown can be designed more carefully. 4.	In figure 3, (panel d & f), scale bar can be labeled on the image like panel e & g. 5.	On Small Angle X-ray Scattering section: “Raw data were processed were processed using Python 3.11.”  duplicate phrase “were processed” appears twice. 6.	CD melt derivative curves (Fig. S10) can be labeled with Tm values directly on graphs. Overall, I believe the manuscript is innovative and methodologically sound. The experimental claims are generally well supported though some discussion sections would benefit from more quantitative clarity and acknowledgment of limitations.

This resource offers unique reference data, analysis and visualization, and is availed as a new section, ‘Drugs and Agents in trial’ integrated in the GPCR database, GPCRdb. Furthermore, it includes a target selection tool for prioritization of receptors for future drug discovery. The major weakness of the paper is that the paper fails to include olfactory receptors in the database, the reliance on Open Targets disease association scores might miss novel hypotheses with weaker genetic backing. The validation of the newly introduced selection tools and visualizations, how the prioritization recommendations compare to existing approaches or human expert selection are unclear. This paper helps identify strategies and trends in current GPCR drug discovery and give insights into which already drugged, or yet untapped targets have the largest potential in specific diseases. Major Points 1. Validation of the Target Selection Tool The target selection tool offers a powerful yet swift means to prioritize GPCRs for future drug discovery based on disease indications, characterization, tissue expression and more. While there is no validation to show the tool’s performance. How does the tool perform when testing a now-successful GPCR target before it was clinically pursued? Consider revising by running the tool on historical data and show how it would have prioritized GIPR before the approval of tirzepatide. 2. Missing Method Comparison You described several new visualization methods (e.g., GPCRome wheel, intersecting Venns, Sankey plots) but how these tools are different from existing tools are not explained. Why are these tools better than existing tools such as those in Open Targets, ChEMBL, or DrugBank? consider adding a contextual comparison section to clarify the advantages and disadvantages of those tools, explain the innovations of the new visualization methods. 3. Disease Classification and Filtering The disease annotation relies on ICD-11 mapping from Open Targets (using EFO/HPO/MONDO). While manual curation of disease terms is not clearly defined. Adding a supplemental table listing these modifications would be great. 4.Exclusion of Olfactory Receptors Have Limitations Your research excludes olfactory receptors--a large family of GPCRs which play essential roles in cancer, reproduction, and metabolic regulation. Databas such as CORD (Comprehensive Olfactory Receptor Database) provides better annotations of olfactory receptors than those in GPCRdb, ligand binding and diseases linkage are also included. Including olfactory receptors in your research may reveal potential drug discovery opportunities. Minor Points Technical Questions 1.Definition of ""Agent"" vs. ""Drug"" should be explained in the Abstract or Introduction section. 2.Explain why do you choose 0.5 as the association score cutoff from Open Targets. 3. The classification rules of “pharmacological modality” of agonist, antagonist and allosteric modulatorare not clear. 4. Non-human GPCR targets (e.g., mouse models) are not included. Stylistic Issues 1.""the platform contains 516 drugs, 337 agents…"" is later repeated again in Figure 1 text. 2. “bioactivity data” and “bio-activity” are used inconsistently. 3. PDSP Ki database is used without prior expansion. Unable to Assess: Data integration are made from tools like Pharos, GTEx, and the Human Protein Atlas, especially for expression-based filtering. I cannot offer expert feedback on the transcriptomic expression atlas validation and the correctness of the tissue expression normalization procedures. Final Reflection This paper made great contributions to the GPCRs field by offering an online resource of GPCR drugs, clinical trial agents, targets and disease indications. The platform will help streamline drug development pipelines, helps identify strategies and trends in current GPCR drug discovery and give insights into which already drugged, or yet untapped targets have the largest potential in specific diseases.",2025-05-17T06:44:22,,11,10.1101/2025.01.11.632537,An online GPCR drug discovery resource,"Jimmy Caroli, Søren N.

The main goal was to analyze how these fibroblasts impact tumor development, with a specific emphasis on the mechanisms responsible for their noted tumor-suppressive effects. Strengths: This study offers an in-depth examination of the intricate interactions among stromal cells, the extracellular matrix, and the immune response within the tumor microenvironment. Its well-structured approach enhances our understanding of these complex relationships and their implications for cancer biology. 5.	The discovery of a particular subpopulation of bone marrow stromal cells (osterix+, CD31-, CD105-) and their essential contribution to the production of fibronectin in facilitating anti-tumor immunity through Ly6G+ cells is a significant and groundbreaking finding. 6.	The research utilizes a diverse set of advanced methods, such as various murine cancer models (including syngeneic and immune-deficient), transgenic mouse strains for conditional gene deletion (fibronectin and β1 integrin), cell sorting along with flow cytometry, proteomic assessment, and in vitro functional assays (migration, cytotoxicity, signaling). The incorporation of littermate controls and suitable statistical analyses enhances the reliability of the results 7.	The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor suppression, focusing on several critical components. Key receptors such as α5β1 integrin and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) are highlighted for their pivotal roles in mediating cellular responses to the tumor microenvironment. The study further elucidates the involvement of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating immune responses and inflammation as well as orchestrating the tumor suppression process. Additionally, the research identifies Ly6G+ neutrophils as important effector cells that contribute to the anti-tumor immune response, revealing their mechanisms of action and interaction with other cellular players in the tumor microenvironment. This comprehensive examination sheds light on the complex interplay between these molecular elements and their collective impact on inhibiting tumor growth. 8.	 The correlation that exists between low CD105/ENDOGLIN expression in melanoma tumors and improved patient survival offers a potential translational link for the findings, suggesting it could serve as a prognostic marker or therapeutic target. Weaknesses: While the study is robust, there are some areas that could be further clarified or expanded upon: 3.	The fragmented presentation of figures, such as ""Figure 1"" being separated from ""Figure 1 cont.,"" significantly disrupts the logical flow of information and complicates the interpretation of data for readers. 4.	The paper discusses the unexpected tumor-suppressive role of stromal cell-derived fibronectin, which contrasts with its usually pro-tumorigenic role. It notes that the CS1 fragment and TLR4 activation provide a mechanistic understanding, suggesting further exploration into why stromal-derived fibronectin behaves differently, such as the influence of specific isoforms and context-dependent signaling. Clarity : 3.	Supplement: Label tables more clearly (e.g., ""Proteomics Data"") 4.	Writing: Define abbreviations (e.g., ""pFN"") at first use. This manuscript by Lubosch et al. presents a significant and original body of work that enhances our understanding of how stromal cells can positively influence the anti-tumor immune response through fibronectin. The study is methodologically rigorous, the results are impactful, and the mechanistic insights are insightful. Although there are minor limitations and some areas where additional exploration could strengthen the conclusions, the fundamental findings are solid and well-supported. The recommendations for improvement aim to further increase the clarity, depth, and significance of this already strong contribution.

These condensates are membrane-less compartments created by protein and RNA molecules that form ‘dense’ and ‘dilute’ phases. The interface between these phases has been shown to promote the aggregation of the proteins that are part of the condensates and the formation of disease-associated fibrils of hnRPNA1. Previous literature has demonstrated preferential interfacial partitioning of a few proteins, but not of small molecules or peptides. This technique combines coarse-grained molecular simulations, mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), and machine learning. The authors use this workflow to design peptides that localize at the interface of biological condensates, hnRNPA1, LAX-1, and DDX4, which are formed by intrinsically disordered proteins. They test these designed peptides in vitro and show that they exhibit their intended surfactant-like activities using confocal microscopy. They also identify how the charge of these peptides is a crucial element of their physicochemical features. Overall, this study successfully shows that these short peptides preferentially distribute between the interface of the biomolecule condensate and the surrounding environment, showing surfactant-like properties. They also show that the net charge and the amino acid composition of these peptides in relation to their biomolecular condensate are crucial to determining whether they will preferentially partition at the interface. The authors have opened the potential to study more complex condensates using this rigorous strategy. This paper is exceptionally well written and thorough. I recommend this paper for publication with minor revisions. Major Point To experimentally validate this computational pipeline, you fluorescently label the selected peptides. This may show my lack of knowledge on this subject, but my one concern is regarding the potential effects of the fluorescent tag on the condensate system. This JBC paper from 2023 shows that fluorescently tagging a protein can promote phase separation , in this paper specifically huntingtin exon-1 with red fluorescent protein ( https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10825056/). So, what is to say that the Cy5- fluorophore isn’t playing a role in creating these surfactant-like properties of the designed peptide?

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.02.651903v1#comment-6706962826,biorxivstage,0,"In this study, the authors refine an established FDA method (FDA C010.02) originally developed for extracting PFAS from food to enable analysis of smaller volumes of Dolphin milk than previously possible, demonstrating that Dolphin milk may be a major source of PFAS for nursing calves. The major success of this paper was the ability to quantify the concentration for 13 targeted PFAS species and additional untargeted species in dolphin milk over a 2-year nursing period for the characterization of the PFAS most likely to be transferred from mother to calf. The major weakness of this study is the presence of several unsupported claims which undermine the rigor of the manuscript and weakens the credibility of the interpretations made. Nevertheless, this study provides important groundwork for future research on the transfer of accumulated PFAS from parent to offspring and the effect of PFAS on the development of aquatic newborns. Although the environmental accumulation of PFAS is well established, further research is needed to elucidate the horizontal transfer of these forever chemicals. Major Points 1. The manuscript states that dolphin milk was stored at the Smithsonian’s Mammal Milk Repository at -20C for the past 30 years, but provides no detail regarding the type of containers used or whether potential contamination from storage materials was assessed. Since PFAS are hard to avoid and known to leach from plastics, contamination from the storage material could significantly impact results, leading to the question: Were these samples stored in a plastic container that could have leeched PFAS into the milk? According to pictures from the Smithsonian website ( https://nationalzoo.si.edu/conservation/news/making-sense-animal-milks) the dolphin milk seems to be stored in plastic containers, however, the milk was harvested 30 years ago before the widespread knowledge of PFAS contamination. Were any blanks, storage container controls, or background correction measures collected to account for the PFAS introduced during storage? This study reports these chemicals in nanograms so even minimal leaching from storage materials could have introduced measurable contamination. 2. The methods sections states that the fish fed to the dolphin, Slooper, at the Naval Command Control and Ocean Surveillance Center were not screened for persistent organic pollutants (POPs). This raises a critical concern on whether the PFAS detected in the milk were primarily pre-existing maternal PFAS levels or diet-induced? Is there a chance that a species of fish had a higher amount of POPs within them than the others? At the same time, was there a regular feeding schedule that regularly spaced out the type of food? If Slooper was fed a more common/affordable food that happened to be more abundant in POPs at the beginning of the milking period, it could explain why there were so any PFAS detected initially and then tapered down later when she was fed other fish lower in POPs. Hence, the potential for dietary exposure to skew the results should be addressed in the discussion. Minor points 1. Citations are needed for the sentences listed below: -Line 43: “Since scientists have recently suggested that humanity has surpassed the planetary boundary for PFAS, major uncertainties must be addressed.” -Line 217: “Additionally, most studies have only performed targeted quantitative PFAS analyses and not looked for new and unknown PFAS.” -Line 283: “Previous studies have demonstrated that the lactational burden of POPs decreases following birth.” -Line 386: “Although research on neonatal PFAS exposure is expanding, many epidemiological studies examine only one compound, failing to capture the complexity of mixtures encountered in the environment.” -Line 467: “Although previous studies have linked traditional legacy PFAS, PFOS and PFOA, to adverse outcomes in dolphins and other marine mammals, there remains virtually no data on the impact of these chemicals or their replacement compounds on growth and development of neonatal marine mammals, especially with dosages of this magnitude.” None of these claims are backed up by any evidence, which only helps to erode the work done within this study. 2. Some scattered typos are listed below: -In line 110, the title of the section has the method name wrong. It is correctly stated in the section as FDA C10.02. -In line 201, Administration does not need “ ’s ”. -In line 313, there is a red underline in the space in “illustrated that”. 3. Weekly tolerable intake of PFAS from the European Food Safety Authority and Food Standards Australia New Zealand is specifically stated twice within this paper (lines 22 and 368), however, it is only revealed during the 2nd mention that this is the weekly tolerable intake of PFAS for humans. From the source it could be surmised that the data was for humans, but having those numbers used for dolphins implies an equivalence between humans and dolphins that is not properly justified or supported with data (line 462). If human values are used for reference purposes, this should be clearly labeled or explicitly stated. 4. The wording in the methods section about sample collection and handling is unclear. In the sentence starting on line 90, does “During this time” refer to during the process of being milked or during the 603-day period in which Slooper was milked or during her life at the Naval station? 5. This manuscript would benefit from references to recent studies on PFAS amounts in dolphin carcasses: Sciancalepore G et al. (2021) and Foord CS et al. (2024) to name a couple. From this paper alone, PFAS do not seem like a huge problem, but put into the context of the papers I listed, it paints a more concerning picture.",2025-05-17T03:17:17,urnewstepdaddy,UrNewStepDaddy,10.1101/2025.05.02.651903,Maternal PFAS Transfer through Lactation: Dolphin Milk Reveals Routes of Early-Life Exposure,"Kara M.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.21.639466v1#comment-6706875660,biorxivstage,0,"Summary: The major goal of this paper was to understand FAD binding to Cry4b isoform in vitro. This was done by in vitro binding assays, simulations of FAD binding to Cry4b and solvent accessibility, and mRNA transcription levels of in vivo and immunoprecipitation. The major success of this paper is establishing protocols for optimization and finding new methods to work with the Cry4b isoform. The major weaknesses stem from a lack of reliable experimental data. But this paper brings to attention the need for thorough and rigorous protocols. It also highlights how little is known about these proteins and sheds light on areas that need to be explored. Major Issues: Perhaps I am misunderstanding the conclusion of this paper, but it seems like the results of your experiments do not support your conclusion. In the introduction, it states that genome analysis of Cry4b exon has stop codons in the intrinsic region and asks if the mRNA is translated into function protein in vivo. How do we know that the samples collected didn’t have a nonfunctioning version of mRNA being translated? https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32978454/ This paper states that the Cry4b is expressed only at night, were the specimens harvested during the day vs night to compare Cry4 isoform expression? Could that be the reason for the discrepancy in the MS results? As stated in the paper: “...the latest avian genome analyses showed that the CRY4b-specific exon carries loss-of-function mutations (e.g., stop codons), a pattern characteristic for intronic regions  [29]This poses the question whether the ErCRY4b mRNA isoform is translated into a functional protein product in vivo.” Is this a factor that impacts the results of the experiments done? Considering that the major goal of this paper is to understand FAD binding in vitro, why weren’t those experiments thought out more carefully? It seems as if the inclusion of the vivo studies as well as the simulations were done in an attempt to reinforce the weak results of the experimental data. But the experimental data is hard to draw concrete conclusions from. In the paper, it states that the Cry4b might be misfolded, is there an experiment that verifies the fold of the protein? That is an important thing to consider, especially because these experiments are the basis of the paper. Does the solubility tag block FAD binding? What about the chaperone?

TWIK-2 is a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family and has been shown to play an important role in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammatory disease. In this work, the authors resolved the structure of TWIK-2 at 2.85 Å and of TWIK-2 bound to the FDA-approved antipsychotic drug, pimozide, at 3.17 Å and described the features of these structures. While they observed that TWIK-2 shares core structural features with other K2P channels, such as the presence of lateral fenestrations which house acyl chains, this work also highlighted several distinctive characteristics: A unique positioning of Tyr111: Tyr111 is found in the sixth position of the selectivity filter 1 (SF1) sequence—only one other K2P channel shares this feature. In the TWIK-2 structure, Tyr111 adopts an ""up"" conformation, which the authors speculate might be a binding site for channel modulators. Identification of a novel SF1-P1 pocket: A previously uncharacterized pocket behind the selectivity filter was discovered, potentially contributing to channel gating or modulation. After purifying the TWIK-2 protein, the authors used a liposome-based flux assay to demonstrate that purified TWIK-2 was functionally active, similar to TWIK-2 found in its native environment. This assay showed that TWIK-2 mediates K⁺-K-selective currents and can be inhibited by known blockers (Ba²⁺, ML365) and pimozide, which exhibited higher apparent potency. After testing the bioactivity, the cryo-EM structure of the pimozide-bound channel revealed that the drug binds within the central cavity below the selectivity filter and displaces acyl chains, which led them to conclude that it likely blocks ion conduction. The binding pocket overlaps with sites used by other K⁺ channel inhibitors and is accessible via the membrane, suggesting that other hydrophobic molecules could serve as viable TWIK-2 inhibitors. In summary, the study provides the first high-resolution structural and functional characterization of TWIK-2, offering key insights into its gating, conductance, and targetability. These findings lay a foundation for developing selective TWIK-2 inhibitors as potential therapeutics for inflammatory diseases involving the NLRP3 inflammasome. Major Successes: The researchers were able to determine high–quality cryo-EM structures of previously undetermined apo (2.85 Å) and inhibitor-bound (3.17Å) TWIK-2 structures. They obtained well-resolved features that enabled highly confident modeling of transmembrane and pore regions. Provided Reports of novel structural features: Identification of unique 'up' conformation of Try111 in the selectivity filter in the TWIK-2 structure.

Provided insight into the mechanism of inhibition: Successfully demonstrated the inhibition of TWIK-2 by pimozide, an FDA-approved drug. Provided evidence to show that pimozide occupies the central cavity below the selectivity filter and displaces the acyl chain. The work demonstrates therapeutic relevance. TWIK-2 has a strong linkage to NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which makes it a potential target for the druggable anti-inflammatory targets. Major Shortcomings: It might be beyond the scope of the study, but there is no mutational or dynamic data to confirm Try111's role in inactivation gating or binding with channel modulators. Minor Technical questions. Was Tyr111 mutagenesis attempted to assess its influence on gating or conductance? How reproducible is the liposome assay? What were the number of technical vs biological replicates? Was negative-stain EM used during sample quality control?

Bortezomib and Actinomycin D are the two chemotherapeutics that are used throughout the paper to look at the cytotoxic protection that these stem cells and progenitor cells employ. For figure 1e, they performed an experiment to certify that Bortezomib does not reach its target in the stem cells. These experiments were also done for other chemotherapeutics but not for Actinomycin D. Could there be an additional similar experiment to demonstrate that Actinomycin D also does not reach its target in the stem cells? This would be to fully certify that this statement applies to all the drugs used in the study. More elaboration on the techniques and experiments corresponding to each figure would be helpful to allow the audience to better understand the figure itself. On the figure description itself, there is very little mentioned on the techniques used. Overall, by not having a materials and method section in the article, it is even harder for the reader to understand how these experiments were done. Presenting more quantitative data alongside the qualitative data presented would be great to validate the importance of the findings. For example, figure 1 lacks a quantitative representation of the visual data, which would make it simpler for the audience to digest by being able to align a number to what is observed. Is there an equal contribution from stem cells and progenitor cells or are there differences between the two? This topic is lightly discussed in the results/discussion, but it would be significant to distinguish between the two which one has more impact in these findings. Minor technical issues: In page 7 for the first paragraph, it refers to a 2-fold increase in stem/progenitor dye retention found in Figure 2e, but that figure only has parts A-C. This might be a typo but could be a quick fix. When it comes to the structure of the article, it was difficult to follow the different sections of the paper. I was not able to access the materials and methods part of the paper to further read on the way these experiments were done. Separating the results and discussion of the article would definitely help with the digestion of the information. It might just be a problem with BioRxiv itself but adding the materials and methods at the end of the article would be very helpful. Would it also be possible to show us how to access the supplementary information as well. Keeping the same nomenclature throughout for the genes and proteins would significantly help with the clarity of the paper. Overall, the manuscript is a major contribution to stem cell and cancer research by identifying possible factors that directly interfere with the efficacy of chemotherapeutics. I would recommend this paper for publication after addressing the major revisions mentioned before. Very few extra experiments would be needed for these revisions and would mostly rely on the elaboration of techniques.

Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, the study compares the amidated (U3.5-NH2) and non-amidated (U3.5-OH) forms of the peptide in both monomeric and tetrameric (amyloid-like) states interacting with a model bacterial membrane made of POPE:DOPG lipids. One of the key strengths of the study is its clear demonstration of how a single post-translational modification can affect peptide behavior. The simulations show that amidation improves peptide-membrane binding, promotes α-helical structure formation, and supports a “carpet-like” mechanism of antimicrobial activity. The paper also suggests that the amyloid form may act as a reservoir, gradually releasing active monomers at the membrane surface. However, the study has some limitations. The conclusions are only based on computational work without experimental data to support the findings. Additionally, providing a clearer explanation for the selection of the tetrameric structure would improve the clarity and reproducibility of the work. Overall, the paper provides useful insights into the structural role of amidation and its impact on antimicrobial function. I think it contributes to the broader understanding of AMP design and peptide-membrane interactions. Major Comments: 1.	The study is entirely based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations without any experimental validation. While the results are interesting, it is difficult to fully trust the conclusions without supporting experimental data. 2.	The paper does not explain why the specific tetrameric structure was used. It was taken from a cryo-EM study, but it is not clear why these four specific peptides were selected or how well they represent amyloid structures. Explanation in the methods or results would improve clarity and help readers understand the biological relevance of the setup. Minor Comments: 1.	The paper does not mention which method was used to calculate the secondary structure (like α-helix and 310-helix). Since this is important for interpreting related results, it would help to state which tool or algorithm was used. 2.	In Figure S5, the RDF plots show how close the peptide is to the lipid, but the paper does not specify what distance counts as a real interaction. Adding a sentence to explain this cutoff would help readers understand the strength of the peptide-lipid binding. 3.	There is a typo in the caption of Figure S7: “three of the four peptides where in an α-helical conformation” should be corrected to “were” instead of “where”.

These evolutionary transitions are not spared of the biomolecular constructs that make up this life, which include proteins and DNA. These big and subtle changes which have been identified through various evolutionary studies, have led to recent understanding as to why various biomolecules behave the way they do while still maintaining their functionality across varying ancestors. In this work, the authors set out to examine how the Lacl/GaIR family (LGF) of transcription factors (TFs) exhibits entropy-enthalpy trade-offs. The study focuses on 4 ancestors (Anc1-4) which likely emerged after a fusion of solute-binding proteins with DNA-binding domains and the extant E.coli Lacl proteins. The authors utilized methods like ancestral sequence reconstruction to characterize the structural variations of the LGF TFs. The sets the stage for mapping the thermodynamic variability across the Lacl/GaIR family, and how the entropy-entropy trade-offs are achieved. To address this, the study introduces parameters like binding affinity and melting temperatures to characterize the evolutionary transition from Ancestor 1 through 4 and the extant E. coli Lacl. The major success of this paper is characterizing the free energy of binding into the enthalpic (delta H) and entropic (-TdeltaS) contributions. This laid a foundation that helped in understanding their primary aim, which is the entropy-enthalpy trade-offs that biomolecules have had to undergo in order to maintain their relevance. The authors demonstrated structural insight into binding specificity of d-Fructose to ancestor 1, which has a more open binding site for its ligand, and the specificity of ancestor 4 and extant Lacl, which has a more closed binding site with beta methyl D-galactosides (BMDG) as its preferred ligand. This work establishes a framework for understanding why biomolecules with the same ancestral line possess mutational changes both in residue sequence and conformational characteristics. The authors attributed these changes to the environmental temperature changes over geological time and general environmental changes that biomolecules adapt to in order to retain their evolutionary functions. Major Points: The limited effect of thermodynamics: While I might not have a clear understanding of evolutionary changes, especially with respect to this study, I think that thermodynamics might not be the only major factor. Although one of the main aims is situated around the entropy-enthalpy trade-offs as classified using the properties that constitute the free energy of binding calculations. I suggest that thermodynamics might not be contributing solely to this characteristic observed The effects of kinetics, which are not addressed, might have some contribution, probably of equal magnitude with thermodynamics contributions Limited evolutionary trajectory: Since the family is said to have existed for approximately 3 billion years, analyzing thermodynamic properties of just 4 ancestors and an extant Lacl might be speculative rather than factual about the whole family Minor point: Overall, the paper was well written, but one misspelling that caught my attention is the paragraph on page 14 below Figure 5 caption, in the last sentence. “It should be noted that he apo and d-fucose....” where ‘he’ should be ‘the’ The SEM bar on Figure 2 (a) appears to be slightly invisible, I suggest changing it to a darker color, or an overall bar graph color that is well-contrast with the error bars.

The authors introduce four metrics (M1–M4) based on free energy calculations using a NUPACK-based model: M1 captures staple-scaffold misbinding, M2 scaffold self-binding, M3 staple-staple co-folds, and M4 staple internal structures. These were used to score and filter candidate scaffolds for a triangle and rectangle origami design, sampled from de Bruijn, biological, and synthetic sequence pools. Key findings include the identification of scaffold variants with reduced off-target binding that folded more reliably, as validated by AFM and optical tweezers. Variants T1 (de Bruijn) and T2 (Pareto-ranked biological) showed higher yield and structural uniformity, while T3 (reverse-front biological) frequently misfolded or aggregated. The authors suggest that sequence-dependent kinetic traps are a key factor in these outcomes. The method’s strength lies in isolating sequence as an independent variable, showing that even when the overall design and staple routing remain constant, modifying the scaffold sequence alone can have a significant impact on folding behavior and yield. The dual-lab blind testing protocol further strengthens the validity of their conclusions. Overall, this paper contributes a practical and scalable method for improving DNA origami reliability at the sequence level, and sets a precedent for sequence-aware design tools in the field. Major Issues -	Interpretation of structural disorder in NUM clustering (Figure 6) requires clarification. The use of hierarchical clustering to assess force-extension profiles is appropriate, but the thresholds for cluster assignment are not discussed. To support the interpretation that T3 exhibits high disorder, it would be helpful to clarify how clustering thresholds were selected and whether alternative settings affect the assignment. Otherwise, the interpretation may overstate differences that are method-dependent. -	Unclear relationship between individual metrics and folding success. Since the paper uses a multi-metric ranking scheme, a brief textual reflection on whether any single metric (M1–M4) appeared more predictive than others would help strengthen interpretation and validate the ranking approach. -	Quantitative folding yields not consistently mapped to metrics. While AFM results suggest strong differences in folding success among variants, the M1–M4 scores for each scaffold are not explicitly tied to observed outcomes. A summary paragraph or table linking these values in the main text would help reinforce the link between off-target minimization and folding performance. -	In Figure 4, the authors present AFM images and gel results comparing the triangle variants T1, T2, and T- While the visual differences are compelling, the description in the main text could more clearly connect specific off-target metrics such as a high M2 score in T3 with the observed aggregation. Similarly, the quantification of ""well-folded,"" ""semi-folded,"" and ""misfolded"" structures is valuable, but the criteria for classification are not clearly defined in the figure legend or main discussion. A short paragraph clarifying how structures were binned into categories, and whether this was done blindly, would strengthen the interpretation of this key figure. -	Equal weighting of thermodynamic metrics lacks justification. The authors use equal weights for the four thermodynamic metrics (M1–M4) in ranking scaffold sequences, but don’t explain why these should contribute equally. Since scaffold-scaffold binding (M2) might have a larger influence due to its intramolecular nature, this assumption could bias ranking. I recommend either providing a rationale for equal weighting, performing a sensitivity check, or softening claims that treat the metrics as equally impactful. -	Claim about aggregation lacks direct support. The interpretation that aggregation in high off-target sequences (T3 and R3) is caused by scaffold-scaffold interactions seems plausible, but no direct evidence is shown. To improve clarity, the authors could mention that while the aggregation is consistent with such interactions, alternative causes such as staple misfolding or variations due to concentration aren’t ruled out. Rephrasing this point or adding supporting gel data could improve the argument. -	Interpretation of aggregation in poorly folding structures is speculative. The authors report aggregation in samples with high off-target scores, suggesting scaffold-scaffold interactions as the likely cause. However, no direct evidence is provided to support this interpretation. Alternatively, the authors could strengthen the interpretation by referencing any existing gel patterns or noting whether aggregation varied with concentration during folding trials or revising the interpretation to make clear that the aggregation is consistent with, but not direct proof of, scaffold-scaffold binding. -	Limited diversity of tested origami shapes. The validation is limited to a triangle and rectangle—both 2D shapes with relatively simple geometries. Since many applications depend on 3D or more densely routed structures, it would be helpful to include a brief discussion on how this method is expected to generalize, or acknowledge its current limitations in scope. -	Folding outcome analysis lacks dynamic insight. The authors mainly use end-point assessment (AFM, gel) and unfolding profiles (OT) to evaluate folding. However, different scaffold sequences may lead to different folding pathways, which aren’t explored here. While additional kinetic experiments are not needed, it would strengthen the paper to mention that folding dynamics could be sequence-sensitive and suggest this as a potential future direction. Minor Issues Minor technical questions and clarification points: -	GC content relevance should be clarified. While GC content is widely understood in the field, it would be helpful to explain why it is relevant at the point of first mention. For example, does higher GC content promote more stable on-target binding, or does it also increase risk for strong off-target duplexes? Clarifying this would help readers unfamiliar with its tradeoffs in origami design. -	Supplementary findings deserve mention in the main text. Several results, such as the comparison between biological and synthetic sequences, and the minimal effect of scaffold rotation, are relegated to the supplementary notes. Summarizing these briefly in the main results would help reinforce the conclusions. -	Ambiguity in outcome terminology. Phrases like “largely failed” to fold (used for T3 and R3) should be supported by specific quantitative results such as the proportion of well-formed structures visible in AFM or the frequency of trace groupings in OT clustering to clarify what degree of misfolding is being referenced. -	Timing of de Bruijn explanation. The paper introduces de Bruijn sequences early but delays explanation of why they were selected. Briefly noting their core property—uniform distribution of k-mers and minimal short repeats—in the introduction would help orient readers unfamiliar with their significance. Stylistic and clarity-related issues: Figure legends could include more interpretation. Some figure legends (notably Figures 4 and 5) mostly restate what was done rather than what is seen. Including brief interpretations (e.g., which variant performed best) would improve their usefulness. Recommendation Accept with minor revisions This study presents a solid combination of computational design and experimental validation. It offers a practical way to improve DNA origami folding by taking sequence effects into account. A few areas could be explained or expanded better, but overall the work is strong and would be a good contribution to the field.",2025-05-15T08:29:21,,Jvas,10.1101/2025.01.29.635450,Optimizing DNA origami assembly through selection of scaffold sequences that minimise off-target interactions,"Ben Shirt-Ediss, Emanuela Torelli, Silvia Adriana Navarro, Hadeel Khamis, Ariel Kaplan, William Trewby, Juan Elezgaray, Nima Moradzadeh-Esmaeili, Michael Haydell, Daniel Keppner, Michael Famulok, Natalio Krasnogor",2025-01-30

The researchers developed a 96-well colorimetric fluoride assay to screen culturable bacteria in the human body and identified dehalogenases (an enzyme that degrades environmental pollutants) in gut bacteria, including Clostridia, Bacilli, and Coriobacteriia, that hydrolyze fluorinated amino acids. This enabled the researchers to identify key amino acids important for defluorination. Then, the researchers successfully converted dechlorinating dehalogenases into defluorinating dehalogenases by substituting the carboxyl (C)-terminal 41 amino acids with those from naturally occurring defluorinating dehalogenases. Whole protein alanine scanning, molecular dynamics simulations, and chimeric protein design facilitated the identification of the role of the C-terminal region of dehalogenases in defluorination. The researchers also trained machine learning models to understand the structural and sequence differences between defluorinating and non-defluorinating dehalogenases. These novel predictive models were trained on the 41 amino acid segments of the C-termini and predicted defluorination activity with 83% accuracy and 95% accuracy when based on the full-length protein features. This study ultimately discovered that the human gut microbial enzymes are capable of cleaving C-F bonds. The figures in this paper are clear and well-organized, which lent themselves to effectively conveying complex data. The methods section of this paper goes into great detail, describing the different types of equipment used, explaining multiple validation steps, and noting where protocols were modified from the original workflow. The researchers provide GitHub links for their data, which shows that their methods are easily reproducible. They also have several replicates for their experiments and test why certain aspects of their experiments did not work. They also succeeded in developing a novel assay for alanine screening. This study is significant and relevant because of the prevalence of fluorinated drugs and environmental pollutants such as Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), commonly referred to as “forever chemicals,” in our environment. This study uncovers the ability of the human gut microbiome to metabolize fluorinated compounds and gives insight into developing engineered enzymes to mitigate the effects of fluorinated pollutants and drugs in the human body. Their novel predictive model could help in the development of interventions to address environmental and human health concerns associated with fluorinated substances. Major points: There are a few major aspects of this paper that could be improved: 1. I think this paper could benefit from an explanation or discussion of where they speculate the fluoride ions migrate to in the human body after cleavage of the C-F bonds. This may provide more transparency between the author and the reader about what is happening in the human body, especially since this paper addresses human health concerns and environmental pollutants. 2. Also, in order to strengthen the results and increase the reproducibility of the work, I recommend a more detailed description of the statistical analysis employed by the researchers. 3. I do appreciate the acknowledgement of the limitations of the study by the authors: o The range of fluorinated compounds is limited to overexpressed recombinant dehalogenases sourced from the gut microbiota o The comparison of in vivo and pure culture experiments is lacking 4. I acknowledge that it is beyond the scope of this study, but for possible follow-up experiments, the researchers could expand the range of fluorinated compounds by testing more substrates and could conduct more experiments in vivo. Minor points: There are a few minor aspects of this paper that could be improved: 1. In the editing stage of this publication, it would help the reader for the authors to standardize the terminology they used. Also, there were instances where the authors used scientific jargon when introducing the study. For example, it would be helpful if the authors explained or wrote out what “LB” referred to in their methods. This would strengthen the author’s ability to communicate science to a general audience. 2. I recognize English may not be the authors’ first language, however, to increase the clarity of the presentation of this work, I suggest editing the minor typos in the second to last paragraph of the Introduction section: “Here,e” and “which us motivated…” 3. Throughout the paper, the authors switch tenses, going from past tense to present tense and then back to past tense again. There are also some grammatical errors that need to be addressed in order to improve the sentence structure. This would help with the overall flow of the paper. 4. Lastly, the figures could have color palettes that are more accessible for people who are colorblind. In conclusion, I would recommend this paper for publication with minor revisions. I did not find any fundamental issues with this paper that would disqualify it from publication. I acknowledge that I do not have the expertise in biochemistry to comment on the exact experimental methods utilized, however, I do not think there was experimental misconduct or unfounded claims made about the data. This work involves a novel experimental design, and this study was well thought out and executed. I think this work would be very impactful to the scientific community and human society.",2025-05-14T22:16:23,,Anonymous ,10.1101/2024.07.15.601322,Enzymatic carbon-fluorine bond cleavage by human gut microbes,"Silke I.

Their idea for testing KGM is based on the findings from Chen et al. 2019 where they tested glucomannan on type 2 diabetes in rats. The added benefit with this paper is the addition of exercise with KGM. The groups that they used were high-fat diet (HFD), normal control group (CON), aerobic exercise group (HAE), KMG group (HKM), and combined treatment (HKE). I believe that the authors were successful in establishing that KGM and exercise likely reduce body weight, improve lipid metabolism and oxidative status in obese rats. They validated their findings through their rigorous testing of liver lipids, liver enzymes, lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and antioxidants. Their statistical analyses are good and are held to a low p-value with high significance. The authors included a figure for the underlying mechanisms of konjac and exercise on lipid metabolism, which makes it easy to understand. Overall, the study adds in the benefits of both konjac and exercise. This study also repeats how konjac and exercise can separately improve obesity as well as together. Previous literature has established that konjac and exercise improve obesity through multiple mechanisms, as mentioned in your introduction. While the authors' findings are not particularly surprising, they have provided rigorous and sufficient data to support their hypothesis. The overall impact of the paper is modest. Major Points The figure captions could be more descriptive. For example, figure 5 would benefit from a more detailed explanation of the role and relevance of each antioxidant and a clear indication of which groups showed the most favorable results in the figure caption. I am unsure if this statement, “Exercise is reported to enhance the ability of skeletal muscles to utilise lipids as opposed to glycogen, thus reducing lipid levels.” is completely true. It appears to be an oversimplification of the findings from Mann et al. (2014). Current literature suggests that utilization depends on exercise intensity and other factors. Clarifying that the statement applies to low-intensity steady-state cardio would improve its accuracy. Please let me know if you think otherwise. Minor Points If you could please write out the groups in the abstract or introduction that would be helpful for me to understand what the groups are from the beginning. Figure 2 may be more interpretable as a bar graph, which could better illustrate group differences. It would help me see the differences easily. I am confused about Figure 4. Please clarify the labeling—specifically, whether Figure 4A represents a control or a healthy adipose tissue sample. This will help me understand it easily. Ensure all figure panels are clearly labeled and legible. Enlarging Figure 4 slightly might improve readability as well as getting a better resolution for figure 3. Recommendation I recommend publishing this paper with intermediate/minor revisions. Here are the key revisions required: More comprehensive figure captions Clarification in the introduction regarding lipid vs. glycogen utilization during exercise. Improved labeling for Figure 4. Optional suggestions: Reformatting Figure 2 as a bar graph for clarity. Slight enlargement of figures to improve visual accessibility. Write out full group names at the beginning of the preprint for easier readability",2025-05-13T22:37:57,,Chris C.,10.1101/2025.03.26.645401,Effects of Exercise and Konjac on Lipid Metabolism and Mechanism in Obese Rats,"Ling Ruan, Zhengqing Lv, Guanghua Wang, Shoubang Li, Kun You, Menglin Chen, Siyuan Liu, Lu Pu, Xinyue Liu, Yun Pang, Siyu Liu",2025-03-28

This circuit supports and shows mechanism for your experimental findings. I would be curious and grateful for your opinion. Cannabinoids were found to disinhibit the medial habenula MHb (from its gabaergic MS/DBB input). I propose that by disinhibiting the MHb-IPN circuit the cannabinoids induce cortical and subcortical SWA, and sedation. The IPN interacts with hDBB, dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex, and likely inhibits the NI, LDT, and LHb. IPN activates MRN. Your important studies proved that MRN inhibits MS/vDBB and theta oscillations.

More specifically - in our paper we specifically pointed out, that a combination of high exogenous PAC1-R levels (in a commercial cell overexpressing the receptor) as well as the use of IBMX in cAMP accumulation assays didn‘t result in any tractable matter in a first screen for SMOL antagonists. We finally succeeded when going for HEK‘s endogenously expressing the receptor and ommitting IBMX -  the best explanation for this strategy to us being a clear hint towards a high (cAMP) coupling efficiency of the agonist stimulated receptor that may mask any inhibitory pharmacological read-out by SMOL inhibitors in comparison to peptides antagonists. Thus I wonder wether running the very same assays you performed in the absence of IBMX would be more likely to prove BAY268.. activity. I can also imagine that transiently transfecting your reporter construct (only) into native HEK‘s may also confirm BAY268.. activity  - once the presence of the endogenous receptor has been demonstrated, of course. Achieving  appropriate (assay) conditions to demonstrate receptor inhibition by SMOL modulators has been a major issue not only for us but also for an other pharma research group studying VIP antagonism (see reference in our paper).

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.25.650714v1#comment-6702404410,biorxivstage,1,"The manuscript by Stanhope et al. investigates the role of the one-carbon metabolism enzyme S-Adenosylhomocysteinase (Ahcy) in the alteration of neurodegeneration gene expression in Drosophila. The authors found that oxidation of C195 of Ahcy inhibits its activity, leading to neuroprotective changes in gene expression through an unknown mechanism. The findings highlight the importance of C195 oxidation in Ahcy, potentially limiting enzyme activity in a metabolism-dependent manner. We agree with the authors’ conclusions and we provide major and minor comments below to assist in the clarity and ease of interpretation of the manuscript. Major comments - Please provide more information on Ahcy and AhcyL1, e.g. how many cysteines does Ahcy contain? Does AhcyL1 respond to blue light stress? - Line 55, please include a brief explanation of the redox proteomics approach and whether it was concluded that C195 is involved in a disulfide bond. We suggest discussing early on from structural prediction of Ahcy whether the two cysteines (C195 and presumably C228) are in close proximity for a disulfide bond to form as otherwise it is unclear what is meant by oxidation of C195 (it could be e.g. a sulfenic acid) and what the ‘second’ cysteine is. - Fig1E, include samples with reductant and oxidant +/- labeling to show where the fully reduced or oxidized protein migrates. There appears to be a slight band present in the “second labeled cys” in the C195S, which would contradict the statement in Line 99. Could you comment on it. Although not required for the conclusions, including protein samples from flies that are blue light-treated would inform on whether Ahcy-C195 becomes oxidized. - We found it quite striking that the RNAi lines for AhcyL1 were also displaying a low level of Ahcy. Could it be an issue of sequence identity between Ahcy and AhcyL1 leading to off-target effects? Or could AhcyL1 positively regulate Ahcy gene expression? Also, could you explain the modest changes in the expression of AhcyL1 in the AhcyL1 line? - Fig2D, E, how do you explain the variation in AhcyL1 and Gnmt between the three Ahcy RNAi lines? Consider revising line 126-127: “without any corresponding changes in AhcyL1” as there are changes. - Line 255, it would be of interest to provide more discussion of the discrepancy between this work and the previous work which showed Ahcy-dependent enhancement of H3K4me3. Line 273, consider revising this sentence as it was not shown here that Ahcy promotes methylation, which data indicate this point? Minor comments - Figures, figure panels are mostly small, with large white space between them. Increasing panel size and image fidelity would help to fully visualize data (e.g. Fig. 2A, 4E). Figure 1E, increasing the size and brightness/contrast would be good too. - Line 43, consider revising 'higher' to another term (e.g. multicellular organisms) because 'higher’ assumes that complexity increased with the evolution of eukaryotes, which is not always the case. - Line 70, briefly describe S2 cells and why they are being used here. - Line 77, define TMT. - Lines 81-84, repeated information from introduction that could be removed or condensed. - Fig1A, we found it unusual to include previously published data, is that because it wasn’t displayed as a graph in the previous study? - Fig1B, add arrowheads and acronyms by the molecules (SAM, SAH) and an arrow indicating inhibition of methyltransferases. - Fig 1E, define “IGMR”. - Line 108, cite also Fig1C. - Line 113, refer to Fig2A instead of Fig1A. - Line 115, add Fig2A for the Ahcy interaction with itself. - Line 140, refer to Supp Fig2B instead of 2A. Could you describe the data presented in Supp Fig2B in the legend. - Lines 146-147, refer to Fig 3A only instead of 3A & 3B, as you are describing catalytic efficiency (kcat/km). - Line 158, could you discuss further how else C. elegans Ahcy differs from Drosophila? Maybe provide an alignment of the full protein sequences in supplemental. Are there other key differences between Drosophila and C. elegans Ahcy in structure or function? The rate shown in Fig. 3B appears different at lower SAH rates specifically, is this relevant? - Line 170, refer to Supp Fig2A instead of 2B. Figure 3E, add adenosine label. Could adenosine come from cleavage of NAD+ in these conditions? Or is the product of SAH hydrolysis (adenosine) still complexed with the enzyme Ahcy upon purification? - Line 180, refer to Fig3A instead of 3B. - Line 181, consider including the structure of the C195S mutant (does it accumulate to wild type level or does the mutation destabilize the protein?) - Lines 191-192, do you have other evidence than structural ones that suggests that C195 is completely protected from solvent (i.e., H2O2) when NAD+ is bound? - Line 207, add the word cells after ""photoreceptor"" - Figure 2, could you include in the legend what is meant by 3% input? In “(A) Ahcy, AhcyL1, and AhcyL1 in S2 cells” should read Ahcy, AhcyL1, and AhcyL2 in S2 cells. - Fig2A, there’s a lower band for AhcyL1-V5 in the input, is that a N-term truncation product (if V5 is in C-term)? - Fig 2C-E, the style of displaying the statistics on these graphs are initially a bit misleading as the straight lines across multiple bars seem to indicate significance across all the bars under the line, but on further inspection it might be representing a statistical comparison between the bars at the end of each line. It might be helpful to use bracketed lines instead of straight lines that point directly to the bars been compared. - Fig2C-F, the RNAi lines used in these panels are referenced in the Supplementary Table 1, but this table is missing. - Line 250, when discussing redox sensing, and the lack of Set1 oxidation in your previous analysis, clarify whether only cysteines were analyzed. It could be that methionine for example are oxidized in their sulfoxide form and possess a regulatory role. - Lines 263-265, maybe rephrase “when compared both with untreated Ahcy RNAi flies and with mCherry RNAi flies exposed to blue light” to “when compared with mCherry RNAi flies exposed to blue light” because the untreated Ahcy RNAi flies had lower levels than the treated ones, and the original wording suggests that the treated is lower than the untreated. - Lines 296-297, missing space between using and anti. - Line 332, include the specific type of qPCR kit used. - Figure 4B, could you explain in the legend what the dashed arrows represent or are showing? - Figure 4E, could you orient the non-initiated reader as to how these data are compared, how can one tell the differences observed e.g. between Ahcy RNAi blue light vs. control blue light is not significant?

Your research is quite novel and brings interesting implications for the further development use of RNA biotech in aquaculture. Summary Summary: This paper demonstrated a novel approach of feeding fish E.coli engineered to express double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a vector. The authors demonstrated that non-invasive dsRNA delivery via feeding technique can knock down the dnd gene during PGCs migration and differentiation in S. schlegelii. The authors demonstrated that transformed E.coli vectors can be combined with rotifers, brine shrimp and dry feed to serve as an effective means of introducing dsRNA. Introduction A comprehensive review and introduction on the topic was given. Objective was clearly stated and achieved. Materials & Methods Methods are straightforward and easy to follow. Someone who is not necessarily an expert in aquaculture or RNAi technology would be able to understand how this experiment was conducted. Methods are put in succinct and desirable detail. The inclusion of a figure to represent the construct generated did enhance the section but would have benefited from a caption rather than representation at the end of the paper. Including supplementary material on primers specific sequence would also be good to add for improved reproducability. Results The results of this experiment were very interesting. An approximated 50% of fish displayed dysplasia in their gonads. Insinuating that a large number of these fish would be infertile. Taking off target effects into account would have been useful, but did not seem to be tested for in this experiment. I viewed your paper on biorxiv, so this may have contributed to formatting issues, but I found it difficult to interpret some figures because they were displayed at the end of the article without an explanatory paragraph. This made full interpretation difficult and required heavier interpretation by the reader. You explain your results in the discussion which allows an attentive reader to understand the results. Discussion The significance and relevance of your results are clearly explained. The value not only in scientific but also commercial realms is illuminated to draw maximum There is some conjecture that the gonads in the fish are ideal candidates for germ cell transplantation. However it is not clear that these gonads would be functional, especially considering the dysplasia and sex reversal observed in many individuals. In lines 462 through 463, describing these fish as ideal recipients for PGCs is dubious due to seemingly described gonad dysfunction and deformity. Further exploration on how gonads could be made useable would help to backup this view. Figures Some issues in viewing the figures may be due to the nature of how I viewed the document, however the imaging of gonads would have benefitted from additional explanation. Comparison between normal and altered gonads would have made the significance of these images more understandable. Tables (a) & (b) lacked a nearby description which made interpretation difficult. A way to demonstrate recorded effects over sampling time in a table or graph would have been favorable as well. Also including a figure categorizing gonad manifestation would have been useful. References They are well arranged, easy to understand and suitable for this paper. Overall Review This paper presented very novel techniques and had fascinating results. Someone with adequate technical skill could replicate this experiment. I wonder if this can be applied to the more efficient creation of transgenic organisms, vaccine delivery and other benefits. I look forward to reading about more applications of this research.
