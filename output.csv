The 80% figure refers to the mortality rate that is produced by the chimeric virus infection of a strain of laboratory mice that was specifically engineered to be more susceptible than mice naturally are to this disease. This is where a lot of the misleading claims/misinformation/misrepresentation comes from. Please also do keep in mind that the chimeric virus had a lower mortality rate than the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain, which is currently classified in a risk group that permits it to be appropriately handled in a BSL-3 facility. In addition, Biosafety/Biosecurity isn't based on what you hope. Pathogen aren't classified according to Biosafety Level, labs/facilities are. Pathogens are classified in risk groups (RG).

I look forward to reading more of your work. That being said, if I'm reading this correctly, there seems to be a mistake in line 136 ""Bat RVJ-like rotavirus BtSY1 (BtRV1, present in Hi. larvatus and Rh.macrotis)"", as I find weird that the authors call BtSY1 a rotavirus, because it's later revealed that BtSY1 is actually a Coronavirus of the genus Sarbecovirus in line 156-157 [""both Bat 156 SARS-like virus BtSY1 and BtSY2 belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus of betacoronaviruses 157 and are closely related to human SARS-CoV (>90% nucleotide identity)""]. I'm assuming the authors meant to write ""BtRV1"" instead of ""BtSY1"", unless I'm somehow reading it wrong.

This paper focuses on targeted KIR sequencing, and T1K is for common RNA-seq, WES, WGS. There could be some assumption difference, such as that the targeted sequencing data usually has super high coverage. We recently managed to run PING successfully on its test data, which was also targeted sequencing data. T1K was quite consistent with PING on that data. But on WGS data, PING still fails, which I think is because some models might not work on the lower coverage cases.

I shall add mason version in the manuscript. Mason1 seems have a better profile for Illumina reads. I used random pair to maximize the diversity in the test. For example, if we use realistic test, many of the test case will be from haplotype A. I will also upload the prediction results to the github repo. 2) For HPRC, our data is phased genome assembly, not the raw HiFi reads. But I think the annotation module of your package might be useful after extracting the KIR region. For our KIR annotation procedure on the phased assembly, it's not a software. It's just running minimap2, bwa and then parse the results. The scripts are in the HPRC folder of the github repo, and I will add a better README there. The phased assemblies may be released soon. I can ask around. 3) What do you mean by exon variants here? 4) We also noticed sometimes the intronic variation might not be well represented. Therefore, T1K has a parameter --relaxIntronAlign to consider suboptimal alignments where the worse parts are in the intron. Thank you for your helpful suggestions.

This review reflects comments provided by the following students (in alphabetical order by last name) : Michelle Chong, Eleazar DeAlmeida, J. Carlos Gomez, Deannakayte Marucut, Liz Mathiasen, Raquel Reyes, Karina Rodriguez, Abdellah Shraim, Matt Suntay, Yaqoub Yusuf Comments and review compiled by Dr. Ashley Albright To understand the role of kinases in the origins of multicellularity and animal development, the authors conducted a small molecule screen of kinase inhibitors in choanoflagellates, the closest living relatives of animals. Genetic tools in choanoflagellates, as well as other emerging model systems are limited. This approach using small molecule inhibitors rather than genetic tools to screen for phenotypic changes will not only be invaluable for choanoflagellate researchers, but researchers using other organisms as well. The authors found that sorafenib, a p38 kinase inhibitor, inhibits choanoflagellate cell proliferation. Furthermore, S. rosetta p38 is activated by environmental stressors (heat and oxidative stress), suggesting a conserved role for p38 kinases. Ultimately, the results of this study show that small molecule screens are a valuable approach to understand biology in emerging model systems, especially when available tools are limited. Students in our course come from a variety of scientific backgrounds, and many are new to reading scientific papers. Therefore, our comments focus on readability and significance more so than methodology and strength of results. Comments: 1. While we appreciate the conciseness of the introduction, we felt that the authors could provide additional information on the background of choanoflagellate research and why they are used as a model organism. The authors do mention, “Choanoflagellates possess homologs of diverse animal kinases (Figure S1) (9–11) and due to their phylogenetic placement are relevant for reconstructing the ancestral functions of animal cell signaling proteins (12, 13).” However, we believe the connection between choanoflagellate research and the origins of multicellularity could be more explicit. 2. Similar to the comment above, we felt that the authors could provide more background information on small molecule phenotypic screens and limited genetic tools. We understand the benefit that they provide in cases where genetic tools are limited, but how are the tools limited in choanoflagellates exactly? We are also curious about other small molecule screens. Why were kinases targeted in this case? 3. The results were described in great detail, making interpretations of the data easier for people outside of the field; however, we feel that the connection between results and conclusion in some cases were less clear. As an example, the authors state: “These findings showed that glesatinib disrupts both cell proliferation and tyrosine kinase signaling. Together these observations provide independent support for the hypothesis that kinase signaling regulates cell proliferation in choanoflagellates.” How exactly does tyrosine kinase signaling relate to cell proliferation compared to other kinase signaling? 4. The authors report that effects of sorafenib on cell proliferation are dose-dependent. We would like to know if this response is density-dependent as well. Other Thoughts and Questions: 1. Would this approach yield similar results in other species of choanoflagellates? Other protists? Basal animals? Plants? 2. We would like to see these experiments repeated for other hit compounds. 3. The authors mention that this approach is normally used in drug discovery, how does what was discovered through this screen relate to human disease?",2022-11-23T19:46:10,ashley_albright,Ashley Albright,10.1101/2022.08.26.505350,A small molecule screen reveals the essentiality of p38 kinase for choanoflagellate cell proliferation,"Florentine U.N.

The authors should be commended on the pre-registration of their experiment. Major comments: 1. Throughout the paper, the authors refer to sequence of movements, which many people will find misleading as this seems to refer to sequence learning literature while no sequences are learned in the paper. 2. the two outcomes measured are treated differently. While the perpendicular error is corrected for baseline bias, the force measured during error-clamp trials is not. This has traditionally been the case in the force-field literature. Alternatively, the authors could compare the force exerted at the end of the adaptation period with the force exerted during the last block of baseline. 3. It would be nice to provide the equation of the statistical model used for the mixed model as different 4. Non-significant p-values should be treated more carefully. For instance, on line 387-388, the authors mentioned two non-significant p-values (p=0.0625 and p=0.0703) and conclude on the absence of effect. Same for line 399. Does p=0.1 really means that there is no difference. This problem is partially caused by the tiny sample size of the three bimanual groups (N=8). This also prevents us from estimating the effect size with high certainty. 5. I don't understand how the analysis of Fig.6F can tell us anything about transfer of adaptation. You compare blocks 46-50 of the adaptation periods to blocks 1-5 of re-adaptation. What does this difference mean? There is also absolutely no information about the performance just before re-adaptation. Are people really back to baseline in all groups? Fig.6A and B suggest that this is not the case.In that case, I don't think that it is possible assess the transfer of learning because people are re-adapting from an unknown state. 6. It was my understanding that the Kinarm Exoskeleton was not enough stiff to perform reliable channel trials. Could you provide information about how straight the channel trials were ? In addition, the force during channel trials are usually measured by a force transducer placed on the handle. How was the force computed here? How did you go form the force exerted at the elbow and shoulder joint to the force exerted at the end?",2022-11-23T13:48:58,disqus_Obrwp25I6P,JJ,10.1101/2022.11.22.517483,Prior movement of one arm facilitates motor adaptation in the other,"M.

For samples such as HPRC that have PacBio HiFi data, you could use the annotate workflow from kass[1] to annotate haplotypes and assemblies. What happens to the KIR genotype calls when a real novel exon variant is encountered in the reads? If reads are multi-mapped, and abundances are summed within the same allele series, won't that bias the calls towards reference exon alleles with more reference intronic variation? Often times, these alleles (allele series) are also the most frequent, which might cause other problems. 1. https://github.com/droeatum...",2022-11-17T22:35:56,disqus_cSKYCAZ9mS,David Roe,10.1101/2022.10.26.513955,T1K: efficient and accurate KIR and HLA genotyping with next-generation sequencing data,"Li Song, Gali Bai, X.

This preprint describes the first structures of mitochondrial complex I from Drosophila melanogaster (Dm). The work is done carefully technically and is a valuable addition to the current set of complex I structures from various species, previously lacking representatives from insects or Protostomia clade in general. Complex I from Protostomia, in contrast to that Deuterostomia including mammals, appears to lack so-called “deactive” state, which is important for mechanistic discussion. In this study authors find that apo (i.e. in the absence of any substrates or turnover) Dm complex I (DmCI) can adopt two main conformations, resembling so-called “open” and “closed” states seen previously with other species. Uniquely, one of DmCI states is characterized by the ordered N-terminal helix of the accessory NDUFS4 (18 kDa) subunit, which wedges between the peripheral (PA) and membrane (MA) arms. This was not seen in other structures and appears to be a specific feature of Dm and closely related species. Authors suggest that the helix may temporarily “lock” this DmCI conformation. However, it may instead just reflect the ordering of a particular structural element in one of complex I states, as seen for different parts of complex I in other species. Overall, the new DmCI structures are consistent with our recent mechanistic proposals [1, 2] and complement the emerging picture. However, the discussion of the two states in this work is very confusing in my opinion, which is why I wrote this comment. It is surprising that the DmCI states were labelled as they were (locked open and closed) while it is clear that it should be other way round (locked closed and open). DmCI states were assigned by authors on the basis of PA-MA angle if complex I is viewed sideways, as we did for ovine complex I originally [1, 3]. In what authors called here the closed state this angle is very slightly smaller than in the other state, thus the assignment. However, it is clear from Fig. 4- suppl. 2A and movies that the main difference between the DmCI states is the rotation of PA, not the closing/opening of PA-MA angle. As we noted in our latest paper [2], the PA-MA angle is not a good indication of open or closed state – PA tilts in Ovine but mainly twists/rotates in E. coli. In E. coli the states are related by PA clockwise rotation (when looked from PA tip) when going from closed to open state. In the recent paper on Chaetonium complex I [4] – form 1 is clearly open state, form 2 is clearly closed (in our updated nomenclature as below). They are related by the PA clockwise rotation (when looked from PA tip) going closed-to-open (2-to-1). I.e. it is the same overall change as in E. coli. Therefore open and closed states should be attributed not by PA-MA angle, as we noted [2], but on the basis of: Open state - OPEN Q cavity (mostly disordered key loops, especially ND3) and pi-bulge in ND6 (as well as flipped out into lipid ND1 Y156 in E. coli / Y142 ovine). Closed state – CLOSED Q cavity (mostly ordered key loops, especially ND3), no pi-bulge in ND6 (as well as flipped in into E-channel ND1 Y156 in E. coli / Y142 ovine). So what was called locked open state in DmCI in fact clearly corresponds to closed state in our nomenclature (ND3 loop ordered, no pi-bulge). What was called closed state in DmCI is in fact open state (ND3 loop disordered, pi-bulge present). The only difference with E. coli open state is that NuoC beta1-2 loop is retracted in DmCI but is inserted into Q cavity in E. coli (incidentally, some of labels describing E. coli features are wrong in Fig.5-suppl1BC). However, in Ovine this loop is disordered in open state, so its conformation is not absolutely defined by the state (unlike ND3 loop and pi-bulge). Another difference is that in DmCI open state PSST loop is not flipped as in Ovine. However, in E. coli this loop does not flip either, so again its conformation is not absolutely defined by the state. Considering the re-assignment of states as we suggest then the PA rotation going closed-to-open is in the same direction in DmCI as in E. coli. A similar rotation was also noted in another recent manuscript on DmCI [5]. In summary, after re-assignment it is clear that main features defining closed and open states (in our nomenclature) in DmCI are the same as in Ovine, E. coli and Chaetonium. It is possible that under turnover conditions in Drosophila even more of the features will become consistent (such as NuoC beta1-2 loop insertion in open state), however the assignment is already unambiguous. So to avoid confusing readers about what is open and what is closed state it would be great if authors renamed the classes according to our latest nomenclature as above. One potential question is that in parallel paper [5] (otherwise mostly consistent with this study) in Dm2 state (open state in our nomenclature) ND3 loop apparently remains ordered. However, Agip et al. did only global 3D classification on the entire complex I molecule which, according to our experience, is unlikely to fully separate classes - then any Dm1 (closed) state particles still present in Dm2 class would easily show ND3 loop density – we have seen this a lot when classification in not converged. Additionally, the resolution of Dm2 class is quite low. Considering authors comment here on the poor density of some regions in our Ovine deactive structures, I need to note that these data were post-processed with high B-factor suitable for the main bulk density. ND5-HL, TMH16ND5, NDUFA11 are indeed not well defined but are still present as we can re-activate this prep. However, if one applies blurring B-factor of about 100 in COOT (or filter maps to about 4A) to the deposited densities of deactive states, then except for open1, all other states (especially open3 and open4) show very clearly relocated ND6 TM4 density together with loop blocking PA/MA movements. It is clear that after full deactivation ND5-HL, TMH16ND5, NDUFA11 become flexible but still associated with complex, while ND6 TM4 together with its loop relocates. Authors also mention in discussion that in Yarrowia both open and closed states were observed. However, as we discussed in the SI of our paper [2], only one conformational state was observed under turnover conditions in Yarrowia. It resembles the open state of Ovine CI – pi-bulge present, ND3 loop disordered, etc. The reported conformational changes in Yarrowia CI [6] may in fact reflect the deactive to open state transition, and the closed state remains to be properly classified out. It is also a bit strange for authors to criticize our E. coli paper [2] on the basis on Kolata/Efremov paper [7] – we have clearly shown that the resting E. coli state is promoted by DDM detergent (which was used in [7]) and this is why we took a lot of care to fully purify enzyme in milder LMNG detergent, with clear data showing it is stable in LMNG. Further, air-to-water interface argument from authors is not applicable to our data – grids were made with continuous carbon layer support, so protein is never exposed to air during blotting/freezing. Authors also state that “thermophilic yeast Chaetonium thermophilum CI, which is found in multiple resting states, none of which corresponding to the open state seen in other species” [4] However, Chaetonium two states correspond very closely to Ovine open and closed states, as authors themselves state in [4]. So the point of the statement above is not clear. It seems like in the discussion the authors try hard to suggest alternatives to our mechanism, even though there are no real factual arguments here. One particular argument is that open states of complex I could be all deactive (as still suggested for mammals [5]) and do not participate in the catalytic cycle, with only closed state being part of catalytic cycle. However, all the new emerging data from species which do not have deactive state, i.e. E. coli [2], Chaetonium [4] and even including current Drosophila structures point out that closed-to-open transitions as part of catalytic cycle are universal. Overall, I hope that the discrepancies above will be corrected in the final paper. References 1.    Kampjut, D. and L.A. Sazanov, The coupling mechanism of mammalian respiratory complex I.

It is a comprehensive and very data-rich study you have performed, and definitely a valuable dataset for the community when data are all published. We have been discussing the preprint in the lab, and were very intrigued about your conclusion that S. cerevisiae runs aerobic glycolysis as means of being primed for anaerobic growth. We recently have explored growth strategies of another Crabtree-positive yeast, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and I believe its physiology serves as a counterargument to your conclusion. Wild-type S. pombe anaerobically halts growth almost completely (e.g. Heslot 1970 J Bacteriol), and/or induce sexual development, a signature of severe stress. Aerobically, it has a clear disadvantage over S. cerevisiae: S. pombe grows ~25% slower in aerobic batch cultures than S.c. (specific growth rate of 0.3/h vs 0.4/h in S.c.) with a high specific fermentation flux (RQ of ~6), and switches to respirofermentation in glucose-limited chemostats earlier than S.c. (mu_crit/mu_max 0.53 vs 0.7 in WT S.c.). This is all even despite the fact S.p. has a higher P/O ratio (1.28 vs 1.0 in S.c.). So if intense fermentation is adaptation for anaerobic growth, why doesn't S. pombe go fully respiratory to outcompete other bugs in aerobic environments? I would be delighted if you could comment more on this. Thanks in advance!

A few suggestions: - In the current preprint, it is stated that “Visual inspection of the NTSR1-H4X:SR142948A complex, and two structures with the chemically-related antagonist SR48692 (NTSR1-H4X:SR48692 and NTSR1-H4bmX:SR48692), reveals that the M250(5.51) sidechain points away from the TM bundle...”. However, this is not entirely correct. In the NTSR1-H4bmX:SR48692 complex, M250 points towards, not away from, the TM bundle. - In Figures 3F and S8G,H, F347(7.31) is labeled incorrectly and should be F346(7.30). Y346(7.30) is also labeled incorrectly and should be Y347(7.31). - It is stated that “Addition of NT8-13 or SR142948A induces sizeable upfield chemical shift perturbations (Figure 3A).” However, the next sentence states that the peaks are approximately aligned, which I don’t understand: “The positions of the M2044.60 peak in the apo, NT8-13 and SR142948A bound forms are approximately aligned, despite the different nature of the ligands”. Do you actually mean the position of the M204 side chain in the crystal structures? - It is also stated: “Thus, it suggests the main effect of the ligands on M204(4.60) chemical shifts is through the modulation of the contacts with other receptor residues, rather than the direct effect of the ligand on the methionine methyl group.” Don’t you think the ligands could indeed have a strong direct effect? The apo pocket is obviously empty, whereas in the NT8-13 and SR14 complexes, M204 is rather close to the isobutyl and adamantyl moieties of the ligands, respectively.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.18.512756v1#comment-6035707945,biorxivstage,3,"Dear Alex Crits-Christoph, Thanks for taking a look into our preprint. Let me share a few thoughts regarding the points you raised: 1) you argue that the presence of similar sites in related viruses is an indication for recombination/natural origin, which speaks against bioengineering. This is wrong: 1a) even if you had only one viral genome, such as Banal-20-52, 3 of the 5 sites would be modified by a bioengineer in exactly the way observed in SC2, see Table S3. There are just not that many options to introduce/remove these sites with only synonymous wobble mutations. Of note, the other 2 sites (3rd BsmBI site and 1st BsaI site) are present in RaTG13, which was most likely sequenced in 2018 https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv... and certainly known to WIV researchers. 1b) as we describe in the preprint, researchers have aligned restriction sites in different reverse genetics systems (Becker et al 2008). The WIV was in possession of thousands of viral samples in 2019 according to Daszak. Access to the respective viral genome databases was not even granted to the WHO commission (indicating there was something to hide). The fact that this commission was led by the most conflicted person in the world is also something I haven't seen in any other field, at least not in the last 100 years. 1c) A bioengineer would manipulate a site using mutations functional in other genomes to reduce the risk of disturbing secondary RNA structures. 2) You argue that a predicted common ancestor such as recCA, in which some of these sites are also present, does indicate they originated from recombination. Let’s be clear, we should have discussed recombination as a potential source altered RS in our preprint. And we should have discussed RpYN06. I had missed that Zhihua had pointed out that neighboring regions independently indicate a recombination, as this was posted in a very long thread listing lots of examples of sites being present in related viruses, which by itself is irrelevant, as discussed in 1. It was an honest mistake. RpYN06 was also not discussed in that recCA graph. However, your argument about recCA is wrong. 2a) If an ancestor is predicted based on SC2, we have a circular argument as pointed out by Prof. Bloom. A segment of this ancestor could be predicted completely based on SC2. Thus, if an engineer would introduce a protein sequence such as “THISISSYNTHETIC”, it could appeare just like that in the predicted ancestor. In fact, introducing alterations would make a section more unique and increase the likelihood that this section will be found in the ancestor. 3) J. Pekar predicted a common ancestor excluding SC2. This is a good counterargument, in fact the probably the only valid one. Still, it does not withstand scientific review. 3a) The problem is that if we consider a lab leak could have occured, we have to consider that related genomes published by Chinese researchers after the outbrake could be manipulated, which is easy to do. I started looking into the raw reads, publication history and sequences of some of these genomes, including RaTG13, RpYN06, RmYN02 and talked to field experts. Many clear indications of manipulation in these genomes arose: - missing bacterial reads https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv... - lots of reads of laboratory vectors in RpYN06 - too few bat reads in RaTG13 and RpYN06 - abnormal rRNA 3’-ETS reads in RpYN06 and RmYN02 - RaTG13 was initially not linked to Ra4991 - more than 60 (!!!) consecutive nonsynonymous mutations in the S2 of RaTG13 - frequently altered datasets https://usrtk.org/covid-19-... - numerous other anomalies inconsistent with fecal samples https://vixra.org/pdf/2010.... https://www.preprints.org/m... https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go... Looks like we both failed to do our homework here, me in the last weeks, you and your colleagues in the last years. The fact that RaTG13 contains 60 consecutive nonsynonymous in S2 is by itself inconsistent with expectations from natural evolution. So we will either exclude these highly problematic genomes or keep them in a separate analysis, clearly indicating these issues. You and your colleagues should do the same in affected publications IMO. But let’s pretend these issues would not exist, or that one can find some reasonable explanation for these anomalies. Let’s look at the BsmBI site at 22926 in RaTG13. It’s CGTCTC sequence codes for RL. In SC2 Hu1 the same RL is coded for by AGATTG. There are 4 (!!!) synonymous mutations in these 6 nucleotides. I could not find anything like this RaTG13 in related genomes. So the entire recombination argument is only valid if you, at the same time, say RaTG13 and the other genomes are not manipulated and can predict a valid ancestor and ignore that random mutation or recombinations cannot explain where these sites in RaTG13 came from. The significantly higher rate of silent mutations within BsaI/BsmBI recognition sites comparing SC2 and is independent of potential recombination events leading to these sites in SC2. Both a manipulated RaTG13 genome or manipulated BsaI/BsmBI sites in SC2 lead to the same conclusion, a synthetic origin. 4 J. Pekar stated it would be expected to get one last mutation not explainable by recombination. This is wrong. 4a) Is would be very unusual to get the last dS mutation at exactly the needed position. Let’s say only 1 dS can complete an ”almost” complete BsaI site. There will be 5x6-1 positions were a mutation could destroy a rev. gen. system. Even if only 15 of these 29 positions are dS and not selected against, in each of these sites 2-3 dS mutations could be possible, which gives you only a ~2-3% chance that this last mutation will complete a rev. gen. system rather than destroying it. 5 Another point raised was that we cherry-picked BsaI and BsmBI. This is wrong. -> This combination is often used to generate SC2 infectious clones. It was used by the WIV for spike substitutions before. And any bioengineer would immediately see that using these sites in a Banal-like ancestor requires very few modifications, which is always preferred. Still, we did run simulations for equally efficient endonucleases, it didn’t change much. By the way, did you talk to any bioengineer before suggesting we should withdraw this bioengineering preprint? I got the impression none of the scientists linked in your post have substantial experience in designing parallel screening assays as implied in Fig 1 and as one would need to do the work proposed in the DEFUSE proposal. Also, a protein alignment of RaTG13 and SC2 also strongly indicates micromanipulations in the RBM and FCS, exactly as proposed in the DEFUSE proposal. So does further evidence: This paper: https://assets.researchsqua... indicates that bat-SL-CoVZC45/ a synthetic variant was generated exactly as our preprint suggests for SC2 using pUC57 (!!!) plasmids. This preprint: https://www.researchsquare.... indicates a direct ancestor of all human SC2 lines was cultured on Vero or CHO cells. Vero are mentioned in the DEFUSE proposal. CHO are used to test hACE2 binding, as mentioned in the DEFUSE proposal (see e.g. PMC7095783 or hACE2 expressing CHO). Deep sequencing was done by a company called Sangon, which is also mentioned in the DEFUSE proposal. Then there is the human-identical FCS found in SC2. Hundreds of possible combinations could lead to a functional FCSs. SC2 contains a human-identical one, exactly as suggested in the DEFUSE proposal, and one described in the University of Ralph Baric, one of the DEFUSE applicants https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... Regarding Kristian Andersen’s and Stuart Neil’s tweets: they had both blocked me before criticizing our work. Seriously, what is going on here… Just in case they did post anything of relevance, let me know.

Future studies can benefit from the dataset provided, which can serve as a valuable resource. An intriguing finding was the substantial similarity between xenografted microglia and ex vivo human microglia subsets, emphasizing the importance of environment on microglial profiles. We believe that a few experimental and analysis additions or discussion points would further enhance the overall impact of this study. Following are a few thoughts from our group: 1. Although we understand that using a ""proteomic ruler"" may not always be suitable, using both copy numbers and concentration may complicate the interpretation of results. For example, could differences in total protein content also explain the differences in proteins associated with glycolysis, mitochondria, ribosomes, and the nuclear envelope (Fig 1e)? 2. Would using mouse stem cell-derived microglia or primary mouse microglia cultured in vitro upon isolation be a more relevant in vitro mouse microglia model, as opposed to the BV2 mouse line? 3.Did the analysis of the proteins identified in only one subset reveal any distinct signatures? 4.We believe additional details would benefit the Methods section of the manuscript. Among these are (a) sharing age and gender data concerning the patients included in the human ex vivo subset and (b) showing the gating strategy for pure microglia isolation (in ex vivo and xenografted subsets). 5. Moreover, we were a bit confused by the fact that the ex vivo and xenotransplanted mice were not the same age (3.5 months vs. 2.5 months old, respectively). 6. Similarly, it is challenging to compare xenografted microglia with ESC-derived microglia since they are at different stages of maturation (10 weeks vs. 1 week, respectively). 7.

Since the results are largely based on antibodies that are specific to each NPR1, NPR2 and NPR3, and since these three proteins have some sequence homology, then some additional information on the antibodies may be needed to robustly confirm this intriguing conclusion. Are the NPR antibodies monoclonal, and what region of each protein is recognized? What would also help would be to show the full lane for each blot, ideally including size markers. The anti-NPR3 blots appear to cut off where the anti-NPR1 signal runs, and vice-versa. Each antibody could be validated for recognition of its specific target, and lack of recognition of the other two homologous targets. The validations are needed only for whichever of the three methods (western, immunoprecipitation, or immunohistochemistry) was used for that antibody. It would also help to explain if the p62 protein is a receptor protein and to confirm that p62 is in the cell membrane fraction, like NPR1, NPR2 and NPR3. Also, the dimer is one possible form of the NPR enzymes. The few studies that have been done with purified, active mammalian NPR have identified a tetramer for NPR1 (PMID: 1657900 & 35821229).

To determine how far a nascent protein might diffuse on these timescales (i.e. the spatial resolution of the method), we calculated the expected displacement as a function of time, based on the previously measured diffusion coefficient of GFP in the cytosol (Di Rienzo et al., 2014; Figure 5). This calculation depends on the dimensionality of space in which the molecule is confined. However, even in the most limiting case of one-dimensional diffusion—approximating movement along a very narrow neural projection—a protein is expected to diffuse ~100 µm in less than 1 min. This distance is large compared to both the scale of the relevant structures to which protein synthesis was localized in neurons (tens of microns) (tom Dieck et al., 2015; Biever et al., 2020), and to the diameter of HeLa cells (~20 microns) (Borle, 1969), in which the method was demonstrated (David et al., 2012). Thus, limiting puromycin treatment time to a few minutes does not ensure that nascent proteins remain confined to the subcellular region in which they are synthesized. More Using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) diffusion in CHO cells as a model for endogenous protein diffusion is not the most appropriate. In non-native cells, the diffusion of GFP is influenced by molecular crowding of its environment, as it likely does not have any abundant endogenous protein interaction partners (e.g. aequorin). For example, the GFP diffusion value cited by Enam et al. in Figure 5, (dark green line in our linked Figure), derived from studies in CHO cells, is much faster than the GFP diffusion values obtained in neuronal compartments like axons (light green line in Figure) (Reshetniak et al., 2020). In fact, and even better, there are direct data available on the diffusion of puromycylated peptides in a neuron-derived cell line (Ge et al., 2016) (purple line in Figure). The diffusion of puromycylated peptides measured directly in Ge et al., is ~ 10-fold slower than the diffusion of cytosolic GFP in CHO cells shown in Figure 5 of Enam et al. In addition, many groups have directly studied the diffusion of neuronal proteins in mature neurons- and again found diffusion values that are much slower than cytosolic GFP in the same subcellular compartment (grey line in Figure). As such, we believe that puromycin, when used appropriately, can be used in neurons to ascertain or validate the location of nascent proteins in or near the compartment (axonal or dendritic) in which they were synthesized. Practically speaking, measurements should be made in distal processes (e.g. > 50 microns from the cell body) following short-labelling times (~ 5 min) using a low (~2 – 5 uM) puromycin concentration– these are the typical parameters used by most experimenters, including our group. link to Figure: https://schumanlab.github.i...

The involvement of some of the transcription factors of interest in the present work (SOX10, FOXD3, CHD7), were also established in human neural crest and other embryonic tissues in this early transcriptomics paper back in 2008 (Hum Mol Genet. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddn235): ""We finally examined the spatial expression of a selection of genes identified by SAGE using in situ hybridization on human embryo sections at C13 (Fig. 4).

The binding pocket changes based on the assembly environment and may even be subtly changing hexamer to hexamer and pentamer to pentamer based on the curvature within the assembled capsids.  There are many labs working out the specifics of the different binding interactions at various stages of post-entry and integration including our lab, currently",2022-11-05T01:23:47,randallschirrashyra,Randall Schirra (Shyra),10.1101/2022.08.25.505312,A molecular switch modulates assembly and host factor binding of the HIV-1 capsid,"Randall T.

(1) Unfortunately JunctionSeq is not available in the current Bioconductor release (it appears to not be actively supported), so it would be difficult for me to implement any options to adapt it into the SpliceWiz pipeline (due to compatibility issues, etc). Nevertheless, as I understand, JunctionSeq utilises both exon and junction reads which is a different philosophy than that of SpliceWiz which only uses junctions (except in IR). One issue with STAR's SJ.out.tab is that when read pairs overlap a region that contains a splice junction, that junction is counted twice! In SpliceWiz, read pairs are treated as fragments and so coverage is not double-counted. This is also another feature in our coverage plots: unlike IGV, coverage from overlapping read pairs are not counted twice. Conceptually, read-pairs arise from the same RNA molecule, so the coverage and junction counts should not be counted twice. I'm not familiar with QoRTs and whether or not it suffers from the same issue. SpliceWiz treats included and excluded reads as separate matrices, and GLM-based contrasts in DESeq and limma wrappers evaluate the interaction between these matrices and the contrasting variable as their readouts. A helpful explanation of this approach by the DESeq2 author can be found here: http://rstudio-pubs-static.... In the end, users would choose a tool based on a number of factors - ease of use, ease of experimental validation of the detected signals, ease of user understanding of how the data is wrangled. SpliceWiz offers a simplistic view of splicing using the traditional concept of it being a binary event (e.g. skipped vs included cassette exons, etc), which is (hopefully) easy to understand for researchers. This may well be at the expense of detecting complex (more-than-one-step) splicing events which is one limitation. (2) Although our group's prior contribution (IRFinder) assesses""all"" introns as putative IR events (a good assumption at the time as IR was relatively unknown back then), SpliceWiz makes the distinction of annotated vs unannotated IR in that annotated IR means a transcript from the GTF contains an exon that fully overlaps an intron in another transcript. This is useful for the purposes of benchmarking using simulators like flux-simulator, where our input is transcript_id and TPM values (meaning it can't simulate IR events if the IR-transcript is not already annotated). We discovered our annotation approach discovered 3x more annotated IR events than rMATS and SUPPA2, and Figure S4 essentially explains why. We don't believe these extra annotated events affects false positive rates (I agree it would be useful to formally test this!). The reason is the general principle of assessing ASEs as""local"" events - which is based on the assumption the event occurs independently of other ASEs outside the locus. Whether the other end(s) of the exons of the IR event is differentially spliced should not be relevant to the IR at the intron of interest.

Regarding polygenes, they cite a 1992 paper of Naveira (2), rather than his 1998 summary of work carried out with Maside (3). They appreciate my drawing this to their attention and have suggested that readers of their preprint paper would appreciate a formal comment. At issue is whether, when genomically dispersed, the term “polygenes” should be interpreted as “many genes,” or something else. Pondering why incompatibility factors are so dispersed they write (1): “One of our key findings is that many factors of perhaps individually small effects are widely dispersed across autosomes or on the Z chromosome. Consequently, average chromosomal ancestry is often more informative of phenotypes than any particular locus. This pattern is similar to the polygenic threshold model of hybrid incompatibility in Drosophila, where abnormal phenotypes depend more on the total quantity of introgression than where introgression occurs in the genome [41, 42, 43].” Their first reference here “[41]” is to Naveira’s 1992 report on polygenic effects causing sterility in male fruit fly hybrids. However, they do not mention his subsequent detailed studies with Maside that were summarized in 1998 (3). These concluded that, rather than genes per se, “it might be only a question of foreign DNA amount.” Thus, “experiments on the nature of these polygenes suggest that the coding potential of their DNA may be irrelevant.” The Naviera-Maside hypothesis was cited in a 2000 paper on Haldane's rule (4), but it has been largely overlooked in the literature. There appears to be no discussion of the hypothesis in the paper of Xiong et al. (1), even though the case for it has grown appreciably (5). It is also important in view of their paper's opening remarks on ""the sex with the greatest fitness costs."" Fitness usually implies genes. However, sterility and fitness do not necessarily go together. A mule is sterile but very fit. So being ""fit"" is subtle and it may be unwise to imply that a sterile organism is necessarily unfit, especially when that sterility is considered ""largely phenomenological."" Thus, it is good that Xiong et al. write of ""incompatability factors"" rather than of ""incompatability genes"" (1), which implies phenotypes.

When the changes were evaluated in our tumor samples it appears that multiple changes resulted from incorrect mapping of the sequence reads. For example, the PHF2 variants, which occurred at the first 2 bases of intron 16, corresponded to the first 2 bases of exon 17. These are visible in IGV when soft clipping is turned off, and the first 5 bases that were proposed to be intronic also matched the first 5 bases of exon 17, which is indicative of the problem of mapping RNA-seq reads properly. This was not true of all of the changes, as the G>A changes in NEIL1 mapped to exonic sequences, but we also have transcriptome data from matched normal tissue samples from 1 of our patients where expression of these variants was observed. This is another issue that has not to my knowledge been adequately addressed, as normal tissues express ADAR, indicating that these changes may not be tumor-specific. Finally, there is the issue of the high error rate of reverse transcription, which may not occur equally at all sites. This is a problem that is not easy to resolve, unless these changes are directly probed, which would seem like a good way of potentially validating these changes.",2022-11-02T18:28:17,disqus_1ruehpT9ca,Paul Robbins,10.1101/2022.09.17.508207,Proteogenomic analysis reveals RNA as an important source for tumor-agnostic neoantigen identification correlating with T-cell infiltration,"Celina Tretter, Niklas de Andrade Krätzig, Matteo Pecoraro, Sebastian Lange, Philipp Seifert, Clara von Frankenberg, Johannes Untch, Florian S Dreyer, Eva Bräunlein, Mathias Wilhelm, Daniel P Zolg, Thomas Engleitner, Sebastian Uhrig, Melanie Boxberg, Katja Steiger, Julia Slotta-Huspenina, Sebastian Ochsenreither, Nikolas von Bubnoff, Sebastian Bauer, Melanie Boerries, Philipp J Jost, Kristina Schenck, Iska Dresing, Florian Bassermann, Helmut Friess, Daniel Reim, Konrad Grützmann, Katrin Pfütze, Barbara Klink, Evelin Schrock, Bernhard Haller, Bernhard Kuster, Matthias Mann, Wilko Weichert, Stefan Fröhling, Roland Rad, Michael Hiltensperger, Angela M Krackhardt",2022-09-18
