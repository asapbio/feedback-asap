Consistent with this observation, the average match rate in Native Americans (and Oceanians) for segments of at least 0.1cM does not stand out from that of other populations (Fig. S104). It is likely that the results for Native Americans are confounded by greater genetic drift between the allele frequencies of Native Americans and those of Africans used as reference for distinguishing archaic and modern human ancestry."" So basically the research team apriori assumes that Amerindians are recent and hence label Amerindians' excessive matches to a 200,000 year old Denisovan sequence as ""false positives"". This does not take into account the hypothesis that modern humans originated from an East Asian hominin, speciated in the New World into anatomically and behaviorally modern humans and expanded out of America as a single wave into the Old World where they admixed with later Denisovans (in Oceania and Asia), Neandertals in Asia and Europe and with archaic Africans in Africa.

In Valentino et al. 2022 ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35288123/) the authors mathematically predict that Drosophila germ granule proteins have a functional role in mediating mRNA localization and germ granule composition of nos and pgc. By adding several new theoretical germ granule behaviors to the mathematical model, the authors conclude “that the germ granule protein ensemble has a significant influence on germ granule mRNA composition [mRNA localization], which is consistent with studies showing the importance of protein-based condensation mechanisms in the assembly of RNA-rich P granules in C. elegans (Folkmann, et al. 2021and Schmidt et al. 2021)."" For example, one parameter includes a soft cap for germ granule mRNA carrying capacity that represents Osk’s biophysical ability to fluctuate between granules, first identified in Trcek et al. 2020. “The soft cap allows for granules to recruit and contain mRNA clusters that are larger than their carrying capacity.” By incorporating a soft cap that can recapitulate biological data, their results support “the presence of support proteins within the granule that can stabilize [mRNA] clusters.” Given the mathematical predictions of the existence of functional roles for non-Osk germ granule proteins in mRNA localization from Valentino et al. 2022, it would be helpful to the field and exciting to read about a more detailed introduction and discussion connecting the experimental results of this study to the mathematical modeling results from previous Drosophila germ granule research.",2026-01-02T02:01:42,,Matthew Niepielko,,,,

We discussed it in my lab recently and have a suggestion for the authors. Briefly, we are concerned that the claim that GBP1 is a negative regulator of biological nitrogen fixation may be affected by the normalization approach used for nitrogenease activity (ARA). In this manuscript, as far as I understand, the ARA data were normalized with the nodule weight.  The authors show that the number of nodule per plant is not affected by the gbp1 mutations, but the images of nodules provided suggest that gbp1 nodules are slightly smaller than wild-type nodules. If the nodule weight is smaller in gbp1 mutants than in wild-type plants, the normalized ARA activity may appear larger in the gbp1 mutants than in wild-type plants. We suggest that the authors add data on nodule weight in gbp1 mutants and wild-type plants, and present ARA data normalized per nodule or per plant, in addition to the data already shown. They probably already have this data, and it could strengthen their manuscript. I hope that this will help a bit! Sincerely, Jean-Michel",2026-01-01T17:24:31,jeanmichelan,Jean-Michel Ané,,,,

Thus, LMCs likely rely on a telocyte network for signal conduction. Consistently, telocytes mediate rhythmic electrical activity in other tissues (65), which is believed to depend on ion channels for generating pacemaking currents (66, 67). Interestingly, electrically coupled cells are typically connected by gap junctions (63), and evidence demonstrating this physical link between telocytes and LMCs does not exist (6). "" should be corrected. LMCs have  been shown to express the calcium activated chloride current Ano1/TMEM16a in multiple publications and this channel is responsible for pacemaker activity in ICCs (PMID: 30862712, 37851027, 38704841, 40932335, 41279936.

The authors demonstrate that Rho functions in mature neurons to promote egg laying, as well as in vulval muscle. By using calcium imaging, the authors were able to demonstrate how Rho signaling (specifically in the HSN neurons) regulates cell excitability presynaptically (HSN) and postsynaptically (vulval muscles). We found the experiments to be well designed and the data to be robust, with the major conclusions to be supported by the data. Minor comments: 1)	The introduction included a detailed analysis of the Gq signaling pathway and the candidate targets that regulate neuronal activity (i.e. DAG-regulated effectors and ion channels), but the scope of the paper does not include testing or identifying the targets downstream of TrioRhoGEF/Rho. On the other hand, the focus of this manuscript is neurotransmission in the egg laying circuit, and little detail is provided about how and what neurotransmitters are released by HSN. Only in the results section is NLP-3 mentioned, but it is known that both serotonin and NLP-3 released from HSN each contribute significantly to egg laying. 2)	The authors conclude that Rho promotes synaptic transmission, and this is on the whole correct, but the authors could be more careful/precise with their wording and interpretations. As noted in comment 1, both serotonin and NLP-3 contribute to synaptic transmission in the egg laying circuit, but it is not known how directly these two components act in synaptic transmission. For example, NLP-3 is a neuropeptide that is released from dense core vesicles (DCVs), and it is possible that serotonin is also incorporated into DCVs as well as synaptic vesicles. In addition, serotonin and NLP-3 are known to act extrasynaptically as well as synaptically, and it is possible that Rho contributes to extrasynaptic release of serotonin and NLP-3. 3)	When analyzing their data, the authors bin calcium imaging measurements in the active vs inactive state. The active and inactive egg laying states are characteristic for wildtype worms, but as the authors show, altering the activity of the HSN affects egg laying. Another interpretation of their data is that when Rho is activated (HSN::Rho-1(G14V)) the worm is always in the active egg laying state, and when Rho is inhibited (HSN C3 Transferase) the worm never enters the active egg laying state. While we don’t think they need to change how they analyze the data, the authors could just add this interpretation to the discussion. 4)	We feel like the authors should include a more detailed discussion of why they see a difference in the effect of expressing dominant negative Rho (T19N) vs the C3 transferase in HSN. Why did Rho-1(T19N) expressed in HSN not show such a clear inhibition of calcium activity and egg laying as the C3 transferase expressed in HSN? 5)	In general, gain-of-function experiments are hard to interpret. Activated Rho could increase cell excitability, but that does not necessarily mean that is the function of Rho normally. The loss-of-function experiments are more convincing, aside from the discrepancy we noted in comment 4. This could be noted in the discussion. 6)	Lines 148 & 179: provide more detail or a reference for how extrachromosomal arrays were integrated. 7)	Lines 195 & 214: it is unclear how GCaMP arrays were confirmed by mCherry fluorescence (nlp-3p::mCherry) given that these strains also have arrays carrying tph-1p::mCherry and both nlp-3p::mCherry and tph-1p::mCherry should express in the HSNs. 8)	Line 339: the authors conclude that Rho acts “downstream of Trio RhoGEF.” However, the data show that a Trio mutant is only partially bypassed by expression of activated Rho – i.e. # of eggs is intermediate between the Trio mutant alone and activated Rho alone. These data are consistent with Rho acting downstream of Trio, but with RhoGEF activity still contributing to full activation of the “activated” Rho(G14V). The data would also be consistent with Trio and Rho acting at least partially in parallel, which could occur within the same cell or in different cells. A further complication to the interpretation of these data is that different activated Rho arrays are used in the WT and Trio mutant backgrounds. These different arrays could have different expression levels, which is a big caveat to making these comparisons. Ideally, one would use the same array in the WT and Trio mutant backgrounds. 9)	p. 16, lines 348-459: many of the Fig 2 callouts on this page refer to the wrong panel. 10)	Line 347: says 70%, but the data in the figure show >80%. 11)	Line 348: says 3 +/- 1 eggs, but Fig 2B says 3 +/- 0.2 eggs for same strain. 12)	Line 363: we were confused by this. Are the authors suggesting that you can’t quantitatively compare the effects of the HSN vs. muscle specific expression of activated Rho(G14V) because the arrays are mosaic? While it is true that the arrays may be mosaic, they also carry an mCherry marker expressed in the same cells, so they should know whether the array is expressing activated Rho as intended in the worms assayed, and it is unclear why mosaicism is an issue. A bigger issue to quantitatively comparing these strains is that they probably have different expression levels of activated Rho. 13)	Line 396: “outside of egg-laying active states (Figure 3A).” However, the data in Fig 3A shows HSN activity “during an egg-laying active state” according to the figure legend. Data showing activity outside egg-laying active states are not shown, but should be presented. 14)	Line 423: it is unclear how “instantaneous” transient frequency is defined. This should be added to the methods or figure legend. 15)	Line 428: says “more than 5 transients per minute” but the data in Fig 3C show it to be just under 4 transients per minute. 16)	Line 561-562. “This difference largely resulted from a lack of twitch transients around egg-laying events in C3T-expressing animals.” This argument doesn’t make sense to us. How could a lack of twitch transients affect the amplitude of the transients that are seen? 17)	Line 648: “we do not see dramatic effects on HSN morphology and presynaptic structure upon Rho inactivation.” Presynaptic structure was not assayed, so this should be cut.

On my initial read, I found that the generational framework was a bit hard to understand. When the paper introduces the “F1” flies used for the phenotypic assays, it wasn’t immediately clear as to what “F1” was referring to. I had initially interpreted this as an “F1” relative to the start of the experiment. This left me confused since it wouldn’t make sense to perform the phenotypic assays on the F1 experimental populations. It wasn’t until I read through the supplementary materials that it became clear how “F1” was being defined in this context. There, you explained that the assays were conducted on the F1 generations of the experimentally evolved populations. I think this clarification is extremely important for interpreting the rest of the paper correctly. Perhaps making this more explicit in the main text would likely prevent similar confusion for other readers. The experimental design made a lot more sense to me once to me once this confusion was cleared up. Overall, a great read! Cheers, Casey",2025-12-18T00:14:57,disqus_quRdHwhVIR,Casey Nichols,,,,

""Ancient"" is more appropriate for those proteins which are no longer around. E.g. there are works where people try to resurrect ancient proteins from phylogenetic trees of the existing ones. For example, lungfishes are ""archaic"" while ""ancient alpha-proteobacteria"" or even ""ancient proteobacteria"" are remarkably different from those we can study today, by the benefit of being able to infer some of their complexity from proteins of mitochondrial origin in eukaryotes. Originally I've seen this point made by one of the linguists about languages: Latin is an ancient language while some Baltic and Slavic languages may be considered archaic relative to the Proto-Indo-European. 2) Figure 2.

Throughout the paper I thought of several questions that I had regarding rationale behind parts of the study, interesting expansions that could be made to the study, and topics that were answered later on in the paper, such as what is a common-garden assay. Before I get to my questions/suggestions, I also wanted to note that I appreciated how consistent the paper was and that the authors mentioned important themes and contributing factors to the experiment throughout the paper, such as defining why phenotypic plasticity was such an important factor to study and analyze in this experiment. A few of the main questions I had are regarding the impact of bleach on fly eggs and how that can impact the experiment. I understand that F1 flies were used in their assays, according to their supplementary information, but I wanted to know more about how the bleach could impact the flies, even the F1 offspring. Another question, or even interest, I had was regarding why the comparisons of the experiment were between populations with microbes vs. without, instead of possibly comparing the effects of microbes that originated from different fly line populations. I understand why they only transferred fecal microbes from one fly line to keep all variables consistent, but I think further experiments on this could be interesting. The transfer of the fecal microbes leads to my next question, why were the MB flies created involving bleaching as well, with a reintroduction of microbes from one of the fly populations. From my understanding, if the microbes were transferred from a different fly line than the one chosen, this could have completely altered the outcome of the experiment, due to the variation of microbiomes between populations. Some other overall comments I had regarding the paper would be include more examples that were specific to drosophila, (the existing examples of things such as the stinkbugs were also important to the paper, though). Also, I believe there is a typo under the desiccation resistance portion of the methods section, (till al -> until all).

I'm happy to respond to some of the points you make with my own perspectives. A true mutualistic interaction is one in which both partners benefit from the interaction. ... There cannot be a true mutualism here. I respectfully disagree with this restrictive definition of mutualism. In ecological and evolutionary theory, mutualism is defined by positive net fitness consequences averaged across repeated interactions, rather than by the outcomes of individual encounters. For example, Holland and Bronstein (2008) define mutualism as “an interaction between individuals of different species that results in positive (beneficial) effects on per capita reproduction and/or survival of the interacting populations”. Many well-established mutualisms involve context-dependent risks to one partner without invalidating the interaction as mutualistic. Applied strictly, the quoted logic would also preclude classic seed-dispersal mutualisms, in which many seeds are consumed or destroyed, yet the interaction is nevertheless mutualistic when evaluated in terms of net fitness consequences. Likewise, many individual ants can be killed guarding their host plants, yet this interaction is also clearly mutualistic. In this sense, the disagreement appears to be somewhat semantic. In eusocial insects, fitness is most appropriately evaluated at the colony level. Resources acquired by individual workers during foraging are allocated toward colony maintenance and reproduction, such that colony fitness can increase even when individual workers are occasionally lost. So, repeated visitation of pitcher plants by worker wasps - even if they eventually lead to their capture - can still yield nutritional benefits that support colony growth and fitness, with these occasional capture events contributing nutrients to the plant. For example, consider that a 2% capture rate per visit implies a 98% success rate for the wasp — decent odds! Conversely, a 98% success rate for the pitcher leaf would lead to it filling up and fouling before any benefit could be reaped. as it stands there is no explicit justification given for using these wasps as opposed to any other group of insects I agree that the rationale for focusing on Vespula was not made sufficiently explicit in the original preprint. Social hymenopterans, particularly vespulid wasps, constitute a substantial fraction of the prey base of Darlingtonia, accounting for more than 50% of captured prey items in surveys, and owing to their size probably contribute more disproportionately to prey biomass (see Armitage 2016, Am J Bot). If pitcher plants contribute meaningfully to the nutritional budgets of social hymenopterans, then the plants' removal could be expected to reduce local wasp abundance or fitness. Conversely, reductions in social hymenopteran abundance would likely dramatically diminish prey-derived nutrient inputs to pitcher plants. While explicitly testing such feedbacks is beyond the scope of the present study, this perspective motivates our focus on Vespula.",2025-12-17T07:45:22,disqus_SG1MuXhSPr,Dave Armitage,,,,

The result is a set of compact, efficient DNA-cleavage ""tools"" that nature never explored but that nevertheless prove to be functional. A simple and elegant scheme for expanding the sequence space was used: an evolution-informed mask, derived from large paired datasets = protein + its native nucleic-acid-partner, locks functionally essential positions while leaving peripheral regions free to vary. The generative model is allowed to modify only these safe-to-vary positions, effectively unlocking large new areas of sequence space that expand natural evolutionary solutions. This approach can serve as a prospective strategy for “filling in the gaps” within sequence space regions where no experimentally annotated variants exist. Given large sets of evolutionarily linked pairs (protein-protein or protein-DNA/RNA), co-evolutionary signals identify functional anchor points, while generative models safely and systematically explore the vast surrounding regions. This enables the design of new sequences in those areas that natural evolution never sampled, thereby expanding the functional repertoire of biomolecules beyond the observable space.",2025-12-16T10:56:23,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.23.689982v1#comment-6807932747,biorxivstage,2,"The preprint ""Somatic mutations impose an entropic upper bound on human lifespan"" presents a significant methodological advance in gerontology by developing a structured, incremental modeling framework to dissect the complex process of aging (Efimov et al., 2025). A key contribution of this work is its demonstration of a fundamental asymmetry in how somatic mutations affect different tissue types. The finding that post-mitotic cells (neurons and cardiomyocytes) act as critical longevity bottlenecks, while highly regenerative tissues like the liver can maintain functionality for millennia through cellular turnover, provides crucial guidance for future therapeutic prioritization (Kirkwood, 1977; López-Otín et al., 2013). Furthermore, the application of reliability theory, modeling the human body as a system of serially and parallelly connected components, successfully translates engineering principles to a biological context, offering a robust quantitative foundation. However, the model notably overlooks critical evolutionary and biophysical determinants of human lifespan, particularly the deeply entrenched allometric relationship between brain size, metabolic rate, and maximum longevity. Anthropological and comparative biological studies have long established a robust scaling law, often expressed as Maximum Lifespan ≈ k * (Brain Mass)^α, where α approximates 0.56 (Sacher, 1959; Hofman, 1993). This relationship is not merely correlative but is underpinned by the immense metabolic cost of neural tissue. The human brain, representing only ~2% of body weight, consumes ~20-25% of the body's basal metabolic rate (BMR) (Aiello & Wheeler, 1995). This ""expensive tissue"" imposes a fundamental constraint: extending cognitive function and neural integrity over the model's predicted 134–170 year median lifespan would require not just resisting mutational entropy, but also sustaining this disproportionate energy allocation for over a century beyond current norms. This biophysical reality directly engages with the model's parameters. The study's calculated theoretical non-aging baseline of 430 years (at age-30 mortality) and its subsequent reduction by somatic mutations, while mathematically sound, exist in an evolutionary vacuum. As noted in ancillary paleoanthropological analyses, a projected increase in maximum lifespan (AÖ) to 200 years is evolutionarily coupled with a required expansion of brain capacity to nearly 5,700 cm³ and a significant rise in total caloric consumption (Bozcuk, 1982). The current model, by treating organ capacity (K) as a static, log-normally distributed variable, fails to incorporate the dynamic, co-evolutionary feedback between longevity, encephalization, and the body's energy budget. Sustaining a ~1.4 kg brain for 150 years is metabolically challenging; sustaining the larger brain implied by such longevity evolution would dramatically alter the energy landscape, potentially intensifying oxidative stress and influencing mutation rates themselves—a variable currently held constant. Thus, by isolating somatic mutation accumulation from the broader context of human encephalization and its requisite metabolic investment, the study risks presenting an upper bound that is neurobiologically and evolutionarily untenable. The ""entropic upper bound"" imposed by somatic mutations might be preempted by an earlier ""energetic upper bound"" imposed by the escalating cost of maintaining the very organ most critical to survival—the brain. A comprehensive model must integrate these scaling laws, recognizing that lifespan extension is not a singular process of damage repair but a systemic renegotiation of energy allocation and neural architecture (Robson & Wood, 2008; Fonseca-Azevedo & Herculano-Houzel, 2012). A further significant limitation is the model's disconnection from life history evolution and fertility dynamics. A core tenet of evolutionary biology is the trade-off between longevity and reproduction (Stearns, 1992). Historical and paleoanthropological data suggest that increases in lifespan are accompanied by delayed sexual maturation and extended reproductive periods (Bogin & Smith, 1996; Gurven & Kaplan, 2007). For instance, a lifespan extending to 150 or 200 years would logically shift the onset of reproduction to later ages (e.g., 22-27 or 30-37 years, respectively). The study's ""somatic-mutations-only"" scenario does not account for how such a dramatic shift in the reproductive window would impact population dynamics, intergenerational intervals, and genetic diversity. Ignoring these demographic and evolutionary feedback mechanisms limits the realism of the proposed lifespan extension, as reproductive strategy is a fundamental pillar of a species' survival and adaptation. Additionally, the model gives limited consideration to energy metabolism and other primary aging processes. Longevity is intricately linked not only to the accumulation of cellular damage but also to the economics of energy production, allocation, and consumption—concepts central to the Disposable Soma Theory (Kirkwood, 1977). The human brain is a metabolically expensive organ, consuming a disproportionate share of the body's energy budget (Aiello & Wheeler, 1995). Supporting its function over 150-200 years would impose immense metabolic costs, potentially exacerbating other aging hallmarks like mitochondrial dysfunction. By focusing predominantly on somatic mutations, the model sidelines the potential compounding effects and interactions with other critical aging processes such as loss of proteostasis, altered intercellular communication, and stem cell exhaustion (López-Otín et al., 2013). A comprehensive upper-bound estimate must integrate these interconnected mechanisms. In conclusion, Efimov et al. provide a valuable and sophisticated starting point for quantifying the theoretical limit imposed by one fundamental aging process. Yet, a truly holistic model of human longevity must integrate constraints from evolutionary biology, life history theory, and systems metabolism. Future research should aim to create integrative frameworks that simulate not only the accumulation of somatic mutations but also the co-evolution of brain and body, shifts in reproductive strategies, and metabolic adaptations required for extreme longevity. Such a multidisciplinary approach, bridging gerontology, evolutionary anthropology, and systems biology, will deepen our understanding of human lifespan limits and provide a more robust foundation for evaluating potential intervention strategies.

Here are our highlights: The authors test the popular idea that humans prefer partners with dissimilar HLA genotypes in order to increase the immunological diversity of their offspring. Instead of urban populations - where it is extremely difficult to disentangle social and biological drivers of mate choice - they analyze a small, endogamous community of Himba pastoralists in Namibia. This community includes both “purely romantic” unions and marriages arranged by families (and the anthropological record on Himba marital categories is considered a well-validated and reliable source of information). This elegant design gives the authors a rare opportunity to directly compare HLA similarity between “chosen” and “arranged” partnerships within a single culture while carefully controlling for genome-wide relatedness, using a relatively large dataset (about 250 partnerships). The results show NO significant differences in HLA diversity between arranged and chosen pairs. Likewise, the authors find no advantage of chosen unions in the predicted breadth of pathogen-peptide binding repertoires. Instead, they observe very frequent sharing of long HLA haplotypes - a pattern clearly consistent with recent episodes of fluctuating positive selection, which appears to be the main driver of HLA representational patterns in the population. In a global sense, there is good reason to believe that Himba genotype data can yield rich insights into selection in human populations, helping to separate biological evolution from cultural processes.",2025-12-09T09:57:47,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

No, we have no way of retrieving or calculating locations for each bat detection.

If we had continuous and sufficiently accurate GPS fixes tied to each bat detection that would enable the analysis you describe, which would be quite interesting.
