We will certainly take these into consideration in future versions of this paper. I can appreciate the value of qualifying/clarifying some of our results and interpretations. I am also very glad you were able to get the code working and that your assessment was generally consistent with ours. I certainly agree that a p-value just < 0.05 with a sample of > 1000 comes across weakly at first. But, given that we keep SpeciesID as a random effect in our main model, our sample size is essentially reduced to the number of species, which is only 16. If we run a simpler model asking whether a given participant is more likely than expected to pick the ""correct"" answer regardless of species, the p-value is much much smaller. This, along with your other points, are details we can definitely make clearer in the future.

A few years ago, I became interested in islet cell transdifferentiation, and read studies that used chromatin-modifying enzyme inhibitors to convert alpha cells into beta-like cells. I’m excited to see that you've taken this further by applying epigenome editing to activate insulin expression directly, this is a powerful and promising approach. Your results are intriguing and could be made even stronger with some restructuring of the narrative. For example, it would help to clarify the rationale for your cell model choices (e.g., in Fig. 3), and reviewers may be curious to see whether your system could also be applied to other islet cell types such as alpha or epsilon cells. If you’re preparing this for submission, I work with researchers to strengthen the clarity and strategy of their manuscripts, particularly those in molecular cell biology and chromatin engineering.",2025-07-14T03:01:24,karmellahaynes,Karmella Haynes,10.1101/2022.08.12.503816,Direct conversion of somatic cells into ‘insulin-producing-cells’ by user-defined multiplex-epigenetic-engineering vector (MEEV-β),"Raza Ali Naqvi, Afsar R Naqvi, Medha Priyadarshini",2022-08-13

It would also interesting to estimate from these data what fraction of injected tracer remains in the lymph node versus in the rest of the animal over time, for the various modes of delivery. As someone who is not used to looking at these types of biodistribution images, I wonder whether it would be possible to add schematics that illustrate the orientation of the animal in the various figures? And/or label the key features in the images (e.g. to point out the injection site, bladder, the various lymph nodes, etc).  This would help a lot to make it clear which lymph nodes were labeled at each time point. Thank you for sharing your work!

For each gene that is expressed in an input cell, we can assign all the genetic perturbation types that the model has been trained on. In our case they would be: CRISPR-a, CRISPR-i, CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-Cas13, ORF Overexpression, and no-perturbation. So for each gene, we have six options. Since we only bruteforce on single perturbations, we'll have 6 x (number of expressed genes) genetic perturbations, plus the 211 chemical perturbations. So if a cell has 1000 genes expressed, we'd have 6,211 ""counterfactuals"" to test, i.e., run inference on. That would be our search space. We tried a basic gradient-based method, where we froze all layers except the input layer, and tried to basically find an input that would maximize the given output (post-perturbation transcriptional profile). Unfortunately, this method didn't work immediately. I think this is a good area for future research. Yes, some other papers have referred to this as in-silico ""reverse perturbation"".

Yes, the chemical embedding head of the model is replaceable with any embedding model of your choice, but they should result in an embedding that has the expected dimensions by the rest of the model, namely the cross-attention module. Are you referring to this OGB leaderboard? https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/lsc/leaderboards/#pcqm4mv2 I selected Uni-Mol+ based on its performance on this specific leaderboard, and although there are some newer models that outperform it, Uni-Mol+ has a smaller parameter count than those. I cache the chemical embedding results since the weights of the chemical model are frozen, so no training is being done.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.16.648786v1#comment-6734761475,biorxivstage,0,"This is a very important study that expands the knowledge on the role of progesterone receptor (PGR)-positive subpopulation of bipotent mammary cells/MaSCs. Some of the terminology used in the paper is somewhat ambiguous, in particular ""basal population"". In the literature, basal is used both to refer to the bipotent/MaSC-like cells that reside in the basal layer and for myoepithelial cells and myoepithelial progenitors that are also basally located. Basal cells described in this manuscript are said to be EpCAM+CD49fhi, which is consistent with basally located bipotent/MaSC-like progenitors. Luminal progenitors also express both of these markers, but they would be EpCAMhiCD49f+ (or EpCAM+CD49flo - these cells in the paper are just labeled as luminal, not as luminal progenitors, although mature luminal cells are expected to be CD49f-). The findings of the study would be communicated in a much clearer way if ambiguous terms were made more specific (e.g. ""basal bipotent progenitors"" instead of ""basal cells"", and ""luminal progenitors"" or ""mature luminal cells"" instead of just ""luminal cells""). In one sentence, CD49 instead of CD49f is used, which should be corrected.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.21.595224v2#comment-6734743798,biorxivstage,1,"This paper examines the evolution of X chromosome dosage compensation in nematodes. There are several interesting findings. The condensin-mediated dosage compensation complex is shown to have evolved recently in the Caenorhabditis lineage. In addition, a different duplication of SMC-4 occurred in two Pristionchus species, suggesting that Pristionchus independently evolved a similar condensin-mediated mechanism of dosage compensation (“parallel evolution”). Caenorhabditis and Pristionchus share other signatures of condensin-mediated dosage compensation, namely X-specific topologically-associating domains (TADs) and enrichment of the H4K20me1 chromatin mark on the X chromosome. The data supporting these conclusions are strong and the underlying experiments are rigorous. Additional interesting observations are made regarding dosage compensation mechanisms in two other nematode lineages, Oscheius and Steinernema. Oscheius is found to lack X-specific TADs, but has enrichment of H4K20me1, while Steinernema lacks both X-specific TADs and H4K20me1 enrichment. These results suggest that condensin-mediated dosage compensation may have evolved in the presence of an existing mechanism that involves H4K20me1. Additionally, Oscheius is shown to have X chromosome dosage compensation, but in Steinernema, dosage compensation is found to be incomplete. Unlike the results for Caenorhabditis and Pristionchus, some of the data for Oscheius and Steinernema are not as clear-cut and thus, the support for some of the conclusions is not as strong. There are perhaps a few places where the caveats could be pointed out and the conclusions toned down, but for the most part, I think the authors are appropriately cautious in interpreting their data. Overall, this is an interesting study that raises further interesting questions about how dosage compensation mechanisms evolve and are constrained. I have only relatively minor comments. 1. TADs. Hi-C data shown in Fig 2B are used to infer whether X-chromosome TADs are present. The data are quite clear for P. pacificus (TADs), C. elegans (TADs), and O. tipulae (no TADs). C. remanei is also scored as having X-specific TADs, though the TAD features are less obvious. It is argued that this is because the C. remanei data come from mixed-stage and mixed-sex worms (published elsewhere), so features specific to female X chromosomes in somatic cells would be diluted out. This is a reasonable argument. Also, in Fig 2B, Steinernema hermaphroditum is inferred not to have X-specific TADs. But to my eye (admittedly untrained for Hi-C data), the S. hermaphroditum pattern looks very similar to C. remanei. And the S. hermaphroditum data (also published elsewhere) has the same caveat as C. remanei of coming from mixed-stage animals that makes the TAD features less obvious. Additionally, the S. hermaphroditum data were obtained using a different Hi-C method that is restriction enzyme-independent. So it is unclear how it is conclusively determined that C. remanei has TADs and S. hermaphroditum doesn’t, especially given that the data come from different labs using different methods. Further explanation of the criteria used to score these data and make these conclusions would be useful. 2. Dosage compensation. Data show that all species analyzed except Steinernema carpocapsae have clear dosage compensation. S. carcocapsae data are somewhat less clear. Fig 4E shows that for two X-linked scaffolds, expression in females is higher than males, indicating a lack of complete dosage compensation. However, the difference is less than two-fold, suggesting that there is some dosage compensation. Also, of the two-scaffolds, the difference is only statistically significant for one of the two (Fig S11), even though both are X-linked, weakening the conclusion that this species lacks dosage compensation. Is it possible that the lack of full dosage compensation could be due to contamination of the data with more germline expressed genes? 3. The authors suggest the interesting possibility that the lack of complete dosage-compensation in Steinernema may be due to a couple of autosome to sex chromosome fusions in this species. In this case, one might expect full dosage compensation in some parts of the chromosome, and no dosage compensation in others. Can the data be analyzed to determine if dosage compensation varies in different regions of the Steinernema X chromosome, especially corresponding to different nigon elements? Or is there partial dosage compensation all along the X? 4. H4K20me1. Based on the data in Fig 5, the authors conclude that like C. elegans, P. pacificus and O. tipulae have H4K20me1 enrichment on the X chromosome, but S. hermaphroditum does not. The data for C. elegans and S. hermaphroditum are quite clear. However, there appears to be less H4K20me1 enrichment in P. pacificus and O. tipulae in the chromosome-wide data shown in Fig 5A. In both these species, there appears to be a higher level of H4K20me1 on the representative autosome, and to my eye, O. tipulae does not even show enrichment on the X. Is it possible to quantify levels of enrichment between species on autosomes and the X? It would be nice to see the ChIP-Seq tracks for all autosomes in a supplemental figure, not just the single representative autosomes shown in Fig 5A. To their credit, the authors recognize that X enrichment of H4K20me1 is weaker in O. tipulae and do statistics to back up their claim, but the statistics seem to be done only on H4K20me1 enrichment in gene bodies. Is there a difference between enrichment on the whole chromosome versus gene bodies in O. tipulae? 5. In the discussion, the authors suggest based on parsimony that dosage compensation was present in the common ancestor of the different nematode groups, but lost in the lineage leading to Steinernema. Though I agree this is the most likely scenario, isn’t it equally parsimonious to say that the common ancestor lacked dosage compensation, but that it evolved separately in Brugia (i.e. two gains of dosage compensation in nematodes instead of one gain and one loss)? So should it be stated that the authors’ model is the most parsimonious?

Without data on how many times each test was repeated, it is not possible to determine whether the results are consistent or could be due to chance. Moreover, the absence of statistical analysis reinforces this weakness, as there are no other indicators provided to assess data variability. There are also areas for improvement in the results section. There is inadequate numbering of tables and inconsistencies between the tabulated content and what is described in the text. For example, zones of inhibition are mentioned for certain extracts that are not accurately reflected in the tables, leading to confusion. The descriptions of the results are unclear and, in some cases, redundant, lacking an interpretive analysis that would help in understanding the findings. The figures include unclear captions, and there is reuse of images without any apparent differentiation. Likewise, it is not evident that they meet the technical standards required for publication, which affects the visual quality and transparency of the work. Given that the inhibition halo is the main indicator of antimicrobial activity, greater care is expected in its graphical documentation. Additionally, some of the content presented in the results, such as the morphological description of the bacteria and the general chemical profile of the plants, should be located in the introduction as part of the theoretical framework. This misplacement of content affects the structure of the manuscript and makes it difficult to identify the original findings of the study.

In addition, histological validation of recovery reinforces the robustness of the model. However, it induces chemical damage rather than mimicking the pathophysiology of human ulcerative colitis (autoimmune), so it does not fully capture the immunological complexity in humans. Although the study used 23 mice for the SHARE-seq experiments, it would be advisable to increase the number of animals and perform more replicates, as the response to DSS damage and the recovery process may vary between individuals. This may affect the proportion of stem cells with high accessibility to AP-1 sites. As this subpopulation represents only 9%, a larger sample helps to confirm that this phenomenon is not due to chance or differences between a few individuals. Regarding the temporality of genetic memory, epigenetic marks show persistence up to 21–22 days post-colitis, but longer periods are not explored. Longer-term studies would help define the actual duration of memory and its potential reversibility, which would be crucial for assessing clinical relevance. The recommendation would be to add this as a section on limitations. In terms of structure, the preprint is clearly and logically organized. It begins with a solid introduction that contextualizes the relationship between inflammation and cancer. Some experimental results related to the SHARE-TRACE technique and its validation are intermingled with the main biological findings, which may make it difficult for readers who are not experts in molecular biology or epigenomics to understand.

It is particularly valuable due to its scalability and the use of already available public data. However, its implementation presents methodological and structural limitations that must be urgently addressed to ensure robust and applicable results. The exclusive reliance on GenBank introduces clear geographic and taxonomic biases, as regions such as Eastern and Northern Europe are underrepresented, as well as ecologically dominant families like Asteraceae and Rosaceae. This unequal coverage can distort the patterns of genetic diversity presented, affecting the representativeness of the index. Moreover, reducing genetic diversity to a single metric π significantly limits the analysis, excluding key aspects such as heterozygosity, genetic differentiation, and population structure, which are fundamental to assessing genetic health and connectivity. Another important issue is that the GDI assigns equal weight to all species, without distinguishing those that are rare, functionally important, or endangered. This may lead to a biased prioritization that favors regions with more available data rather than those with greater conservation urgency. Additionally, the study does not present a clear proposal for how to integrate the GDI into public policies, restoration plans, or protected area systems, nor does it consider current threats such as land-use change or habitat loss. Therefore, we recommend complementing GenBank with other genetic databases such as EMBL, BOLD, or GBIF; incorporating additional metrics that better reflect actual genetic diversity; establishing ecological weighting criteria among species; and linking the index’s results with real-world conservation scenarios and decision-making. With these adjustments, the GDI could become not only a methodologically robust tool, but also a practical, equitable, and useful instrument for the global conservation of genetic biodiversity.",2025-07-08T17:07:35,dannyyupa,Danny Yupa,10.1101/2025.06.03.657643,Unlocking the Forgotten Dimension of Biodiversity: A Scalable Genetic Diversity Index for Multi-Species Analysis,"Piyal Karunarathne, Marvin Klümpen, Laura E.

For example, only a few danger signals were used, which does not represent all possible predators for all prey species. Ungulate mammals do not sense fear or risk towards owl sounds or fox urine, as these are not their predators par excellence. At this point, the number and variability of risk signals, such as bear urine or urine from a larger predator, could be expanded. In addition, it was done in a single region, so the results cannot be automatically applied to other areas such as rainforests or agricultural areas. Another point of improvement is the low detectability of some species (such as squirrel or dormouse) limits the statistical power of certain models. In future studies it would be beneficial to expand the sampling effort or to complement with other techniques such as environmental genomics (feces, fur). The use of baits (canned sardines) to attract animals to the chambers is mentioned. This type of attractant may artificially increase the frequency of visits and modify spatial patterns of movement, which would generate a bias in the estimates of activity and detection, thus compromising the validity of inferences about spontaneous behaviors related to risk perception. Despite this, the article is a great contribution, because it shows that fear changes the lives of animals even without direct contact with a predator, which is important to improve how we protect wildlife and manage ecosystems.

The authors address this gap in the literature by compiling one of the most impressive multi-omic profiles of T cells within any neurodegenerative disease to date. Assays performed on Cingulate Cortex and Substantia Nigra of PD patients include: targeted sequencing methods to determine clonal expansion, single nuclei RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, predictive algorithms to determine interactions between T cells other cells in their respective regions, and immunohistochemistry. Of note, the authors found that tissue resident memory (TRM) phenotypes were present within these PD-T cells. The findings in this paper relating to T cells are robust and well supported, however several claims concerning astrocyte regional diversity lack appropriate evidence. Overall, the study design(s) make the most of a rare cell type and these data appear to be a rich resource to those studying glial dysfunction in PD. Major concerns: 1.	The study focuses on T cells, however adds several analyses investigating their astrocytes alone or T cell-astrocyte interaction. How many of these conclusions comes from analyses done in paired samples? a.	How do conclusions drawn from unpaired samples across region affect the authors’ conclusions? b.	What are the sources of variability between regions that may also explain the lack of T cells in the cingulate cortex? Where these measures taken into account in any astrocyte analysis (i.e. covarying braak, sex, etc in astrocyte DEG?) 2.	scHPF analysis to describe factors in this dataset appears to be convincing as factor 5 overlapped with TRM gene sets and the authors validated via IHC that T cells in the PD brain expressed TRM marker CD103. However based on figure 2i, it appears that factor 5 is highest in Oligodendrocytes, followed by Astrocytes, then T cells. Could the authors further describe how scHPF T-Cells factors were selected in 2k and whether they make up the majority of this factor set? 3.	Spatial deconvolution with the authors’ new SCC equation appears to give good evidence that T cells are in proximity to oligodendrocytes, confirming what was observed with T cell counts in white matter. It is unclear which data support the claim “we found high significance in the spatial relationship between T-cells and T-cell disease factor in PD, and lack of significance in controls”. It does not appear to be in Fig 7 where I would expect it. Minor concerns/comments: •	Possible typo pg 10: are the sections for IHC 7 millimeters (mm) thick? Or 7 micrometers thick? •	“Nuclei that did not conform to cell types were presumed to be doublets or artifactual noise and removed.” Since no formal doublet detection or ambient RNA correction was done, could the authors specify how many nuclei were removed in this fashion or markers that were used to determine lack of conformation? •	Lack of neuronal diversity in the clustering performed on CC initially seemed unexpected, however the authors do I nice job in the supplemental figures. Could the authors similarly report T cell markers used to determine cell state? And possibly counts per donor?

However, the article’s interpretation, contextual framing, and supporting evidence for these claims raise several scientific and methodological concerns. The authors posit an apparent paradox, specifically, that low aqueous Se concentrations and elevated fish muscle Se concentrations. This is presented as an alarming ecological signal, and supports the thesis that the Se in these fish has accumulated over many years despite low aqueous concentrations. The assumption here is that Se has potentially cycled within the food web; however, a more fulsome historical understanding of this system is required to make this link. Specifically, were aqueous Se concentrations historically higher, and then declined more recently? If this were the case, comparing current water Se concentrations to current fish tissue concentrations is an “apples vs oranges” scenario. While elevated tissue Se in fish certainly warrants further investigation (i.e., are populations and/or fish health being impacted?), this ‘paradox’ is actually not inherently unusual. Selenium bioaccumulates, particularly in food webs involving algae, invertebrates and fish/birds, and tissue concentrations can remain elevated for years after aqueous exposures have declined, particularly in lentic waters with longer residence times. Without time-resolved aqueous and tissue Se data, it is at best speculative to interpret these findings as alarming, or even ecologically significant. The article does not present any data or evidence of historical Se concentrations in water or biota to support its claims of historical or ongoing accumulation. The article presents new Se fish tissue data, but fails to reference any previous monitoring efforts in Crowsnest Lake or nearby waterbodies. Consequently, one cannot assess trends in Se (i.e., whether concentrations are increasing, stable, or anomalous). This is significant, since it would need to be demonstrated that high concentrations had been sustained in order for Se to bioaccumulate in aquatic biota tissues. Moreover, there is no attempt to address the mobility patterns of the fish species sampled, which is a significant omission, given the authors’ assertion that the Se in the system originated from the two decommissioned mines2. For example, species like brown trout and mountain whitefish may use tributaries for spawning or feeding, potentially exposing them to elevated Se concentrations outside the lake. If this is the case, then the lake itself may not have been the primary source of Se accumulation. Without tools like radiotelemetry, tagging, or isotopic forensics, the source attribution to Crowsnest Lake or Tent Mountain is speculative. The authors themselves acknowledge that the fish populations reported on in the paper (i.e., brown trout, lake trout, and mountain whitefish) in Crowsnest Lake are “self-sustaining”; they then suggest that current tissue Se concentrations may lead to a “population collapse” or “reproductive failure”. This contradiction is neither reconciled nor supported with data on recruitment, deformities, or reproductive metrics. The reference to such a collapse is not only unsupported, but actually conflicts with their own admission of population persistence. The article further suggests that Whirling Disease and Se toxicity could have overlapping symptoms, possibly confounding diagnoses. This suggestion is completely speculative and unsubstantiated. No peer-reviewed evidence to-date links Se-induced pathologies in fish to the clinical signs of Myxobolus cerebralis infection (the cause of Whirling Disease). A central assumption of the paper is that Se is leaching into the lake from historical waste rock from the closed Tent Mountain mine. However, the authors provide no chemical fingerprinting, hydrological modeling, or sediment Se profiles to demonstrate a link. As such, the attribution again remains speculative and circumstantial. Phrases such as “devastating consequences,” “complete reproductive failure,” and “acute threat” are used throughout the paper without any corresponding ecological data. These statements are alarmist and do not reflect the chronic, sub-lethal, nature of Se toxicity in aquatic ecosystems; it is well known that Se is not acutely toxic at environmental concentrations and does not cause sudden population collapses in the absence of sustained exposure and bioaccumulation. Figure 2 compares Se concentrations across fish species and regions, but does not control for species-specific bioaccumulation potential, life stage, or habitat use. Comparing lake trout to other fish in other regions is both inappropriate and misleading. Species-specific comparisons are more relevant, and a consideration of whether the fish inhabit lentic vs lotic systems would make the comparison more valid and informative. Furthermore, no effort is made to explain the geological and ecological differences among the geographically-diverse reference sites in comparison to Crowsnest Lake. While the authors report Se concentrations in fish tissue, key details on analytical methods, quality control, and lab accreditation are not provided in the article. Without such information, confidence in the analytical results is difficult to evaluate fully. This is especially important in the case of Se, due to its low environmental concentrations and the complexity of accurately measuring low concentrations. As suggested, and given the significant implications of these data, independent verification or confirmation through expert review is highly recommended. It should be noted that the article comprises a couple of important inaccuracies, specifically: •	the article refers to a CCME sediment Se guideline of 2 µg/g, which does not exist; Canada has not adopted sediment guidelines for Se. Additionally, the cited whole-body fish tissue guideline of 6.7 µg/g appears to be based on the ECCC Federal Environmental Quality Guideline (FEQG), and is not a CCME guideline. The FEQG applies specifically to egg/ovary Se (14.7 µg/g) and muscle Se only as a screening value. Mis-stating the origin and intent of these values is a significant error that undermines the scientific rigor of the article; and, •	the article cites the 93% decline in Westslope Cutthroat Trout in the Fording River, but fail to cite the detailed, peer-reviewed Investigation of Cause (IOC) study, which attributed the decline to climatic conditions and not selenium toxicity. •	the article incorrectly implies that a $60 million fine was due to this decline. That fine, in fact, stemmed from broader non-compliance issues from 2012 – long before that decline occurred - and not a direct attribution to the population drop. Summary While it is understandable that elevated Se in fish tissue relative to low water concentrations raises a concern, the information provided in this paper fails to establish causality, provide historical or trophic context, or rigorously support its conclusions. The speculative connections to Tent Mountain, Whirling Disease, and catastrophic ecological effects are not supported by specific and relevant evidence. Misuse of terminology, misattribution of guideline values, and emotionally-charged language further erodes its credibility. A study of this type initially requires the clear identification and articulation of key research hypotheses (e.g., “is the elevated Se in fish tissue mine-related?”; “how is Se cycled in Crowsnest Lake”), and then determine what data/information are required to address those hypotheses. A multi-disciplinary, scientifically-defensible approach integrating fish movement, food web monitoring, sediment and water Se speciation, and reproductive success metrics, is essential to developing and reporting on scientifically-defensible conclusions.",2025-07-03T00:51:23,,GUY GILRON,10.1101/2025.05.22.655156,Fish remain high in selenium long after mountaintop coal mines close,"Colin A.

Specifically, the team utilizes transmission mode MALDI followed by cold plasma ionization source (SICRIT) with analytes then being analyzed in a timsTOF Pro. The work was able to achieve subcellular MSI which they  showed across a variety of tissues and cells to highlight their application. Furthermore, they fortuitously discovered that pre-staining with cresyl violet enhanced ionization of nucleotides and helped facilitate subcellular imaging. Overall this paper provided excellent figures with exciting data, was highly rigorous in the reporting of the lipid species and nomenclature used, and with the instrumental design and assessment of the staining impact on the resulting images. We also enjoyed that this could provide staining and MSI on the same tissue rather than having to take serial sections; this is a really exciting aspect of this work. Below please find critiques for the authors considerations. 1. The comparison between pre and post CV staining was striking. Perhaps a little more discussion here could be helpful, it seems like in addition to the sample preparation creating the cavitations, do the authors posit that CV itself might be acting as a matrix as well to help facilitate ionization? Would other stains have a similar effect? 2. Our understanding of this instrument is that this is still fundamentally MALDI-2 like, in that the SICRIT is acting as a secondary ionization source, can the authors perhaps confirm this or make it more clear in the writing, that both neutral and ions are created during the transmission mode and further ions are created by the SICRIT. If this is not what is happening, then perhaps the writing could be adjusted. 3. For all MSI figures, it would be helpful to include the SMART ( https://doi.org/10.1002/jms.4904) reporting standards in the figures both main text and SI are encouraged to increase the transparency of the experiments. One thing we discussed was the time these experiments might take for the areas and the spatial resolutions achieved. 4. One thing that was unclear, is the intersection of how the cold plasma vs the more traditional MALDI-2 would drive the specifics for ionization of the nucleotides and lipids. Specifically could the CV be compatible with normal MALDI-2? We appreciate that the same spatial resolutions would not be achieved but it would be interesting to really isolate how the different changes really impact the subsequent detection of analytes to better understand how to optimize the system or pick the system for different biomolecules in the future. 5. Figure 4D doesn’t seem to help aid in the excitement of this methodology, specifically the microscopy doesn’t match the ion images. Or did the authors expect that only one cell line would be different compared to the other three? Could they better comment on some of the biology maybe if this what they expected?Figure 4C. Was the point to demonstrate colocalization of the dyes with the lipids? It could be helpful to highlight why the data might be meaningful and address the outstanding biological challenges. Figure4 B, C, D weren’t in order for increasing spatial resolution. 6. Can the authors comment on why only positive mode was done for the lipid analysis? Can this set up do negative mode? It might be helpful to comment on to better understand the rationale. 7. Why was 6 ppm vs 5 ppm for the lipid annotations? Typically for Organic Chemistry or Natural Products we utilize 5 ppm for HRMS. 8. Figure 3 this is very cool - is this known that Adenosine has a punctate pattern? The significance of the findings was not discussed, if this is a new biological observation that would be helpful to highlight this more so that the importance of subcellular metabolomics is really needed. Highlighting the significance of the findings would help bolster the future applications.",2025-07-01T20:31:41,disqus_nXqTRGyBsq,Laura Sanchez,10.1101/2025.05.13.653655,Subcellular mass spectrometry imaging of lipids and nucleotides using transmission geometry ambient laser desorption and plasma ionisation,"Reuben S.E.

We commend this work for establishing three key advances: The authors conclusively demonstrate that MIA-induced Treg deficiency and epigenetic dysregulation—drives ASD-like phenotypes. Crucially, adoptive transfer of healthy Tregs postnatally rescues social deficits and repetitive behaviors in offspring. This aligns with our previous findings that MIA offspring exhibit peripheral Th1/Th17 skewing (Zhipeng Xu et al. Nat Neurosci 2021), but extends the paradigm by proving offspring Tregs are autonomous therapeutic targets. The identification of sustained Foxp3 demethylation in offspring Tregs reveals a transgenerational immune imprinting mechanism. This explains the longevity of neurodevelopmental deficits and offers a postnatal intervention window—complementing our prenatal maternal Treg-focused strategy (Chunxiang Shen et al. Cell Rep 2024). While our previous work showed MIA disrupts placental Treg/ macrophage balance (via SR-A-dependent Sjp90α intervention), this preprint demonstrates how placental inflammation permanently programs offspring immunity. The data bridge in utero insults to postnatal neuropathology, forming a neuroimmunological continuum. This work redefines ASD as a neuroimmunological continuum spanning generations. By validating offspring Treg deficiency as a central pathological mechanism, it expands therapeutic opportunities beyond prenatal windows. We advocate integrated maternal-offspring strategies to disrupt this intergenerational cycle.",2025-07-01T15:19:27,disqus_U7b1J5Bi3a,徐志鹏(zhipengxu),10.1101/2025.01.06.631430,Maternal immune activation imprints a regulatory T cell deficiency in offspring that drives an autism-like phenotype,"Pierre Ellul, Gwladys Fourcade, Vanessa Mhanna, Nicolas Coatnoan, Susana Bodula, Danielle Seilhean, Laura Mouton, Gwendolyn Marguerit, Richard Delorme, Tian Mi, Ben Youngblood, Michelle Rosenzwajg, Nicolas Tchitchek, David Klatzmann",2025-01-08

Personally I'd have interpreted these results differently at times, but I understand the need to produce compelling narratives... For example, if you put the reaction time difference (20 ms) in context, you could have a different interpretation of relevance. One such context is the limits of human perception, which is about 5 ms for very sort stimuli, and scales with stimuli over about 250 ms. Another point up for discussion is effect sizes (rather than 'significance'). Normally if I do an analysis with >1000 samples/participants, and I get a p value of 0.048, that means the effect size is so small that even if it's not random, it's an extremely small effect size (I'm not quite as experienced with GLMMs, so I lack a bit of intuition here). Personally I would scramble the participant results across stimuli and see what the p-value turns out to be, just to be sure that it's not just overfitting (as far I can see, there's quite a few parameters in the model). I've definitely seen cases where this level of 'significance' can be generated by better than 1 in 20 odds, and I assume that this is related to overfitting and hidden non-randomness in any randomly-generated data. Whether it's still significant or not, I'd prefer to see effect sizes discussed in some sort of meaningful way. Like, how many times would I have the same preferences as another animal when selecting stimuli? Perhaps that's the horizontal bar with whiskers in Fig. 1A? It'd be nice to know the number (e.g. 55%?). I'd also be interested to see a graph where the same (or equivalent) measure of agreement was plotted for human-human agreement, animal-animal agreement, and human-animal agreement. And I don't think this statement is properly qualified, ""Our global survey discovered that humans share acoustic preferences with other animals, spanning insects, frogs, birds, and non-human mammals."" Technically you showed a group-level effect, which says nothing about the individual species. So one might wrongly take away from your statement that humans share acoustic preferences with each of these animals. When in actuality, it could be that a few species have a strong enough effect to bring up the average, and other species may share no acoustic preferences. Still, cool paper. But I would be open to the possibility that the results are actually random, and perhaps not try to make such a strong claim with effects that are borderline random.",2025-06-30T15:27:28,disqus_kHaiH8cKyG,John McBride,10.1101/2025.06.26.661759,Humans share acoustic preferences with other animals,"Logan S James, Sarah C Woolley, Jon T Sakata, Courtney B Hilton, Michael J Ryan, Samuel A Mehr",2025-06-27

Recently, the Koopman formalism has been used to convert the nonlinear generative model into an equivalent linear system with the aid of an infinite-dimensional operator [2], facilitating the design of optimal control inputs [3]. However, the author believes that any control input (including an optimal one) can only be designed if the nonlinear generative model is controllable. If the nonlinear generative model is controllable, then its equivalent linear system representation is also controllable. We now state some expressions of accessibility for nonlinear discrete-time systems, as proposed in [4,5,6]. \textbf{Theorem 1:} Consider a nonlinear discrete-time system of the form \begin{align} z(t+1)=f(z(t),u(t)),\,\,\forall\,\, z(t)\in\mathbb{Z}, u(t)\in\mathbb{U} \label{eq1} \end{align} The state--set $\mathbb{Z}$ is a connected manifold of dimension $n$ and $\mathbb{U}\subset \text{clos}\,\,\text{int}\,\,\mathbb{U}$ which is also connected in nature. If the system given by Eq. (\ref{eq1}) is analytic then the following properties hold true \begin{itemize} \item The system is \textit{forward} accessible if and only if \begin{equation} \text{dim}\,\,\mathcal{L}^{+}(z)=n \end{equation} \item The system is \textit{backward} accessible if and only if \begin{equation} \text{dim}\,\,\mathcal{L}^{-}(z)=n \end{equation} \item The system is \textit{transitive} if and only if \begin{equation} \text{dim}\,\,\mathcal{L}(z)=n \end{equation} \end{itemize} For further details on how to calculate the Lie derivatives, please see [4]. \textbf{Remarks:} The paper cited in [3] for designing optimal control input through the lens of Koopman operator theory is [7], which assumes that the original nonlinear system is controllable. If the assumption is true, then it is always possible to reach from any initial state to any final state under the influence of a finite control input within a finite amount of time. If some states are unreachable, due to physical constraints on the control input as claimed in [3], then the original assumption that the nonlinear system is controllable is not true, and the design procedure proposed is not valid. \vspace{5mm} Now, if the nonlinear system is not controllable, then we need to look in the direction of reachability. Reachability analysis aims to determine all possible future states that a system can attain, starting from uncertain initial conditions and incorporating any system uncertainties. The reachability analysis of linear systems and nonlinear continuous systems for which dynamics is known has received a great deal of attention in the literature [8]. Recently, the concept of matrix measures has been extended to systems on time scales (which includes systems on continuous, discrete or hybrid systems) [9]. Thus, the reachability analysis of discrete--time systems can be proved using its corresponding matrix measures. As an alternative approach, one can look in the direction of constrained zonotypes which has been proposed to perform reachability analysis of nonlinear discrete--time systems [10].

They show using both DSF and ITC how the thermal stability of ancestral reconstructed TF’s is lost while the thermodynamic binding components gradually switch for different carbon substrates from an entropic to enthalpic binding mode. The authors follow up their thermodynamic experiments with structural studies of the crystallized ancestral TF’s with their respective substrates bound to provide a structural basis for their thermodynamic observations. Their structural analysis suggests two major sources for the thermodynamic binding modes: first, the substrate binding site evolved away from predominantly bulky hydrophobic residues in the most distant ancestor to smaller polar residues which resulted in a change in ligand binding towards forming specific hydrogen bonds both with the TF directly but also through an extensive water network (enthalpic component). Second, the authors compared the most distantly related TF’s to illustrate the evolution of greater protein stability as illustrated by the greater order exhibited by Anc4, particularly in a loop region that is distal to the binding site. Further, they also show that ligand binding to Anc1 does not induce a greater degree of order compared to the apo protein which they propose represents a redistribution of entropy away from the ligand binding site. Major points Point 1. The authors propose that Anc1 has a spatial redistribution of entropy away from the ligand binding site to the distal loops to compensate for the loss of conformational entropy upon binding. Can they test this hypothesis by truncating or stabilizing (by point mutation) the loops? Despite a cooler earth at present, there are still organisms that live at hot temperatures. Do the extent orthologues in these organisms show entropically driven binding? Do the ancestors reported in this function as transcription factors at higher temperatures? Can the authors propose an experiment to test this? It’s interesting that Anc1 is the most thermally stable of the TF’s (based on the hypothesized relationship between earth temperature and protein thermal stability) yet the structure suggests it’s the most disordered compared to Anc4. Can the authors comment on how this fits within their proposed model? Point 2. The possibility that ancestral reconstruction artificially stabilizes proteins has been acknowledged in the literature (e.g. PMID 27413048). Are the authors concerned that the changes in stability observed in their work might be due to the stabilizing effect of consensus mutations? Point 3. The authors focus on the LBD of the LGF family for structural studies and point out that Anc1 (the most distant ancestor) exhibits a greater level of disorder compared to the most recent ancestor Anc4. Is this level of disorder also expected to occur in the DNA binding domain or is it disorder unique to the LBD? In other words, does evolution only act on one domain of this family or are there correlated changes to the DBD as well (allosteric mechanism)? Point 4. It’s interesting that D-fucose binding was largely lost by Anc2 (or not tested?), can the authors provide a structural reason for that similar to their analysis with Anc4? Further, with respect to Figure 4 can authors show (perhaps just an AlphaFold prediction) what the composition of the substrate binding site looks like between each ancestor? Was there a sudden change between Anc1 and Anc2 in composition or was it more gradual (also given the D-fucose binding is almost lost between Anc1 and Anc2 - again was that actually tested)? Point 5. “It should be noted that he apo and ᴅ-fucose-bound ΔAnc1 structures were obtain from crystals from same crystal screening drop i.e., the observed differences are not due to differences in crystallization conditions”. Was this a co-crystallization experiment where two crystals were looped from a single drop - one crystal led to a structure with fucose bound and the other was apo? Crystals with different symmetry (and different crystal packing) can grow in the same drop from identical conditions. The listed space groups in Supplementary Table 2 indicated that the space group was different for the apo and fucose-bound Anc1. Is there concern that the conformational change observed between holo and apo-protein is influenced by the differences in crystal packing? The cell dimensions are similar, can the authors check that the data indexing is consistent? Point 6. The authors point out that LacI is a functional homodimer in Figure 1 but do not distinguish whether they are investigating the homodimer or monomeric form in subsequent experiments. It would be helpful to clarify which oligomeric state they are investigating in their experiments (DSF, ITC, etc.). See minor point 3. Point 7. D-fucose is smaller and more hydrophobic than BMDG/lactose. It follows that a protein’s binding pocket that is smaller and more hydrophobic (e.g. better packed) will favor D-fucose binding. Given that core packing is a well-established mechanism of protein stabilization (e.g. PMID 27425410), how do the authors think about whether this reflects well established principles in molecular recognition and protein stability vs novel mechanistic insight specific to sugar recognition evolution? Minor points Point 1. Check the Figure 4 legend matches the subpanel letters. E.g. panel “a” shows BMDG not D-fucose. Point 2. IPTG is a synthetic analogue of allolactose and is unlikely to be encountered by evolution in the context of this work. Was this included because it was in the initial carbon source panel? Point 3. Supplementary Figure 6. Only Anc3 and Anc4 appear to have a well defined transition in the CD melt curves. Are the fits to a sigmoidal curve meaningful for the other curves? How were the uncertainties calculated for these fits? Perhaps quote confidence intervals instead of SEM? Point 4. “ᴅ-fucose retains degrees of freedom in the Anc1 binding pocket, contrary to the idea that ligands lose their conformational entropy on binding” How was “degrees of freedom” assessed in this case? Were multiple conformations observed in the electron density maps? Point 5. Ensemble refinement (PMID 23251785) was used to assess protein disorder, however, it is not mentioned in the results text. The Rfree values for the input models to Supplementary Table 5 to help comparison. The Rfree values were up to 5% worse for the ensembles compared to refinement of a single structure (e.g. 21.21 vs 26.21 for the Anc1 glycerol structure). This suggests that the ensemble is worse than a single model. The authors should justify the inclusion of these results. Point 6. The lac operon regulates genes associated with the metabolism of lactose. What did the fuc operon regulate? (Perhaps the genes are hinted at in gray text in Figure 1b?) Point 7. “These findings are suggestive of an evolutionary transition from binding of lactose/BMDG to ᴅ-fucose.” The reverse, right? D-fucose in ancestor, Lactose in extant? Point 8. Figure 2d could be improved by adding the results from all sugars tested with each ancestor. Reviewed by CJ San Felipe, Galen J. Correy & James S.

It's too bad the animals were sacrificed so early because you missed the most important mechanism of harm which is the T-cell attacks. All adverse reactions are immune-mediated on concentrated foci on the endothelium. Once SP production is started, SP peptides are presented on the MHCs for self-monitoring. It typically takes 2-3 days for T-cell specialization after the first injection in a naive individual. I am not sure how fast the boluses were injected. Were they infused slowly over a few minutes? or were they instantaneous bolus? Was that consistent across all pigs? PEG impedes transfection of endothelial cells at first.  As soon as PEG is eroded, typically after the passage in the lungs or sometimes earlier, LNPs are activated.  This gives a little time for dilution to take place. Boluses deliver concentrated transfection across the lungs, the heart chambers, the aorta, the large arteries, and onto the organs' capillaries, with increasing activation, and decreasing concentration. Once T-cells are maturated, they would trigger massive T-cell attacks and literally strip the endothelial layer.  Given your methodology, within a few days, all the pigs injected in IV would have died. Some of the anaphylaxis, necrosis must have been triggered either by LNP clogging once the PEG eroded some capillaries, and creating ischemia, or by by endothelial stress-induced apoptosis, triggered coagulation cascades (hence the thrombocytopenia). It's pretty clear from the IM injections that they all go systemic.  The reason they go systemic is because the needle cuts through vessels, and the Law of pressure gradient stipulates that the dose will inevitably migrate to the point of least pressure i.e. the severed vessels, which won't be able to coagulate until the excess pressure in the muscle evens out.",2025-06-22T14:20:43,marcgirardot,Marc Girardot,10.1101/2025.06.07.658379,Acute anaphylactic and multiorgan inflammatory effects of Comirnaty in pigs: evidence of spike protein mRNA transfection and paralleling inflammatory cytokine upregulation,"László Dézsi, Gábor Kökény, Gábor Szénási, Csaba Révész, Tamás Mészáros, Bálint A.

I have a comment on the methodology that, in my opinion, might affect your results. In previous studies, it has been shown that finger interdependence tends to increase during isometric steady-state force production tasks (e.g., Hirose et al., 2020; Abolins et al., 2020, 2023). In your analysis, the time window used to calculate forces appears to vary from trial to trial. This variability may affect the assessment of interdependence and related force measures. Have you examined whether finger interdependence changes over time in your data? I believe this would be an important point to consider when interpreting your findings.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.638932v1#comment-6721569675,biorxivstage,1,"Dear authors, as part of a group activity in our lab we discussed your very interesting manuscript with the goal of reviewing it as well as improving our reviewing skills. The below review is the result of this exercise and reflects thoughts and comments of several people. We hope this helps you with your way forward to publish the paper in a good journal. Summary, strengths and limitations of the paper The manuscript by Lee et al. investigates the mechanisms behind lysosomal damage in CLN4, a form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis caused by dominant mutations in the DNAJC5 gene. The authors demonstrate that CLN4-associated DNAJC5 mutants aggregate on lysosomal membranes, leading to membrane disruption and severe lysosomal damage in neurons derived from human iPSCs and in a Drosophila disease model. In non-neuronal cells, a protective ubiquitin-dependent microautophagy pathway is activated, helping degrade these toxic aggregates and preventing lysotoxicity. Through CRISPR screens, the ubiquitin ligase CHIP (STUB1) was identified as a critical regulator of this pathway. CHIP facilitates the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of CLN4 aggregates, thus preserving lysosomal membrane integrity and preventing the lysosomal-driven cell toxicity. Importantly, overexpression of CHIP in CLN4 mutant neurons and flies restores lysosomal function, reduces lipofuscin accumulation, and rescues neurodegeneration, highlighting CHIP as a potential therapeutic target for CLN4 and, potentially, other lysosome-related neurodegenerative diseases. A strength of this study is its comprehensive mechanistic investigation into CLN4 disease, identifying lysosomal membrane damage as a key pathological feature and clarifying the still open question about how DNAJC5 aggregates cause neurodegeneration. In addition, the identification of the ubiquitin ligase CHIP as a key regulator of a protective microautophagy pathway represents a key discovery. CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of DNAJC5 aggregates enables their lysosomal degradation, effectively preserving lysosomal integrity. These findings are of important translational relevance, since CHIP overexpression restored lysosomal function and reduced neurodegeneration in both human neurons and flies, highlighting a promising therapeutic application. However, the study also displays some limitations. While the neuron-specific vulnerability to CLN4 aggregates is a central focus, the mechanistic basis for this selective sensitivity remains only partially explained. Additionally, the therapeutic relevance of CHIP modulation is based on genetic overexpression, which, while illustrative, does not yet translate to practical interventions such as small molecules or gene therapy strategies. The broad role of CHIP in cellular protein quality control also raises questions about potential off-target effects of systemic modulation. Despite these challenges, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field by establishing a mechanistic link between lysosomal membrane damage and CLN4 pathology and identifying CHIP-mediated microautophagy as a potential neuroprotective pathway. Major Comments 1.	In Figure 1A, why do monomeric DNAJC5 levels change in the mutants? L116ΔHT seems to have comparable levels to WT, which is not the case for the other heterozygous mutant nor for the homozygous of the same mutation. Are the overall DNAJC5 levels changed in the different lines? Maybe testing by qPCR or checking the fully solubilized protein by WB can be options. 2.	In Figure 1D, can the authors prove that the loss of lysotracker signal in day16 neurons is not simply because these cells are dying? Can they stain cells with calcein-AM as well? 3.	In Figure 1L, why do they not find CHIP in the proteome? Based on figure 5A, they should find a difference in its levels between WT and L116Δ HM. Do they check the proteome at a timepoint that is too early, or are CHIP levels overall too low to pick up changes? Minor comment: in the text, they define a log fold change cut-off of 1.5. Please illustrate this in figure 1L. 4.	In Extended Data Figure 2E, where does the HMW form of DNAJC5 fractionate? And does the organelles fraction change in mutants? It would be of help to see the fractionation of the mutant too, showing also the HMW DNAJC5. This will also help to understand why the authors see the downregulation of DNAJC5 in mutants in mass spec (Figure 1L). 5.	The authors show that the lysotracker phenotype in mutants is likely not linked to V-ATPase dysfunction. However, it is not fully clear what is happening to V-ATPase. In Extended Data Figure 3A, the WB shows a decrease in the interaction between mutants FLAG-DNAJC5 and membrane-bound ATP6V1G2. What is the authors’ hypothesis of this phenotype? 6.	In Figure 3, the authors conclude that ubiquitin, HGS and DNAJC5 colocalize on lysosomes. Can they add a lysosomal staining (e.g. LAMP1) to really prove this point and show the lysosomal localisation of mutants? And, more in general, the authors should include a colocalization analysis (e.g. Pearson’s everytime they claim it - Fig. 1H, 3A, 3C, 4F, 4H and 6C). 7.	In Figure 3E,F, it seems that also the monomeric version of DNAJC5 accumulates inside lysosomes and this is impaired when microautophagy is blocked. Can the authors comment and expand in the result section about the WT phenotype? 8.	In Figure 3H,I, the treatment with TAK-243 induces the reduction of lysotracker signal also in cells overexpressing the WT isoform. Why? The authors can include the quantification of untreated cells too. 9.	In Figure 4 (A and B) and Extended data Fig.5, the authors employed CRISPR screens and identified CHIP as a candidate regulator and then they further supported this finding through KO and rescue experiments. The claims they made here can be sufficiently supported by the data they showed. However, one concern  is the noticeable difference between the screening results of the WT and ΔJ conditions, as there are relatively few overlapping hits. What could explain this divergence? How feasible is it to use Keima-DNAJC5 with L116Δ for CRISPR screen instead of using DNAJC5 WT and  ΔJ? Does the Keima-DNAJC5ΔJ mutant have the same aggregation and/or lyso-toxicity phenotype as observed with the L116Δ mutation? Considering that both DNAJC5 WT and the ΔJ mutant are involved in misfolding-associated protein secretion (MAPS) and microautophagy (PMID: 35506243), but the ΔJ mutant lacks MAPS activity, is it appropriate to use the ΔJ mutant as a substitute for the L116Δ mutation? How is this choice justified in the context of the study? 10.	In Figure 4D, is the observed leftward shift, particularly in case of sh-CHIP, substantial enough to confidently conclude that there is a decrease in the association of Keima-DNAJC5 WT with lysosomes? It would strengthen the claim if this was quantitatively assessed and supported by statistical analysis. 11.	In Figure 4E, we would expect similar immunoprecipitation efficiency for all FLAG-tagged proteins using FLAG beads. The recruitment of the various FLAG-DNAJC5 constructs to the beads should be comparable—consistent with what is shown for FLAG-DNAJC5 WT, L115R, and L116Δ—in order to confidently conclude that the co-immunoprecipitation demonstrates CHIP can bind both WT DNAJC5 and the CLN4 mutants independently of the J domain. Alternatively, if transfection efficiency or expression levels of FLAG-DNAJC5 ΔJ present an issue, the protein level of FLAG-DNAJC5 ΔJ in the input should be provided to clarify this point. 12.	In Figure 4F, from the representative confocal images, Ci-L116∆ mutant in CHIP-KO appears to be localized also on cell periphery or boundary along with punctate localization. Also, it would be better to show the status of ubiquitin and HGS staining in CHIP’KO cells without any over-expression of CLN4 mutants to appreciate the role of CHIP in microautophagy of CLN4 mutants. 13.	In Figure 4G, I and K, the figure legends for the graphs do not clarify how the normalization of the Ub and HGS areas was done with respect to their untransfected (UT) cells. Did the authors use neighbouring untransfected cells from the same coverslip or did they use a common untransfected control for all the samples? Also, it would be more informative to add the untransfected column in the graphs shown in Fig. 4G and Fig.4I, similar to Fig.4K, to have a better comparison in the data. 14.	In Figure 5, the overall rescue effect of CHIP in this system is weak. Maybe the fact that their promoter only activates from d8 onwards is part of the problem? Would it be possible to start expressing CHIP earlier? 15.	In Figure 5A, the authors overinterpret their results and claim from only the fact that CHIP is in the NP40-insoluble fraction that it must be inactive. Could they check whether it really ends up in the HMW L116Δ aggregates, and maybe even perform an in vitro assay to determine its activity in either version? 16.	In Figure 5G, the authors show increased cell death in immature neurons which lack the lysosomal damage phenotype. What is the authors’ explanation for this phenotype? Is it linked to CHIP aggregates accumulation? 17.	In Figure 6, how do the different levels of lysosomal translocation make sense with their model? Shouldn’t the brain have the lowest level of translocation, since this is the only tissue where a phenotype occurs? 18.	We would recommend moving Figure 7 to the extended data, and spend more time in the text to explain the relevance of Tsg101. Currently the figure comes a bit unexpected and does not allow the authors a strong finish to the paper, since the phenotypes are less convincing than the ones in Figure 6. In addition, is there any quantitative analysis of the rough eye phenotype that can give a more objective assessment for the phenotype? Minor comments ●	In Figure 2F, the authors should also show the WT DNAJC5-treated cells. It will make the data more complete and solid, confirming that the WT isoform is not interfering with lysosomal homeostasis. ●	In Figure 2H, in the L116Δmono panel a control cell (intact) is missing. ●	There are no supporting images for Figure 5H (also not in extended figure). ●	In Extended Figure 6B and C, why does the WT go down too? Showing the graph like this is a little confusing, and also the normalisation.. and they should add also earlier time point to see if at d12 something is happening ●	Try to avoid using red-green as a combination in figures, to make the paper accessible to colorblind people. ●	Authors can homogenize how they show statistics in their graphs, either deciding to not show the p-value when it is not significant or to include it every time. Also, why do they often use n=2 and do statistics on individual data points? Why not add n=3 and do statistics on experiments? ●	The authors claim a microautophagy-based system that cleans up the DNAJC5 aggregates, which end up inside lysosomes. However, if the aggregates can damage the lysosome membrane from outside, why would they not do the same from the inside?",2025-06-13T13:20:50,,Anonymous,10.1101/2025.02.18.638932,CHIP protects lysosomes from CLN4 mutant-induced membrane damages,"Juhyung Lee, Jizhong Zou, Wan Nur Atiqah Binti Mazli, Natalie Chin, Michal Jarnik, Layla Saidi, Yue Xu, John Replogle, Michael Ward, Juan Bonifacino, Wei Zheng, Ling Hao, Yihong Ye",2025-02-19
