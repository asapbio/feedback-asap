(A-C) It has been reported by many groups that PA14 is mildly attractive to C. elegans, that is, given a choice between PA14 and OP50, worms choose PA141,2. However, in almost every assay shown in this paper, the worms prefer OP50 over PA14 – that is, they are already avoiding PA14 - prior to training (naïve preference), which is odd. This suggests that the authors are not using conditions that are standard, either in PA14 or OP50 growth or in choice assays (see note about choice assay performance). This is a serious cause for concern that is independent of any training conditions. In fact, as far as we can see, in only one case (Fig. 1C, F1) did their experiments replicate the naïve choice results observed by other groups. 2.	Choice assays: their “choice assays” involve putting 3-4x the recommended number of worms on a plate (up to 770 on a spot!), letting them roam for variable amounts of time (“30-60 minutes”) without trapping them (no azide or other paralytic used), and then putting them in a 4°C incubator (which does not immediately halt worm movement), then counting them. None of this follows our published choice assay protocols, or the standard chemotaxis assay protocol3–6. Putting more than 200 worms on a single plate can lead to altered choice because of crowding. In the absence of a paralytic, worms change their preference due to various factors, including adaptation; therefore, in this case, the worms’ first choice (which is what we measure in all our assays) is not being measured. They also count the worms by “aspirating” the worms off of the plate, which is not standard in any behavioral assays, as far as we know. 3.	Table 2 and Figure 1: There are almost no true replicates, as in each experiment, at least one or more condition is changed. (For example, the authors only tested the PA14 we sent them in one replicate - Exp 3). 4.	daf-7p::GFP imaging experiments (Fig. 1D, F, H) – Hunter and colleagues do not report seeing increased daf-7p::gfp expression in the P0 generation. Increased daf-7p::gfp expression after exposure to PA14 has been reported by multiple groups7, not just ours, and is usually not small or highly variable, as it is due to the combination of bacterial cues and P11 small RNA; if they cannot replicate this basic result, it suggests that something is seriously wrong with their protocols or technique, or their worms are very sick, even before trying to use our protocol to train worms. 5.	Additionally, they do not report the expression of daf-7p::gfp in the ASJ neuron7, which is very strange, since we have been able to reliably replicate Meisel, et al.’s finding in the P0 generation. Therefore, it is not clear from which neuron the authors are quantifying daf-7p::gfp levels. 6.	Instead of imaging and reporting fluorescence levels in individual neurons, the authors averaged fluorescence intensity/worm, which is explicitly not what we did or others have done, because different neurons in each worm can have different intensities – particularly if they are the ASI rather than ASJ neurons. 7.	While we see modest decreases in fertility after PA14 training, the authors report severe decreases in fertility: about one fifth of normal egg production, and a severe developmental delay) in their F1 generation that we do not observe. Both facts indicate that their worms are very sick, even the worms that have not been exposed to PA14. If their worms are extremely sick, it might account for the small number of progeny, poor imaging results, and a developmental delay that shifted the training times. This could be a result of overbleaching, which causes developmental delays; the bleaching protocol described in Gainey et al. deviates from our published protocol. Additionally, they add Triton X100 to their final M9 wash, which is used (although at a higher concentration) to permeabilize embryos in other protocols. We are not aware of any bleaching protocols that include Triton in a wash step, and our lab certainly does not; this addition might also damage the progeny. Figure 2 1.	P0 imaging data suggest that the daf-7p::gfp response to PA14 is not reproducible in their hands; again, this has nothing to do with our paper or protocols, but rather appears that they cannot replicate previous results in the field that precedes our work. 2.	Does “25°C” mean that the worms were grown at or assayed at 25°C, or both? This high temperature is generally hard on the worms. 3.	Technical note: it appears that instead of consistently picking fluorescent daf-7p::gfp animals, the authors “chunked” large groups of worms, resulting in populations of non-fluorescent animals in their experiments. 4.	Scale of P0 and F1 are extremely different (due to sickness of the P0s?). Figure 3 1.	Notes that panels A, C, and D are repeated from Figure 1. 2.	The authors discuss “OP50 aversion” but this does not make sense, since both trained and untrained animals are placed on HGs after bleaching. 3.	Their naïve in F1 is sometimes even lower than in the P0 (Fig. 3D). 4.	There is no consistency in their results across replicates, within experiments, or across figures of the paper – not just the inability to see an F2 effect, but in their naïve chemotaxes, P0 trained choice indices, and F1 results; the authors claim that their F1 assays are reproducible, but only 3 out of the 9 assays in this figure show F1 learned avoidance. 5.	In 3J, data that are not replicates, as they have been performed using different conditions, have been pooled. 6.	Gainey et al. observe substantial variation in behavior between training plates (Figure 3, table 2, S2 annotated protocol), and incorrectly treat each training plate as a biological replicate, rather than a technical replicate. (Each training plate is seeded and grown in the same conditions, and worms from the same bleached population are added onto the plates, therefore these are not biological replicates but rather technical replicates; biological replicates require starting with different worm populations and carrying out the whole experiment independently.) In our hands, behavior from a set of training plates is always consistent. 7.	Additionally, we note that the authors use the same population of worms for the choice assays and subsequently for bleaching, meaning that worms are held in liquid for an extended time before bleaching; this may cause worms additional stress which may interfere with behavior. Figure 4 1. OP50 growth conditions: this would only matter if the controls and experimentals were grown on different plate types, which is not the case (but if the authors are in fact putting the controls on different plates from experimentals, then the experiment is done incorrectly). Figure 5 1.	We also found that sid-1 and sid-2 are required, but since their controls are inconsistent (Fig. 3) in the first place, it is hard to know how to interpret their data. 2.	Other mutants (rde-1, hrde-1, sid-1, sid-2) – still show increased daf-7p::gfp in F1 – again, these data are hard to interpret since they do not show a wild-type control that worked here. This also has little bearing on our work since other training paradigms (e.g., 4- and 8-hour training that engages small RNA-independent pathways) also induce daf-7p::gfp. It is also unclear which neuron (ASI vs ASJ) they are imaging. Discussion 1.	daf-7p::gfp - Picking fluorescent worms or rollers is standard worm husbandry; it is not a “result” to say that they noticed that Rol can be lost – but it does indicate that they should have discarded any results that they obtained before noticing that the array might have been lost in the worms they assayed. The fact that they have brought this up more than once suggests that they are not using standard accepted practices to maintain transgenic lines. 2.	Dennis Kim’s work on phenazine-induced avoidance has been oddly neglected in this work7. Kim’s group found that phenazine-1-carboxamide induces Pdaf-7::gfp expression in the ASJ neuron, which we see quite reliably in our assays as well. No Pdaf-7::gfp imaging of the ASJ neuron is presented in this work, suggesting that either the PA14 they grew also did not make phenazines, or their image analysis is unreliable. 3.	They made a lot of changes to our protocol (temperatures, light/dark, etc). We cannot find in this paper a single example of an experiment that followed our protocol entirely. 4.	The authors make a point of calling OP50 a pathogen, which is odd; C. elegans grown on OP50 typically live for 2-3 weeks. They cite Garigan et al. 20028, which showed that when worms get old (past 15 days) eventually the pharynx stops grinding up bacteria and the gut will start to fill up with OP50, and killing bacteria does slightly extend lifespan - but this is not an effect observed in young (Day 1) animals on the short timescales used in the experiments here. In any case, since both control and trained animals are grown on HG plates with OP50, it cannot explain the behavior of the control animals. 5.	The authors also never replicate the “bias towards Pseudomonas in choice assays ((Ha et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2017; Moore et al., 2019)” – Those papers also used OP50 vs PA14 to demonstrate this bias towards Pseudomonas, so it is unclear how the author think that their failure to replicate this basic finding is somehow supportive of any of their arguments. It is more likely that there is something fundamentally wrong in their initial conditions that have prevented the replication of all other groups’ findings, not just ours. Moreover, in our experiments, other than the 24 hrs of training on PA14 vs OP50, our control and trained animals are always on the same plates. This argument makes no sense, unless the authors have introduced an additional variable of plating control worms on one kind of plate/bacteria and their trained animals on a different plate/bacteria (which we do not do). 6.	It is unclear why the authors grew worms at different temperatures. 20°C is the standard temperature for worm growth and assays. 7.	In our hands, naïve OP50-PA14 choice index is not significantly different between P0 (when NGM plates are used) and the subsequent generations (when HG plates are used).  The survival assay correlates well with the idea that their worms are very sick, much sicker than we see in our assays, although the sparse intervals in both assays make it difficult to draw any conclusions – not possible to draw the conclusion that the bacteria are “more lethal” since they are trying to compare two lifespans from different labs etc. - but if they are, it might be due to their PA14 cultivation conditions or the health of their worms. But the fact that they see massive leaving and desiccation of worms, they might indeed be growing PA14 under much more pathogenic conditions. 8.	The authors state: “Near the conclusion of these experiments, we received an updated protocol that included several clarifying edits and additional deviations from the published protocols (C. Murphy, Personal communication).” We clarified our protocols, we didn’t “deviate” from them. This is a concerning way to present our email communications in which we tried to correct errors in their protocol and offer constructive advice; we even extended an invitation to Hunter to visit our lab to learn the assay. We are happy to provide these emails if necessary. In order to help others, we continuously update our lab’s protocols to make clarifications that will help future users. Any note from the Murphy lab is an example of this type of updating. For example, later we made a new bacterial construct that used a Kan marker and constitutive promoter instead of an Ara inducible promoter and Carb marker to streamline experiments. This is not a deviation, it is a natural progression of the research in our lab and our practice of continuously improving our assays and updating protocols. It is disingenuous for the authors to present our updates to our protocols as if we have “deviated” from them – in every instance, we gave the authors all of the information that we had available to us at the time. Our suggestions were made genuinely and in good faith, with the assumption that the authors wanted to get the assay working rather than using it to point out changes in our protocol. Moreover, this statement corroborates our assertion that all or most of the data in this paper seem to have been generated using a protocol that differs significantly from our lab’s, as the bulk of their experiments appear to have been done before contacting us: “Incorporating these changes into our procedures did not reliably alter our results.” (no data shown) 9.	“[T]his example of TEI is insufficiently robust for experimental investigation of the mechanisms of multigenerational inheritance” – The authors failed to test the fundamental requirement for transgenerational inheritance, that is, the expression of P11 sRNA by PA14, which only happens on plates at 25°C. Since they cite our subsequent papers where we first identified P11 sRNA as the key to TEI9, then our finding that the Cer1 retrotransposon is also required for P11-mediated TEI10 and then our finding that other Pseudomonas species use a similar small RNA to induce TEI11, they are definitely aware of this fact. Thus, it is not clear to us why they have not attempted to test P11 sRNA levels while searching for conditions that would replicate our findings. As a result, we can never know whether P11 sRNA was produced in any of the conditions that the authors tested in the experiments shown. Together, Hunter and colleagues’ failure to replicate the basic naïve attraction to PA14 over OP50 demonstrated by other labs, their failure to replicate the P0 daf-7 expression published by other labs, and their failure to reliably replicate the P0 and F1 behaviors shown by other labs suggests to us that there are more basic concerns about their bacterial and C. elegans growth conditions, assay conditions, and assay techniques independent of any of the attempts to replicate the findings from our work.

First, I wonder why authors made the more extreme Gly mutations for the binding site removal instead of the more conservative Ala mutations. Because of the special role of Glycine the quality of the input MSA is probably a lot worse for Gly instead of Ala mutations. Second, I think authors should also report RMSD/pLDDT/PAE for the predicted structures itself and not just the ligand. Since AF3 performs the combined objective of structure prediction and docking mutation of the input has consequences for both objectives. It might be that it performs worse for docking because the overall quality of the structure prediction is reduced. We've looked into the related problem of metal-protein interaction and there AF3 does a bit better to capture realistic physicochemical effects: https://x.com/simonduerr/st...",2024-06-05T13:08:01,disqus_yZWzVrwDfi,Simon,10.1101/2024.06.03.597219,Do Deep Learning Models for Co-Folding Learn the Physics of Protein-Ligand Interactions?,"Matthew R Masters, Amr H Mahmoud, Markus A Lill",2024-06-04

A few thoughts: 1) It would be great to see how this compares to the PhyB-PIF version 2) Blue light should activate PhyB/PhyA, it would be great to see different blue light doses to see how sensitive it is to blue light, not if it is sensitive to blue light. (See ""Multi-chromatic control of mammalian gene expression and signaling"" and ""Multichromatic Control of Signaling Pathways in Mammalian Cells"") 3) I am not sure what biological replicates means. Where three independent experiments done, or just three biological replicates, one experiment? If a single experiment, this should be made explicit and perhaps written as N = 1. 4) PhyA could be written as PhyA-NT instead of delta. Delta implies it is a knock out or something. Peter Quail used the ""NT"" notation and that has been used a lot since, so it would be easy for others to follow. 5) What are the effects of far-red light, perhaps with and without blue light? (See ""Multi-chromatic control of mammalian gene expression and signaling"" and ""Multichromatic Control of Signaling Pathways in Mammalian Cells"") 6) Would be nice to see blue and red systems multiplexed. Perhaps using DRE as in ""Efficient photoactivatable Dre recombinase for cell type-specific spatiotemporal control of genome engineering in the mouse"" I am not suggesting these experiments or changes are needed to be published, but could improve the usefulness.",2024-06-04T17:49:18,phillipkyriakakis,phillip kyriakakis,10.1101/2024.05.30.596707,Red light responsive Cre recombinase for bacterial optogenetics,"Fereshteh Jafarbeglou, Mary J.

Prior to this work, changes in the maternal bacterial, archaeal, and fungal microbiomes in body sites other than the vaginal cavity and gut were poorly understood. The authors characterize the oral, urinary, stool, and vaginal microbiomes, and the urinary metabolome of non-pregnant, as well as pre- and postpartum women. They conclude that the microbiome of the oral cavity quickly rebounds after birth, whereas the vaginal microbiome takes longer to return to its pre-pregnancy state. The authors also conclude that the archaeal content of the oral microbiome correlates strongly with pregnancy status. We feel that most of the conclusions put forth in the paper are well supported. However, we have concerns about conclusions involving archaeal microbiome differences, and we have suggestions for changes in data presentation that may improve clarity. Major Comments 1. The authors do not consider possible confounding variables associated with pregnancy status. Hence, correlation of microbiome differences with pregnancy status might not indicate a direct causative effect. For example, diet and hospital visits are likely to differ between the three groups assessed in the study. The authors should discuss the potential for these and other confounding variables, and, if possible, incorporate relevant metadata in their analyses. 2. Figure 1B, Figure 2A and Figure 2B are informative summaries of microbiome content but they do not indicate variability between participants. We suggest including corresponding supplementary figures with equivalent plots for each individual person in each cohort. 3. The authors state that Methanobrevibacter smithii in the oral cavity is almost exclusively observed for pregnant women. This is most clearly indicated by Supplementary Figure 10. However, Figure 2C appears to show Methanobrevibacter smithii as the most abundant Methanobrevibacter species in the oral cavity for all groups, regardless of pregnancy status. The authors should clarify this apparent disparity. 4. The observation that Methanobrevibacter smithii is found in the oral cavity almost exclusively in pregnant women is one of the most striking parts of the paper. Hence, we recommend moving Supplementary Figure 10 into the main figures. 5. The data in Supplementary Figure 10 indicate raw sequence read counts. Given that read counts are a function of total read depth, we recommend including a more thorough analysis of these data, including a statistical test of significance for the differences observed between cohorts. 6. The authors describe “semi-quantitative” and “qualitative” approaches to detect archaeal taxa. The potential weaknesses of these approaches should be discussed in the Results section. The authors should also indicate which method was used for each of the datasets shown in the figure panels. What does “semi-quantitative” mean? And is it possible to draw conclusions from data generated by “semi-quantitative” or “qualitative” approaches? Minor Comments 1. It would be helpful for non-experts to include definitions of some of the jargon used in the main body of the paper, such as Shannon diversity, richness, alpha diversity and beta diversity. 2. The presentation of metabolomic data in Figure 4B would be enhanced by (i) including a table in which the raw numbers are reported, and (ii) flipping the x-axis to provide a more intuitive view (highlights regulation postpartum). 3. The most abundant bacterial genera in each sample type (stool, oral, urine and vaginal samples) are more clearly communicated in Supplemental Figure 3 than in Figure 1B. This is especially true for stool data, where the microbiome composition is quite different from that in the other body sites, meaning that most taxa are reported as “other”. Hence, we suggest using Supplemental Figure 3 in the main body of the text rather than 1B. 4. In Figure 4A, glucose, succinic acid and fumaric acid are decreased in the postpartum state urine compared with pregnant state urine. Glucose is the starting energy molecule for glycolysis, and succinic acid and fumaric acid are intermediates in the TCA cycle.  Can the authors comment on whether their decrease in postpartum women is a function of the catabolic energy status during lactation? 5. It would be helpful to include text that explains the characteristics of each CST grouping to help the reader better understand (i) how the samples were separated into these groups, and (ii) the significance of CST of the different groups. 6. Figure 3B. This representation is confusing, especially since there are lines with a single point on one side and multiple points on the other. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the data representation in the figure legend. 7. We recommend that the authors consider using color palettes that will make it easier for people with color blindness to distinguish between colors. 8. The representation of data in Figure 2C is difficult to follow. Can the authors use the same representation as Figure 2B? 9. Many of the references to supplementary figures are incorrect. Suggestion for a Future Experiment A further experiment may include collection of stool samples postpartum as well to look at multiple time-points postpartum. It would be particularly interesting to include later postpartum samples to observe how long it takes to return to the prepregnancy microbiome in each body site.",2024-06-03T17:49:15,disqus_y9FR6hyg5J,Joseph Wade,10.1101/2023.08.31.555744,The Dynamics of the Female Microbiome: Unveiling Abrupt Changes of Microbial Domains across Body Sites from Preconception to Perinatal Phase,"Charlotte J Neumann, Manuela-Raluca Pausan, Victoria Haid, Eva-Christine Weiss, Vassiliki Kolovetsiou-Kreiner, Bettina Amtmann, Petra Winkler, Alexander Mahnert, Evelyn Jantscher-Krenn, Christine Moissl-Eichinger",2023-09-01

Previous work suggested that TofI/R was the dominant regulator over QsmR in B. glumae quorum sensing. Here, the authors identify independent roles of TofI/R, distinct from QsmR, and suggest a regulatory effect of QsmR on TofI/R. Moreover, the authors conclude that the QsmR variant T50K substantially reduces B. glumae virulence. The conclusions regarding the hierarchy of TofI/R and QsmR are generally well-supported across multiple independent assays, although there are some inconsistencies between the RT-qPCR and the RNA-seq data. The conclusions regarding the importance of the genotype of qsmR rely heavily on control data that are not shown; in the absence of these data, it is impossible to draw a strong conclusion on the contribution of qsmR to virulence. Major Comments 1. There are some inconsistencies between the RT-qPCR and the RNAseq data.  While the RT-qPCR data indicate ~4-5 times higher toxJ transcripts in 411gr-6 vs 336-gr1, the transcriptomic data from Figure 10 show no difference between the two strains.This is similar for toxA, but the difference between the two isn’t as big. Could the authors provide an explanation for these apparent inconsistencies between experiments? It would also be helpful if the authors could indicate in Figure 10 the variability between replicates. 2. In Figure 9, the authors show that introducing qsmR from a virulent strain into an avirulent strain that produces the T50K variant of QsmR restores virulence. But the key control of introducing the variant qsmR is listed as “not shown”. Data for this control are critical to support the authors’ conclusions and should be included in the figure. We also recommend that the authors complement qsmR deletion mutants with qsmR (both T50K and wild-type) to test whether these can restore virulence phenotypes. 3. In Figure 9 A, C, and D, can the authors include a positive control to indicate the extent to which introducing qsmR restores virulence? Minor Comments 1. Why and how were qRT-PCR data normalized to two housekeeping genes? 2. Can the authors include a brief discussion on the subset of virulence genes chosen for the RNA-seq? 3. It would be informative if the avirulent strain could be used as a control in Figure 2. 4. The method used by the authors to quantify disease severity does not appear to be quantitative and could be difficult to reproduce. Could the authors provide a quantitative assay to allow other groups to reproduce these experiments? Additionally, can the authors comment on whether or not samples were blinded before assessing disease severity, given the possibility for unconscious bias? 5. Could the authors clarify their use of statistical significance markers (Figures 2B and 2D). 6. Figure 10B might be better represented as a heatmap. 7. Figure 9B. For those outside the field, it would be helpful to describe in the text the phenotypic differences for infected virulent vs. infected nonvirulent vs. uninfected. 8. It would benefit the reader if there was a final model figure to tie everything together.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.27.568812v1#comment-6472732526,biorxivstage,0,"Windford and collaborators have studied a community-based cohort of aging and dementia of 84 participants (44 females and 40 males) and used flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to analyze naïve and effector-memory T cell populations. The authors showed that CD8+ TEMRA were positively correlated with Neurofilament Light chain (Nf-L) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP). In marked contrast, the authors found no significant difference in CD8+ TEMRA cells based on cognitive scores and no associations between CD8+ TEMRA and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related biomarkers (ADRB). The authors conclude that their findings suggest that the accumulation of CD8+ TEMRA cells in peripheral blood may be a response to neuronal injury (Nf-L) and neuroinflammation (GFAP) during aging or the progression of AD and ADRB. We agree with Windford and collaborators that the accumulation of CD8+ TEMRA cells in peripheral blood may be a response to neuronal injury. However, this response may go into opposite directions, that is, protective vs. harmful. In this respect, the authors did not mention a previous study in a cohort of elderly people differing in their cognitive status and some being diagnosed with Alzheimer disease (Esgalhado et al., Front Immunol. 2020; 10.3389/fimmu.2020.592656). Besides, the authors ignore that our analysis permitted us to distinguish two CD8+ TEMRA populations according to the level of expression of the phosphatase receptor CD45RA: CD8+ TEMRAhigh  and CD8+ TEMRAlow. Importantly, while CD8+ TEMRAhigh were strongly associated with severe cognitive impairment, CD8+ TEMRAlow were associated with non-cognitive impairment (Esgalhado et al., 2020). In other words, analyzing bulk CD8+ TEMRA cells might be a wrong approach, resulting in the disregard of valuable data. Since Windford and collaborators used a gating protocol to study CD8+ TEMRA similar to ours, it would be interesting to analyze CD8+ TEMRAhigh and CD8+ TEMRAlow in their community-based cohort. This may allow a change of paradigm and discriminate between potentially protective and potentially harmful CD8+ TEMRA cells. Elsa M. Cardoso*#, PhD Fernando A.

Thank you for sharing this very interesting article. In this article, you stated that “Molecular mimicry explains portions of the multiple sclerosis auto-antibodyome”. I suggest that you should take the findings of Martins, et al. (2023) [1] into consideration. These authors pointed out that although the amount of antigenic sharing between hosts and both pathogenic and non-pathogenic parasites and bacteria is massive, molecular mimicry by itself is not a sufficient factor to disrupt intact self-tolerance mechanisms. In this context, in my recent paper ( https://www.aimspress.com/a... [2], I provided the missing link between molecular mimicry and the activation of autoimmune responses. I figured out that activation of the purinergic P2X7R expressed on regulatory T cells is potentially required for molecular mimicry to activate autoimmune responses. This occurs only after repeated or high-dose microbe infection and not after a single low-dose infection. I also presented a novel model of immune responses in mammals to foreign antigens, self-antigens and antigens with molecular mimicry. I hope that these comments will help to improve the quality of your paper. Kind regards, Djo Hasan References 1. Martins YC, Jurberg AD, Daniel-Ribeiro CT.

Ethnonyms like Goths, Langobards and Frisians are political terms. They are not biological categories. Terms like ""Wielbark Goths"" (847) are entirely nonsensical. We simply don't know how the people of the Wielbark culture identified or were identified by others. Most likely they had never heard the name Goths and were not called so by outsiders. The name Goths appears only later in an entirely different region. We also don't know of the earlier ""Gutans"" had anything to do with the Wielbark-people or the later historical Goths. If you investigate the remains of a person buried in a cemetary that may have belonged to the Langobards, you still don't know how the individual identified whose DNA you extracted.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.18.585639v1#comment-6462725756,biorxivstage,3,"I was asked to review a version of the manuscript for a journal. Below are my comments to the authors. In this manuscript Shub and colleagues present MIC, a new tool for the analysis of three-dimensional macromolecular structures obtained using x-ray diffraction or cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM). Given an atomic model featuring water molecules and/or ions, and the corresponding 3D map data, MIC automatically labels each putative water and/or ion location with a guess water or ion identity. Thanks to improvements in cryoEM instrumentation and data analysis, 3D maps can now frequently be obtained at resolutions better than 2.7Å, so that the problem of correctly labeling small map features as either water or ion presents itself more frequently to practictioners, myself included. In that context the availability of a well-characterized, open-source and highly performant classifier of ion/water density features is timely and most welcome. I found the manuscript to be well written, the description of the method and how it was tested clear (though as a non-expert I had trouble following the description of the network architecture and of the feature attribution methodology), and the results convincing. Most questions that arose as I was reading early parts of the manuscript (e.g. regarding the influence of slight errors in modeling of protein atoms on the labeling of ions/water) were answered in later parts. I only have minor feedback & suggestions for the authors and otherwise am supportive of publication. Here's the feedback I have: - lines 47-48: Perhaps... but I wonder if the authors are aware of Ravera et al (Nature, 2022)... and there may be a few other reports I'm unaware of myself... I wonder whether a radial average profile could be used as part of the fingerprint in future versions of MIC to improve the quality of the labeling by the network. Perhaps the authors could comment (in the discussion?) about whether incorporating experimental map features could be possible in future work? - lines 189-190: ""this simple metric showed statistically significant separation between test set predictions that agreed and disagreed with the deposited PBD label"": I found this sentence confusing at first, and still do to an extent. To me the syntax did not convey the meaning of the figure unambiguously. To spell it out: -- My understanding on first reading was: when a site lands near a boundary (i.e. the model is uncertain), the model's prediction tends to disagree with the deposited PDB label. Doesn't that mean that if the user gets a result that is assigned low confidence, they should actually assume that the identity assigned by MIC is wrong? That would seem to be problematic... wouldn't it? -- Having reviewed Fig 2e, I now think the text was a bit confusing. My interpretation of the figure: at low confidence scores, say around 0.5, it's only slighlty more likely than not that there's a disagreement with the PDB; this is more in line with the behavior I would have hoped for... i.e. when there's uncertainty, it's a close call - not necessarily was the wrong label given... - line 213: ""The revised overall test set accuracy following manual annotation is 83.3%"". This is impressive. How will this translate to lower-resolution structures, where there will be more error in atom positions... I am thinking back to the fact that they authors found that fingerprinting worked best when using very fine shells... Perhaps this should be discussed somewhere [I think this is touched on in the paragraph ending line 269] - line 269: Right. That touches on my earlier question. When you get to the ~3Å range, unless you happen to have your coordinating side chains modeled really well, MIC is going to be quite prone to error. [I still think this topic of accuracy as a function of resolution should be returned to in the discussion] - line 432: ""MIC achieves incredible accuracy"". Hah! I think the authors should aim for the readers to actually believe the claimed accuracy, and it is unhelpful to characterize the accuracy as ""incredible"". I found the manuscript credible overall ;) - line 495-498: ""limiting all calculated (...) to be identity agnostic"" - I don't understand this. Might be worth spelling things out for non-specialists like myself - line 512: ""non/prune-fifp"" I think should be ""non-prune/fifp"" - line 513: ""prune-eifp"" I think should be ""prune/eifp"" Alexis Rohou May 2024",2024-05-20T00:22:12,alexisrohou,Alexis Rohou,10.1101/2024.03.18.585639,Metric Ion Classification (MIC): A deep learning tool for assigning ions and waters in cryo-EM and x-ray crystallography structures,"Laura Shub, Wenjin Liu, Georgios Skiniotis, Michael J.

I would recommend that the authors do not replicate the standard adage of how we have to study this beetle because it is a pest that is difficult to control. There are piles of literature on this topic, including two comprehensive compendia by the Forest Service, dedicated to the biology and management of this species. Foresters know very well how to manage forests to avoid outbreaks of the Southern pine beetle. There is a multi-state program for monitoring the population of the species, and predicting its local outbreaks. Case in point - the beetle was pretty much eradicated from the state of Texas, which is presumably why the authors had to use material from Mississippi. Studying genetics in order to ""kill the pest"" seems mistargeted. We know nearly all bark beetle outbreaks are a symptom of excessive stand density, warming climate, or introductions of invasive species, i.e., human-caused. So justifying this great research by the need to control the insects is not very convincing. The many incredible biological features of this insect would make a much more interesting justification.",2024-05-16T13:44:41,jirihulcr,Jiri Hulcr,10.1101/2024.05.08.592785,Genome assembly of the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmerman) reveals the origins of gene content reduction in Dendroctonus,"Megan Copeland, Shelby Landa, Adekola Owoyemi, Michelle M.

Limited Sample Size: In Figure 1A-E, I noticed that only 18 out of the 54 subjects were included in the comparison of biological age versus chronological age in EL subjects. Due to the already limited nature of having a large sample size of centenarians for research studies, it may be more effective to include more participants because having a smaller sample size may limit the generalizability of findings and necessitate caution in applying results to broader populations or conclusions about aging. 2. Including more controls: In Figure 3 where the forward programming of EL-specific iPSCs into cortical neurons was analyzed, I noticed that there was no control of an established cortical neuron cell line. Including this control, would be helpful in comparing the differences and similarities between the differentiated iPSCs and the cortical neurons, and would further help to confirm the pluripotency of the iPSCs created in this experiment. 3. Inclusion of Demographic Information: Including the demographic information of centenarians or the countries from which they come from would be helpful in contextualizing the study and understanding the possible influences on biological age. Considering that factors such as, geographical location, lifestyle habits and access to healthcare can all influence the aging process, including the demographic information of participants may illustrate environmental or genetic factors that may lead to exceptional longevity. Furthermore, having iPSCs from diverse populations may lead to more robust findings in that they would better represent the genetic variation across the globe. 4. Supplemental figures: While the inclusion of the supplemental figures was interesting in seeing the different population of immune cells in centenarians, there was not sufficient information for readers to see how these immune cell populations compared to offspring or their spouses. Having a control of an offsprings’ spouse would help your audience understand how the population of immune cells in centenarians may have lead them to living a longer life, and provide a clearer picture of the role of immune cells in longevity.",2024-05-14T04:54:31,,Erick Nedd,10.1101/2024.03.12.584663,A longevity-specific bank of induced pluripotent stem cells from centenarians and their offspring,"Todd W.

In the Discussion section of your manuscript you write that [REF20] maintained mESCs in 2i-medium and reported faithful emergence of endoderm cells . Given the importance of mESC culture conditions in your analyses and possible future interpretations (at least, re endoderm), I wanted to point out that — following the practice of the lab I was working in at the time — mESCs were not grown in the classic 2i medium (2i in N2B27), but in fact in a 2i in ES+LIF medium (exact recipe in REF20's Materials & Methods > Cell culture). Based on gastruloid end-phenotype alone (of those shown in FigS1), I would guess this atypical mESCs culture medium is most closely matched by your culture condition 3 (and possibly condition 4), and that those conditions (though they were not selected for scRNAseq) are giving rise to endoderm-rich gastruloids.

The authors have designed a FRET-based assay composed of N-terminal mClover3 donor and C-terminal m-Ruby3 acceptor fluorophores separated by a linker containing the Nsp2/3 PLpro cleavage motif to measure the proteolytic activity of PLpro. From DMS data the authors infer PLpro active site mutations ablates activity. Their study also revealed residues required for cleavage of the Nsp2/3 site, identified features of substrate binding pocket and the sequence requirements of the blocking loop. The authors have given explanations for their observations in the Discussion section. Overall, the paper is supported with follow-up enzymology and crystallography experiments of key residues. The major limitation of this study is leaky expression of mutations can mask clinically relevant mutations that can arise due to viral evolution and might have the potential to evade inhibitor treatment. Study of such mutations can provide more information about the potential escape routes open to the virus to evade developing therapeutics. Moreover, incorporation of statistical analysis could strengthen the confidence in inferences drawn from the deep sequencing data and improve the quality of the manuscript. The following points can improve the quality of the manuscript: Major points 1. In Figure 1f, it is unclear that why is the PLpro activity increasing with increase in inhibitor concentration? Perhaps the Y axis is mislabeled as while inhibitor concentration is increasing, PLpro activity should decrease. However, FRET signal would increase (and maybe should be the axis label), since there will be no cleavage. 2. Line 175 – 178 - What does 0 represent in the normalized dataset? What is the rationale used for selecting minimum 10 reads in the unselected library as the read cut-off. 10 reads is pretty low cut-off. From the data, it seems the distribution tails off before cut-off chosen for the s.d.- by eye. 0.3 s.d and 20 as read cut-off might be a  better option to eliminate sequencing artifacts. 3. Line 187-190 – What is the number of reads for the mutants that showed lower activity scores? There is a possibility that due to low read cutoff, these mutants might be lying in the range with low reads in the unselected library. 4.  Line 223-224 – Authors mention they find a good correlation between activity and abundance score. Although this is noticeable from the scatter plot but supporting high-throughput data with statistical parameters like pearson correlation coefficient, a metric that provides comparison between 2 datasets will make this data reporting more quantitative and informative. 5. Line 1340- Figure 3b- What do authors mean by variants with small enough error? Please be precise. 6.  Line 315-319/ Line 1550-1556- Extended data Fig 15c – It is difficult to interpret the inference reported that is based on the data in Extended Fig 15. There is no data reported for Normalized AMC cleavage for Y268W. Interpretation can be more comprehensible by plotting a scatter plot between the Normalized Activity Fitness Scores obtained from DMS data and Normalized AMC cleavage (%). Through this plot, the reader can easily make out the outlier. 7. Line 364-367 – Authors mention “M208W strikingly increases the protein melting temperature by over 5C, indicating a substantial improvement in thermal stability. Increased stability, and thus reduced turnover in cells, may provide a mechanism to explain leaky expression in our cellular assay and increased yield of recombinant protein for E.coli expression.” Since, leaky expression is a different issue, it is confusing why will leaky expression be a plausible reason for increased stability but less activity? 8. Since Extended data Fig 11a shows that variants display substantial amount of leaky expression, how have the authors taken this information into account while inferring results from DMS activity scores, especially since they are quantifying at the RNA level and not at the DNA level? Can the activity scores obtained for the mutants be normalized to leaky expression scores in some way, for example by subtracting the scores obtained from the leaky expression dataset in order to measure the true activity of each mutant? 9. Solvents are known to affect an enzyme’s activity, selectivity and stability. In Figure 5, authors should consider and comment about the role of solvent in understanding the mechanism of Michelis-Menten kinetics of M208 variants using substrates Z-RLRGG-AMC, Ubiquitin-Rhodamine and ISG15-Rhodamine. Minor points 1. Figure numbers need to be reformatted. Figure 3 onwards they are incorrectly labelled. For eg. ‘Fig 3’ is labelled as ‘Fig 1’. 2. Line 426-429 – In Figure 3b, L and R domains of papain should be labelled or highlighted in separate colors for the ease of understanding for the reader. 3. Overall, different DMS datasets obtained from different assays in the paper have different read cut-offs such as 10, 13 and 18. A consistent statistical logic for obtaining different read cut-offs across different DMS datasets will be helpful. Also, increasing the read cut-off might improve the data quality and minimize sequencing artefacts. - Reviewed by Priyanka Bajaj and James Fraser (UCSF)",2024-05-04T01:52:43,disqus_YtOuuM3QDF,priyanka.bajaj3193@gmail.com,10.1101/2024.03.11.584210,"Mutational Profiling of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in human cells reveals requirements for function, structure, and drug escape","Xinyu Wu, Margareta Go, Julie V.

However, genes associated with VCAM1-positivity were detected and these PT cells (which we called PT Class A) were present in Control kidneys and were seen in situ by RNAScope too.

I was curious if you would be able to benchmark it more, as the benchmark presented in Fig 1C is quite limited in scope, and could be expanded. We have shared R10.4.1 data for a variety of microbes that you might be interested in benchmarking on, include some with paired PacBio data in REBASE (which is not ground truth, but a good comparision): aws s3 cp --recursive s3://cultivarium-sequencing/MICROBEMOD-DATA-NOV2023/mapped_bams/ . aws s3 cp --recursive s3://cultivarium-sequencing/MICROBEMOD-DATA-NOV2023/reference_genomes/ . aws s3 cp --recursive s3://cultivarium-sequencing/MICROBEMOD-DATA-NOV2023/pod5/ . It is also worth noting that the comparison to MicrobeMod is a bit limited due to the reason that you note here: ""The low motif recall of MicrobeMod, at high coverage and high motif occurrence settings, primarily stems from identification of similar motifs that are not identical to the benchmarking motif, e.g. SNGAm6TC instead of GAm6T"". Despite this, overall my sense is very that nanomotif's motif calling will be likely superior in many circumstances to STREME in the context of prokaryotic methylation. Probably the best way to evaluate methylation motifs would be with some manual inspection after running multiple tools (and parameters).",2024-05-02T21:22:33,acc_account,Alex Crits-Christoph,10.1101/2024.04.29.591623,Nanomotif: Identification and Exploitation of DNA Methylation Motifs in Metagenomes using Oxford Nanopore Sequencing,"Søren Heidelbach, Sebastian Mølvang Dall, Jeppe Støtt Bøjer, Jacob Nissen, Lucas N.L. van der Maas, Mantas Sereika, Rasmus H.

It does this by looking at the microbiome found within mice at different ages, then looking at increased inflammation utilizing immunoassays. The results show increased innate immunity and inflammatory signals, showing that an older mice’s microbiome acts differently on the TLR signaling system. The manuscript excels on the immunological side; however, the microbiome side of the study lacks quality control and explanation. I would recommend contacting a microbiome expert to get more insight into the field, as there is much missing from this report. This review focuses on the microbiome side of the report, which has quite a few problems to work on. 1. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) details are missing, such as the primers used, the polymerase used, and the procedure used, such as the temperature, timing, number of cycles. The PCR is not repeatable based on what is said in the methods. Refer to the paper ‘The Impact of DNA Polymerase and Number of Rounds of Amplification in PCR on 16S rRNA Gene Sequence Data’ at DIO: https:// doi.org/10.1128/mSphere.001.... 2. When sequencing the PCR data, the number of reads per sample is not stated. This is important to know if the coverage of the communities is measured. The authors also do not include the observed number of taxa to compare to the Chao1 numbers to determine coverage. This is shown in Figure 1B, where the chao1 number is very low. The taxa used for this graph is not stated, leaving the reader confused if it is the number of genera, or phyla. The lower number assumes phyla, while genera is the more commonly used in the field and should be in the hundreds.  Showing the number of ASVs/OTUs in each sample is a common measure of alpha diversity. 3. The method to which the sequenced data was sorted is not given. The authors do not state if ASVs or OTU’s were utilized which leads to confusion in the way the dominant taxa were determined. It is also impossible to know if the sequenced data was corrected for 16S copy number, or for variance in genome size. Refer to ‘The Variability of the 16S rRNA Gene in Bacterial Genomes and Its Consequences for Bacterial Community Analyses’ at DIO: https://doi.org/10.1371/jou... Next are some more minor issues that can be addressed. 1. At line 340, the instrument and settings for the zirconia beads are not explained. 2. No reference is given for the CLR method at line 385. 3. In the statistical analysis, it states that data was rarefied to the minimum library size, but that size is not mentioned. 4. Figure 1A states P=0.002, however no statistical test is given to get that P. 5. Figure 1C utilizes the words upregulated and downregulated which are used with expression data. I believe this is abundance of taxonomic groups, so different word choices would be more accurate, such as more or less represented.  Further, you don’t know that age caused that, as implied by the phrase “by age.” - Timothy Tomkins, SHSU biomedical student.",2024-05-01T16:53:49,timothytomkins,Timothy Tomkins,10.1101/2024.03.22.586320,Aging amplifies a gut microbiota immunogenic signature linked to heightened inflammation,"Maria Elisa Caetano-Silva, Akriti Shrestha, Audrey F.

The levels in the three growth conditions of high, low, and ambient. It would be helpful to list all ingredients and their final concentrations for the three conditions as well. 4. Perhaps in the future, the use of transposons could also be used to track the genes that correlate with biodegradation of crude oil, and which strains/taxa of bacteria they originate. Making a isolated, pairwise and community could also help narrow it down. 5. PCR conditions for the V4 amplification should be described. 6.

I am a Sam Houston State University graduate student enrolled in a microbiome course, BIOL5394. My overall impression of the manuscript is that it is excellent, and the information presented is helpful for forensic science. Abstract and Introduction The introduction is very clear and to the point. Does this study consider where the individual's death occurred, indoors or outdoors? I believe the environment in which a death occurred could alter the microbial community succession and potentially influence your given results. What ethical guidelines were followed when handling the cadavers? Methods Quality control •	Need specific PCR protocol, like # cycles, temps, polymerase, etc. https://journals.asm.org/do... •	There is no mention of the correction of the 16S copy number and variances in genome size for taxa identified ASVs. https://journals.plos.org/p... •	Was coverage of communities measured and representatively sampled equally? o	Include coverage measures such as Good’s coverage or Chao1. •	Line 115 explicitly states the protocol for USA samples. What about the samples from Finland and Italy? •	Lines 113-114 mention sections of the dissected internal organs but fail to mention the specific section. Is there a measured area region that was dissected? This could help with consistency in sampling. DNA Extraction and Sequencing •	Lines 130-131 state the Greengenes database used to assign taxonomy was last updated in May 2013. More accurate identification results would come from a more recently updated 16S gene database. Statistical analyses •	Good practice to include the complete list of packages and codes used for the analysis. Results Figure 3 •	PCoA assumes normal distribution of data. Need to show normality test or use NMDS. Figure 4 •	The taxa in this figure show excessive “unknowns.” I believe updating the database could improve this. Figure 5 •	Lines 256-259 mention the findings of ASV family are in class Bacteroidia, however after reviewing I believe the correct class is Betaproteobacteria. o	Bacteroidia, Betaproteobacteria, and Clostidia are color-coded with very similar colors. Consider making the jump to the next class a bit more distinctive. Additional comments •	The article mentions the sample size was 265, but when I add up the four category sample sizes, I get a sum of 262. Is this intentional, or a typo? •	Of the 20 Finnish cadavers, why was the liver the only organ supplied? •	Overall, it was a very interesting study!",2024-04-29T15:59:37,disqus_UL51SLzfwv,Amber Gonzalez,10.1101/752576,Manner of death and demographic effects on microbial community composition in organs of the human cadaver,"Holly Lutz, Alexandria Vangelatos, Neil Gottel, Emily Speed, Antonio Osculati, Silvia Visona, Sheree J.

It gives a clear insight into the concern at hand and summarizes the key findings to show its significance. However, the research question is not clearly stated. This is something that can be elaborated on in the introductions, but it should also be stated briefly in the abstract. I understand that there is not a lot of research done on the effects of pregnancy to the female microbiota, but it is unclear as to what the research question is. This introduction gives a good background on the issue of pregnancy altering the microbiome. Below are my comments on what could be added or further explained. 1.	Are you trying to determine which organisms are lost/recovered? 2.	Is this study for a general understanding of the effects of pregnancy on women (pre/post birth)? 3.	Are you looking at a specific family of bacteria, fungi or archea that has a meaningful change during both phases (pre- and post-maturation) to see their effects? 4.	Are the women from diverse backgrounds (race)? 5.	Was this study conducted in the same location? 6.	Include more previous studies, if any, stating what others have claimed to be the reasons behind “side effects” of pregnancy 7.	Include your own claims on what you would expect and not expect to see. Figures and Tables The table heading and description are good and easy to read. However, make sure to explain all abbreviations. Table 1. 1.	What is the difference between an t-test and a Fishers exact t-test? 2.	What does SS-days mean? 3.	Also explain why each test was used for the p-value result. Figure 3. 1.	I am not sure what these diagrams represent. 2.	3B- What is a vaginal community state type? How were they classified? It is stated that software clusters them, but what are the criteria? 3.	3A- What do the colors represent? Explain the unknown portion? General comments for figures Figures captions need to be clear, like in 1C ii) the title is “Rchress.” Is that observed ASVs?  Include clear titles for your figures as well as axis labels. References to the figures from the results section show that the figures support the findings. You can include the reasoning behind choosing these graphical analyses. Methods, Materials & Analysis 1.	In your sample and collection section, it is mentioned that the participants collected their own samples. Is there a reason for this? Why did a professional, specifically a doctor, not collect the samples? Was there a way to determine that the samples were collected and stored properly? 2.	Does the study look at women across different races? Consider this please! 3.	How was Lctobacillus classified to species level using only the V4 region? That is not possible, the full 16S sequence is required. https://www.nature.com/arti... 4.	How did your account for chimeras and PCR errors before going onto further filtering steps? 5.	Further explain your controls. It was mentioned that positive and negative controls were removed, but there is no mention of their identity. 6.	What analysis was used to determine dominant and rare taxa? This was mentioned in the paper but was not included in the methods section. 7.	This study used 16S rRNA analysis to determine species present as different body sites, when the sequencing step is conducted to determine the species what the sequencing coverage is. Is it complete? In addition, how many reads per sample? a.	This was not stated at all in the paper, and it would be good to include it in the analysis portion. Results, Discussion, Conclusion In the limitations section, it is mentioned that the samples were not collected from the same women before and after pregnancy. Wouldn’t this affect the results you have presented? It is hard to say whether your results and conclusion support the claims which were made due to this aspect of sample collection.
