First the  Destrieux atlas is not a functional atlas. People keep using these sorts of atlases in fMRI work and I have no idea why. The Superior temporal lobe is not a functional unit. That giant big mid-frontal region is not the DLPFC and not well overlapped with what may be reasonable activity patterns for tasks such as the NBack. Also, the analysis appears to use Beta values from various contrasts. IME the average t-value is more reliable as a metric because it is (de)weighted by the noise in the voxel/vertex/region. In any analysis of general patterns of activity, I have found more robust using individual t stats rather than betas. Also you included many contrasts, including several that have obviously lower ICCs, and in most of the paper appear to collapse across all regions and contrasts. For the Nback, I'd mainly focus on the 0 Bk, 2Bk, and most importantly, the commonly used 0vs2Bk contrast. Those look like they have relatively decent ICCs to me. Relatedly in the figures you average across all contrasts, but some of them are not very good contrasts and as a result, your reported regional ICCs are dragged down. Rather than a take all approach, I think it would be better to focus on the primary contrasts as the ones being used. I object to the use of ROI as regions which you found interesting when the entire analysis is based off an atlas; the more conventional use of ROI is parcels, etc, in the broader sense, rather than 'parcels I think are interesting versus those I think may be less interesting'. I'm being pedantic but it confused me. (everything after this is me pontificating on things I think are interesting in general). Interesting and important point that contrasts vs baseline have higher stability than two task contrasts, but I also think we forget this is a truism. If you have an imperfect measurement, and subtract another imperfect measurement from it, the reliability of the difference must, by definition, be lower than the reliability of the two separate things (of I see this is mentioned later in the discussion). Important that the SST and MID tasks had much poorer reliability. My opinion has between that reward tasks generally have very poor reliability, potentially because the signal is not strong enough, but also because people may vary quite a bit with themselves even how they respond to trials, and oscillate. One point of potential import is that a lot of these analyses being done across the field are assuming task activation should be stable, but the brain, and fMRI, is inherently dynamic. Averaging activity by model fit across these relativity short tasks may not provide a very stable metric. Considerations of dynamic processes may yield greater information, but a big challenge there is motion (its always motion...) which makes dynamic measures really hard.",2021-10-14T16:31:13,colinhawco,Colin Hawco,10.1101/2021.10.08.463750,Reliability and Stability Challenges in ABCD Task fMRI Data,"James T.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.04.455110v1#comment-5569969364,biorxivstage,0,"There are several things about the data presented here, along with the author’s interpretations, that are concerning and warrant close scrutiny. 1.	From the Results section, it is unclear how many loci were retained for analysis. There was, evidently, more than one dataset that was generated because the authors refer to a “main dataset” in the Methods and to more than one dataset (with differing numbers of loci) in the Results. Also, at line 215, they state “3.935 samples remained from 55 individuals”. How can a fraction of a sample remain? Is a sample an individual animal? At line 219, they state that there is a dataset with as few as 7 SNPs. This is very concerning as any analysis on a RAD dataset consisting of 7 SNPs will likely not have any power to address their research questions. It is not stated which analyses are applied to which datasets; therefore, it is not possible for the reader to decide for themselves whether their results can be trusted. 2.	There are two oddities in the PCA that need to be explained. First, the PCA is not centered on zero. Additionally, it shows that 98% of the variation in the data set is explained by the first PC; however, there is no separation of individuals into clusters along the first axis. The authors ignore both of these incredibly odd patterns and focus on the 2nd axis to explain that some population structure is revealed by the second PC. I’ve never seen a PCA with these two odd patterns in the published literature, and I don’t know how to explain it (neither do the authors, evidently, since they made no attempt to interpret what is responsible for explaining 98% of the variation in their dataset), but it reveals a serious flaw in either the dataset or methods of analysis and should have been a warning flag to the authors. No other results from this study can be trusted until the oddities of the PCA can be explained in such a way that lends confidence to the quality of the dataset itself. 3.	Much of their conclusions are based on the results of STRUCTURE, but the STRUCTURE graph is not provided within the paper (nor is the supplemental documentation provided). The authors state that the best value for K is 3. If the pattern in the STRUCTURE graph does not show three clusters that correspond to geographically sampled locations, then this would need to be explained. It would be interesting to see what the STRUCTURE plot actually looks like given that the PCA is uninterpretable (the PCA and STRUCTURE plot should show comparable patterns). In the Discussion, the authors say that the inferred best value of K doesn’t match the STRUCTURE plot, stating at line 303 “However, examining the plots suggests that samples represent a single interbreeding population”. This discrepancy would need to be explained, and their explanation of more clusters, sampling scheme, and newly colonized subpopulations (lines 304-308) are very difficult to understand. 4.	The authors cite a study by Pfau et al. (which appears to be the most relevant study of this species) and compare their findings in the following passage. However, they misinterpret the findings of Pfau et al. and apparently do not understand the data upon which Pfau et al. drew their conclusions. The authors state at line 272 “More recently, [Pfau et al.] observed low mitochondrial DNA variation but high microsatellite diversity within the species. They concluded that genetic drift and not gene flow has had a greater impact on configuring D. elator genetic diversity. This result is possible because mitochondrial DNA has a lower effective population size than neutral nuclear markers such as RAD loci. Genetic drift could play a role in structuring mitochondrial DNA diversity, but more time would be needed to detect reduction of diversity in the nuclear genome using older markers such as microsatellites. An insufficient number of polymorphic microsatellite loci limits genetic resolution between individuals with supposed low population-level diversity. Our results suggest that RAD loci, that have a slower rate of mutation than microsatellites, are superior when investigating populations with weak population structure.” The first sentence is correct. However, the second sentence was only a portion of the conclusions of Pfau et al. and unrelated to mtDNA variation because that particular conclusion was based only on the microsatellite dataset. Pfau et al. actually concluded-- using microsatellite markers--that ""All methods addressing population structure indicated that the Iowa Park population was divergent from the others, with Vernon and Harrold showing a somewhat intermediate relationship but with a closer affiliation with Quanah than Iowa Park, despite their closer proximity to Iowa Park. This pattern did not conform to isolation by distance, thus genetic drift appears to have played a greater role than gene flow in establishing genetic structure."" Given the wording in the paragraph quoted above, the authors appear to be conflating the results from the mtDNA and microsatellite markers in Pfau et al. While it is true that mtDNA has a lower effective population size than nuclear marks such as RAD loci, Pfau et. al did not use RAD loci—they used microsatellites. It is also true that “Genetic drift could play a role in structuring mitochondrial DNA diversity, but more time would be needed to detect reduction of diversity in the nuclear genome”, but Pfau et al. provided explanations for why the mtDNA diversity was so low despite relatively high microsatellite diversity—going beyond just differences in effective population size. Furthermore, Pfau et al. found that nuclear microsatellites DID reveal population structure but that mtDNA did NOT reveal population structure (because there was essentially no mtDNA diversity which could be partitioned). The authors go on to say that “insufficient number of polymorphic microsatellite loci limits genetic resolution between individuals with supposed low population-level diversity”; however, microsatellite diversity was actually relatively high. The authors go on to state that RAD loci are superior to microsatellites. This is correct, but only because RAD datasets typically contain many more loci than microsatellite datasets. Surprisingly, the authors evidently didn’t notice that the microsatellite dataset of Pfau et al. actually revealed MORE genetic structure than their own RAD dataset (the opposite of what they predicted when comparing the two markers). 5.	The authors state “Our samples were collected on opposite sides of a cline, separated by a region of inaccessible private land, so it was difficult to determine if the slight differentiation is due to that distance or if there is true population substructure and isolation from other habitat patches” (line 315). A cline is found when there is a continuous distribution, but since they also state that it is unknown if populations exist between their sampling locations, how do they know that they’ve sampled opposite ends of cline, two genetically isolated populations, or two sides of a panmictic population? They attempted to use historical samples to fill in this distributional gap, but doing so ignores the likelihood that allele frequencies have changed within these populations over the sampled time frame. In addition, their predictions themselves are incorrect and difficult to interpret. They say “if the contemporary east and west subpopulations were indeed distinct” (line 320), which I interpret from the context to mean that the populations are geographically isolated rather than continuous. Given this hypothesis, they predict that the geographically intermediate population “the sampling hole” would be genetically intermediate between the two ends. This is actually the opposite of what is expected from population genetic theory which predicts that isolated populations diverge randomly with respect to one another. They predict the alternative hypothesis--that the species is one population--to reveal “greater differentiation between them and our sampling hole samples”. I do not understand what this statement is attempting to describe, but this hypothesis is the one that would predict the geographically intermediate population to be genetically intermediate—but only if gene flow is restricted sufficiently to produce isolation by distance. A panmictic population would show all three locations to be genetically homogenous. 6.	The authors appear to make an attempt to discuss their findings in the context of metapopulation theory (lines 349-358), but it’s confusing because of their attempted elaboration on what constitutes metapopulation criteria. They never actually make an connection between their genetic findings and metapopulation theory, but using other sources of information, state “this connection to metapopulation theory is still tenuous”. Yet they go on to state “Should managers elect for extreme measures to manage D. elator populations, such as translocations or reintroductions, knowledge that the population is a metapopulation is critical”. It seems especially careless to state that it is critical that managers recognize the species as a metapopulation when the connection is still tenuous. In conclusion, the striking oddities in the PCA demand a reanalysis on the quality of the dataset itself. If the dataset is in question, the results of all other analyses cannot be trusted. Furthermore, the many instances in which the authors misinterpreted their own results and made incorrect predictions from their hypotheses, are further indications that this study needs much attention before it can be used to understand the genetic patterns of Dipodomys elator for purposes of conservation and management.",2021-10-13T19:32:14,disqus_UiaQD0sAEk,Anon Anon,10.1101/2021.08.04.455110,Comparison of genetic variation between rare and common congeners of Dipodomys with estimates of contemporary and historical effective population size,"Michaela K.

This has been quite convincingly demonstrated in the two reports listed below. Thus, the data presented cannot support a non-coding RNA function. They are more consistent with the idea that the mRNAs categorized in this work as ‘translated’ encode proteins that are FA constituents, whereas the mRNAs categorized as ‘untranslated’ simply encode proteins that do not associate with FAs and likely diffuse to other locations after translation. Enam SU et al. ‘Puromycin reactivity does not accurately localize translation at the subcellular level’. (2020) eLife doi: 10.7554/eLife.60303 Hobson BD et al. ‘Elongation inhibitors do not prevent the release of puromycylated nascent polypeptide chains from ribosomes’. (2020) eLife doi: 10.7554/eLife.60048 2) The experiments using RNAse A-treated cells are perplexing. The authors are apparently assuming that RNAse A is cell-permeable, but that should not be the case. Are they certain that they are not looking at an effect caused by degradation of some extracellular RNAs? Different controls would be needed than what is provided in Figure S4A (RNase A will obviously degrade RNAs after the cells are broken up, but that cannot be taken to mean that RNAse A which was just added in the media was taken up by living cells and degraded intracellular RNA). 3) Ribosome profiling is performed from FA preparations that are isolated in buffer of low ionic strength and without Magnesium. However, under these conditions, ribosomes are expected to dissociate. Therefore, it is not surprising that no translation is detected for most mRNAs. 4) The fact that proteins encoded by FA-associated mRNAs are not detected as proteins in FAs cannot be taken as evidence for lack of translation. It is equally likely that the translated proteins diffuse away and have roles other than being FA constituents.",2021-10-11T14:54:04,,A Scientist,10.1101/2021.10.04.463097,Non-coding function for mRNAs in Focal Adhesion Architecture and Mechanotransduction,"Liana Boraas, Mengwei Hu, Lauren Thornton, Charles E.

Regarding the hypothesis of functional ANT at the epithelium cell membranes, these extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. In general, there are several technical and methodological points of concerns: Overexpression of ANT (mitochondrial ANT content is tightly regulated) can lead to miss-targeting, sorting or even excretion from cells, especially in cells with a high secretory capacity. It also has been shown that a significant portion of mitochondrial proteins are excreted through vesicles and Exosomes. Technically, there is the possibility of imaging immuno-histo/cyto-chemistry artifacts due to unspecific binding of primary and secondary antibodies (entrapment), when  employing fluorescence-immunocytochemistry in this notoriously difficult cell type. It would have been nice to have additional evidence for ANT localization to the cell membranes, either by immunohisto/cyto staining controls, a secondary detection method (higher mag or EM) or simple biophysical cellular fractionation (lipid fraction) and protein detection (western).

Nasalis larvatus (proboscis monkeys) often wade upright in mangrove forests, and already evolved shortened tails.  Aquarborealism also helps explain why we became much larger than monkeys, why hominoids are also called Latisternalia (""broad-breastboned ones""), why humans & apes have broad thorax & pelvis, with dorsal scapulas, lateral movements of arms & legs, and more centrally-placed vertebral spines (monkeys have narrow bodies, laterally-places scapulas, dorsally-placed spines etc.).

They apply a newly-developed method to do so to a large cohort of individuals from the Estonian Biobank and find different contribution from ancestral populations on variants associated with pigmentation, anthropometric traits and blood cholesterol levels, among others. They also look at patterns of positive selection on a subset of these variants. The manuscript presents an interesting and extensive set of analyses informing on a fascinating question about the evolution of traits over time and adaptation, as well as the genetic make-up of trait variation in Estonia. The authors also introduce a useful statistic to measure these contributions. I detail some comments below that I think might help improve the text and analyses: - While covA is extensively explained in the Methods, it has too brief of a description in the beginning of the Results section, given its importance to the associated conclusions. I would dedicate a few more sentences to explaining the reasoning behind covA, before assuming that the reader will automatically know what one means as they continue reading the results. I was a bit confused at first as to what covA was exactly measuring, and I think it's a smart way of measuring ancestral contributions to traits, so a bit more motivation for its use would be useful. - I think it might be good to move the text describing the connection between covA and f-statistics to the Methods section, for people familiar with f-statistics to motivate its use this way. I also wouldn't say that ""covA(i,j) has no interpretation in terms of branch length because of the fictitious nature of pA, an allele frequency which only serves as balanced comparison for the ancestries under analysis"". After all, the ""populations"" used in f-statistics analysis are also artificial groupings of individuals that share more or less history, depending on the analysis at hand. - It might be useful to try to separate the Eastern Hunter-Gatherer and Caucasus Hunter-Gatherer  into 2 ancestral candidate groups, rather than treating Yamnaya as an ancestral source. EHG, CHG and WHG have quite differentiated component ancestries, so this might help solve some of the correlation issues mentioned at the bottom of page 3? See, e.g. Lazaridis et al. 2017. - The study would greatly benefit from examining the behavior of the covA statistic using simulations of a phenotype (say, in SLiM, see, for example, the recent preprints by Yair and Coop (2021) and Carlson et al. (2021)). The authors mention the interdependence inherent to the fact that the same reference populations are used, and I am concerned about what other factors might contribute to the behavior of the statistic, including, for example: 1) varying levels of negative selection operating on a trait, 2) the bias inherent to the fact that some ancestral populations might be closer to the present-day population on which the trait was measured, 3) effective size of the ancestral contributing population under study, 4) heterogeneity of the average ""reference"" populations used as baselines for comparison and 5) sample sizes of the ancestral populations (e.g. low sample size for the Siberians). - The authors say that ""those counties for which the covA distribution is significantly different than the rest of Estonia (two-tailed Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, p ≤0.001)."" It seems like a large number of counties have an asterik. I wonder if *all* counties would have an asterisk if one had chosen a more standard p-value cutoff? Why was this cutoff chosen? What would be the null sampling distribution here for what one would call significant? That each county would have the same distribution of this statistic as the whole country? - Following up on this, it seems a bit strange to say that one intends to control the pleiotropies that exist between traits by avoiding overly stringent multiple testing corrections as Bonferroni. Without an alternative way to control for multiple testing (e.g. FDR, or looking at genetic correlations between traits), I don't think the best course of action is to err on the side of anti-caution and go with a vanilla P-value cutoff designed for single tests. What does ""significance"" in this context tell one about the importance of different ancestral contributions? - I commend the authors for adding a city/countryside residency covariate in their model, to control for socio-economic effects. I wouldn't suggest, however, that this covariate allows one to entirely control for other socio-economic effects (for example, socioeconomic or cultural effects that might not be well explained by place of residence). This is a very hard problem and the subject of extensive research (see for example Mostafavi et al. 2020). Maybe add some cautionary statements along these lines? - I'd be happy to also share this review on other preprint peer review venues like Review Commons, PCI or Peerage of Science if the authors so desire.

Given the increasing importance of disseminating science through preprints, I want to help support research in drug development and metabolism by providing feedback and thoughts on preprints in these fields. Your preprint caught my eye, and I hope you will find the comments below useful. This is an interesting paper proposing a method to target ARID1A mutant cells through PLK1 inhibition. The authors also show evidence that this mechanism is independent of PLK1's canonical role as a mitotic kinase and identify/investigate a novel function of PLK1 in mitochondria using an unbiased approach. Overall, the authors’ claims are well supported by initial evidence and communicated effectively but could be strengthened with additional experiments. Although, who hasn’t heard this before… Although there appears to be a difference in sensitivity to volasertib in ARID1A knockout cells in two non-transformed and one transformed cell line via a single timepoint celltiterglo and colony formation assay, the fold change in inhibitor potency is modest (Figure 1C/E), and this evidence connecting PLK1 and ARID1A could be strengthened by 1) comparing the growth rate of ARID1A knockout and control cells. By considering differences in growth rate, the authors might find an overall greater difference in volasertib sensitivity between ARID1A KO versus control cells. 2) adding an additional 12-point dose-response curve to Figures 1C and E using a non-selective cytotoxin (i.e. paclitaxel) in ARID1A KO/control cells, 3) adding a dose-response curve using the known SWI/SNF mutant selective OxPhos complex I inhibitor IACS-010759 ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go.... As the authors find the underlying ARID1A vulnerability is mitochondrial in origin, IACS-010759 would be a useful control in other experiments throughout the paper as well. The second main conclusion, which leads the authors to conduct a CRISPR screen, is that PLK1 inhibition does not differentially alter cell cycle in ARID1A KO versus control cells. Although this is clearly novel, it is a hard pill to swallow given the literature on SWI/SNF and PLK1 regulating cell cycle, and the connection between mitochondria fusion and cell cycle progression. I urge the authors to conduct additional experiments here. For example, make sure that the pHH3 staining in ARID1A KO versus control cells treated with 10nM Volasertib (Figure 2C) is not significant, use additional concentrations of volasertib (dose response for functional assays) and further investigate cell cycle checkpoints/signaling. The authors could also show the results from Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for mitosis/cell cycle related genes in addition to Ox Phos/Reactive oxygen species in Figure 4H/I. Beyond Figure 2, it would be beneficial to verify the basal ECAR rates in addition to oxygen consumption in Figure 4J/6B, as the difference in oxygen consumption between ARID1A KO/Control cells is minimal in Figure 4J, and as the authors found that ATP production between these cells was not significantly altered. I would assume that ARID1A KO cells would have diminished glycolysis and the difference in ratio of OCR/ECAR may help distinguish the overall significance of the difference in mitochondrial metabolism between ARID1A KO and control cells. Also, there is a discrepancy between Figure 4J and Figure 6B. Seemingly both are showing oxygen consumption via seahorse assay in GES1-ARID1A KO versus control cells, but the difference is substantially greater in Figure 6B? Additional controls for measurement of membrane potential and ROS, for example various OxPhos inhibitors, would also help pinpoint how an increase in oxygen consumption (Figure 4J/6B) could be accompanied by a loss in membrane potential (Figure 3a-f). Another useful control throughout the paper would be to reconstitute the ARID1A KO cells with a functional ARID1A construct and verify the functional changes in mitochondria are rescued. The overall novelty of this paper is the role of PLK1 function and volasertib activity on mitochondria independent of cell cycle, and publication of these results could help shape the use of volasertib clinically, and our understanding of signaling between mitochondria and the nucleus. Although additional experiments would help substantiate the authors claims, the work is clearly important to communicate with basic researchers and clinicians looking at both mitochondria and cell cycle in relation to cancer, and this work helps solidify the functional relationship between these two fields.

The authors identified that whole-body genetic deletion of LETMD1 promotes consistent reductions in mitochondrial structural and functional markers including reduced expression of mitochondrial proteins, low respiratory rates, and calcium ion levels. Such effects were paralleled to brown adipocyte whitening and accumulation of lipid droplets as well as systemic metabolic defects including impaired thermogenesis, cold intolerance, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, particularly under high fat diet. Although the results are very interesting and indicate that LETMD1 plays a role in regulating mitochondrial processes, the mechanistic bases underlying the systemic metabolic consequences caused by LETMD1 are not properly supported. Particularly, the relationship between mitochondrial Ca2+ and LETMD1 should be pursued by the authors to better substantiate the claim that systemic metabolic effects of LETMD1 KO results from altered mitochondrial Ca2+ and dynamics. Thus, I have observed some caveats and limitations of the present study as pointed out below, which authors might find useful to strength their conclusions. Major comments: 1)   The authors did not provide proper background literature to support the working hypothesis. For example, on the second paragraph of introduction, page 5, the authors state that “Interestingly, by analysis the expression profiles of LETMD1 in human and mice, we found that LETMD1 was highly expressed in the metabolism relative tissues, especially brown adipose tissue (BAT), and the expression of LETMD1 was significantly reduced in adipose tissues of the obese people and the high fat diet (HFD) induced mice.” I think this is a critical aspect to substantiate the studies on LETMD1 in adipose tissues. Alternatively, the authors should revise this paragraph clearly stating that background evidence is unpublished/preliminary. 2)   I have observed four important issues on the animal model used. First is which sub-strain of black 6 mice LETMD1KO were generated? Given that several sub-strains of black 6 are available, with distinct mutations that affect energy and redox metabolism ( https://www.nature.com/arti..., this is a crucial point that authors should clearly define. Second, the authors did not specify which sex and age were used throughout the work. Third, since the authors used a whole-body KO in their study, one might argue that factors released by tissues other than BAT generated by LETMD1 depletion might have caused the observed metabolic effects. This seems particularly important considering that LETMD1 is highly expressed in liver as well. Although this specific issue was not fully addressed, the authors should add a cautionary note at the discussion section, as well as balance their statements about the specific role of LETMD1 in BAT. Finally, since mice were maintained at 22oC which activates a thermogenic program ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... to maintain core body temperature, the authors should balance their findings to consider how LETMD1 deletion would affect metabolism at thermoneutral conditions. 3)   The authors should balance whether the observed whitening of BAT in LETMD1KO mice is a consequence of impaired brown adipocyte differentiation program or, a loss of mature brown adipocyte biomarkers. Specifically, given the strong and a consistent reduction in mitochondrial markers, one might think that either mitochondrial biogenesis is impaired or mitophagy is activated in LETMD1KO mice. Does LETMD1 deletion affect mitochondrial mass/content in other tissues/models? 4)   There is a clear trend towards increase in lipid droplets size in LETMD1KO even in chow diet, which might involve increased expansion of these structures due to improved association of mitochondria to lipid droplets. Indeed, recent evidence demonstrated that a population of mitochondria associates to lipid droplets in BAT to support lipid droplet expansion ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go.... It would be very interesting to see whether LETMD1 is differently located among mitochondrial populations in BAT and, if that is the case, then how LETMD1 contributes to lipogenesis and lipid droplet expansion. 5)   Considering that mitochondrial Ca2+ levels do not significantly rise upon adrenergic stimuli in LETMD1KO adipocytes, which mechanism mediates this effect? Since mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis is controlled by the calcium uniporter and NCLX activities ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih..., how LETMD1 regulate mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis through these targets? Since the metabolic effects of LETMD1KO in mitochondria involve an imbalance of Ca2+, and adrenergic stimuli cause a rise in Ca2+ levels, I think it would be very informative how LETMD1 deletion would affect respirometry of norepinephrine activated adipocytes. If LETMD1 negatively regulates NCLX expression/activity, then LETMD1 deletion would increase NCLX levels facilitating Ca2+ extrusion from mitochondria ultimately increasing respiratory rates. Also, as NCLX deletion promote adipocyte apoptosis ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih..., it is possible that LETMD1 deletion would render adipocytes more resistant to apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial permeability transition and limiting Ca2+ accumulation. Minor comments: 1)   The authors should carefully revise the writing to improve some sentences as the following example at page 4 “LETM1 was identified as a key component of ions transporter in mitochondria, including Ca2+/H+ transportation, K+/H+ exchange, Na+/Ca2+ exchange, and Mg2+ transportation to maintain the mitochondrial biology and cation homeostasis”.  Additional corrections should be made at: a)   the last paragraph of page 5 “Therefore, we hypothesize…”. b)   The first paragraph of page 6 “Mechanistically, our findings…”. 2)   The authors should better explain the different groups in graph legends. For example, in Figure 1C it is not known what the meanings of red and green bars are (which one is BAT and WAT?).",2021-09-29T17:05:51,disqus_IdVvoyU1Q9,Marcus Oliveira,10.1101/2020.11.18.388199,Deletion of Letmd1 leads to the disruption of mitochondrial function in brown adipose tissue,"Runjie Song, Yaqi Du, Peng Li, Huijiao Liu, Han Zheng, Xiaohui Lu, Shenghong Wang, Lijun Zhou, Nafis A Rahman, Sławomir Wołczyński, Adam Kretowski, Fazheng Ren, Xiru Li, Xiangdong Li",2020-11-20

If different mice were used to evaluate each timepoint then we believe that the two figures would be better represented as a bar graph rather than a line graph. Regarding your investigation into Caspases, we were curious if you spent any time looking at Caspase-5 activity?  Casp-5 can promote GSDMD activity as well. An important comment that many of us mutually agreed on was the lack of uninfected controls in your experiments.  Without uninfected controls, we find it difficult to fully accept the results you are proposing, as we have no idea how these differ from steady-state backgrounds.  We highly recommend that if you have this data, you import it somehow into your figures and discussion. We did have comments on figure arrangement, for while we appreciated Figure 1 and its establishment of the model you would use throughout the pre-print we thought that information was better suited for the supplementary rather than a “front-and-center” figure.  For example, it was agreed that information about the spleen size and titers in figure 1S would be more appropriate in place of some of the current figures in Figure 1. Additionally, we would’ve preferred to see Figures 3 and 5 combined in some manner, as they essentially answered the same question two different ways.  We don’t believe either needs to be excluded, but we do think that combining the two, or even placing Figures 3 and 5 consecutively, would give a clearer understanding of your results. There were a few visual comments we would like to mention as well.  While we appreciated the consistency throughout the pre-print, some members did mention that red and green are difficult to differentiate in grayscale prints and suggested instead using patterned lines or symbol changes to help strain differentiation.  Especially given that Red/Green colorblindness is very common.  Many of us also expressed concern over the size of certain figures.  Figures like 2D and 3J were so crowded it was difficult to see which condition was which without blowing up the image. Personally, I was very happy to see that you had included a figure at the end of your preprint visualizing the process you believe determines whether a Rickettsiae spp. will be virulence or not.  However, we were not very fond of the layout.  It took a moment to piece the figure together even though we knew well what each step represented as the delineation between what was pathogenic and what was apathogenic was not super clear.  We would recommend you make this separation clearer by separating the failed and successful host colonization pathways. I wish to preface this paragraph by mentioning that none of us within the journal club are experts in vesicles or phagocytosis.  However, we were all extremely confused with Figure 4.  We have no qualms against your use of fluorescence microscopy.  In fact, most of us agree that this was a necessary and powerful inclusion.  But the figures were not well discussed in the body of the text.  A lot of personal googling was necessary to understand why you were targeting what you were and even then, we still had questions.  For example, why were you targeting LC3B and EF-Ts, and which one corresponds to the actual bacteria?  I personally was very excited for this portion of the paper but felt a little disappointed about the lack of sense I could make from the figures.  Overall, we think this figure has a lot of potential, but that a robust description is necessary to gain a full understanding. Our last comment is by far the most important.  We wouldn’t have noticed had we not had the images blown up as we did, but we have concerns regarding Figure 4E and strongly recommend you check your graphing software.  We noticed that the bars for ATG5fl/fl + R. typhi and ATG5fl/fl-LysM + R. typhi were shifted slightly below the baseline of the graph.  We are optimistic that this is a simple mistake in your editing software, but our groups often use Prism and have not seen these kinds of graphical artifacts before.  Therefore, we strongly recommend that you look over this figure again in your editing software to correct this mistake. Overall, we really enjoyed reading your preprint and think that with a few adjustments and deeper discussions that this article could be very successful.  We thought your transcript was well written and greatly appreciated how thorough your group was with explaining how you got to each investigative point.  We do hope to learn more about how Rickettsiae spp. induce autophagy and avoid lysosomal degradation in the future!",2021-09-28T13:26:23,,UAB BPJC,10.1101/2021.09.08.459437,"Pathogenic, but not non-pathogenic, Rickettsia manipulate inflammasome-dependent IL-1 responses to facilitate their replication and host dissemination","Oliver H.

We had a quick look at genes in the molecular functions mentioned in your preprint and their expression seems to also be unevenly distributed in the fat body Fly Cell Atlas data. From our quick look it also seems that they are enriched in different populations of fat body cells which mostly do not overlap with the ones in which we see enriched expression of fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation genes. It is great to see that our two studies come to similar conclusions and highlights how much we still have to learn on tissue and metabolic organization.

Importantly, this work adds to the growing body of evidence that nuclear capsids are largely intact (Burdick et al. 2020; Dharan et al. 2020; Selyutina et al. 2020; Zila et al. 2021; Müller et al. 2021, Li et al. 2021; and others). However, for two reasons, we respectfully disagree with the conclusion that the “…HIV-1*CA14SiR represents a substantial improvement compared to previous genetic labeling strategies (Campbell et al. 2008; Burdick et al. 2020; Zurnic Bönisch et al. 2020; Pereira et al. 2011).”  First, like HIV-1*CA14SiR, the infectivity of virus labeled with GFP-CA as we described (1:15 ratio of GFP-CA:WT Gag) was modestly reduced 2-fold (Fig. 1B in Burdick et al. 2020), indicating that the GFP-CA labeling system does not severely reduce virus infectivity compared to the HIV-1*CA14SiR system.  Second, given the “minimally invasive” strategy used to label HIV-1 CA, it was surprising that the nuclear import of capsids containing CA14SiR was severely delayed by 6-12 hours (Fig. 3; Schifferdecker et al.).  In contrast, we showed that GFP-CA labeling of virions did not affect nuclear import kinetics of capsids (Fig. 2H in Burdick et al. 2020). It is not clear why the CA14SiR labeling has such a drastic effect on nuclear import kinetics; labeling most of the CA in the capsid shell with the fluorescent dye may alter the capsid structure and stability, influencing the timing of nuclear import as well as other capsid functions, such as PF74-induced disassembly.  We believe it is important to show that the labeling method does not have a significant influence on the steps in HIV-1 replication that are being investigated.  For this reason, we showed that GFP-CA labeling of virions did not affect the timing of loss of sensitivity to capsid inhibitor PF74 (Fig. 2G), timing of reporter gene expression (Fig. S1L), sensitivity to various HIV-1 inhibitors (Fig. S1M), capsid stability (Fig. S1E-F), association of capsids with nuclear envelope (Fig. S1G), nuclear import efficiency (Fig. S1G), and binding of nuclear capsids to CPSF6 (Fig. S4H-I; all figures in Burdick et al. 2020).

In the modified FLASH-seq protocol with a UMI-containing TSO, we do use separate PCR primers! We follow the advice given by the Authors of the Smart-seq3 paper and add 0.5 uM final F-primer to outcompete the leftover (unreacted) TSO after RT, exactly for that purpose: avoid over-inflating the UMI-count. We realised also that this part is not properly described in the Methods section and that, in general, so many variations of the basic protocol create some confusion.

Personally I compared some of the 2-3 year old models built by I-TASSER to AlphaFold output and found no discernible difference - typical homology modeling performance, none have much in looking-ahead capabilities, but at least the guys behind I-TASSER don't claim to have it.

We would first like to note that it was a pleasure to discuss the results in this paper, which we found rather interesting, and we had a very fruitful discussion. Nevertheless, we had several questions and clarifications that we were hoping you would be able to help resolve: 1. Could you please describe a bit more in detail how exactly bouts are defined and how bursts and bouts are distinguished from one another in the processed VNR signal? Is there an interbout interval threshold set to separate bouts, for instance? If yes, what was the value used? 2. Proof of the idea of measuring conduction velocities using voltage imaging is neat. However, is there some validation of the conduction velocities, as measured by the sub-Nyquist interpolated spike timing (SNAPT) method? For instance, can you compare measurements of conduction velocity by this method with, say, measurements from dual recordings with downstream partners to compare the delay between activation of a cell and the arrival of a PSC? It is not perfect, of course, but given that actually recording from dendrites etc is so challenging in small preps like larval zebrafish, it would be a useful reference value for comparison of how accurate the SNAPT measurements are. 3. The analysis of Figure 4 involves sorting bouts as those having >50% of active V3. This is a rather arbitrary classification, especially since there aren’t too many neurons per field of view so the difference between 40% and 60% might be just one neuron or so. Why not go the other way around, and first classify bouts as strong/weak and then ask what fraction of V3s was active, across all trials, by plotting bout strength against % of V3 active as a scatter plot? Moreover, we have some concerns with the definition of bout strength. Taking the average cumulative value as the bout strength doesn’t really capture the true bout strength, in our view, since it only captures amplitude, and not so much duration. In Fig 4A (bottom), for instance, bout #2 looks much weaker than bout #7 (which is longer). Yet, their computed “bout strength” is very similar. Why not use Area Under the Curve as a proxy for bout strength? It would capture both amplitude and duration in the definition of “strength”. This analysis may not change the results or the overall story, but is a more objective way of analysing the data, we think. 4. From the representative plots shown in Fig 5C and D, it seems that when V3 neurons’ activation is turned off, the bout ends. Yet, from the earlier figures, it seems that V3 activity is sustained even after a bout ends. Is it possible with the resources available to perform acute inhibition of these neurons during a bout, to test if shutting their activity suppresses swims? It would lend support to the hypothesis that V3 activity sustains bouts? 5. The switch to free swimming with optomotor response for the experiment in Fig 6 wasn’t very clear. Moreover, we don’t agree with the interpretation of the result about bout speed modulation in Fig 6C. From the raw data points, the distributions seem largely overlapping, and the difference being detected may simply be because of the large difference in the sample sizes between the control and the ablated groups. Also, how about doing the ablation experiment using the same paradigm as in Fig 5? That way, results may be easier to compare. Furthermore, it is interesting that there is no difference in bout durations in vivo with V3 ablation, although all previous experiments suggest that one should expect a reduction in bout duration on V3 ablation. This may be because of functional compensation/adaptation because of a genetic ablation of V3 neurons from birth. Hence, it may be better to perform acute inhibition in the V3 population during free-swimming OMR, provided you have lines to do the same. Other general comments: 1. Could the legends please include all n’s, as appropriate? Some legends have it, others don’t. It would make the reading much easier. 2. Fig 1G and Supplementary Fig 3  - clarify the dorsoventral axis schematic. What does 0-1 mean - as in, which is ventral and which dorsal? I think 1 would be ventral, given that active motor interneurons seem to be positioned that way, but a clarification is needed and would make the figure easier to interpret. 3. Could you please describe the filters being used in a bit more detail, instead of simply stating “high-pass filtered”? What filter type was used (Butterworth, etc.)? What were the cutoff frequencies (sometimes time constants are mentioned, but it would be better to be consistent in the reporting of these details)? 4. In the introduction, it is stated that “adapting motor output can also happen via changes in tail amplitude or force, without substantial changes in frequency.” Recent work from our lab - Jha and Thirumalai (Current Biology, 2020) - has supported this claim, and we have also shown using whole-cell recordings that this can be explained by changes in the intrinsic properties and recruitment of primary motor neurons at lower speeds. We hope you go through our paper and find it useful, in which case a citation of our work would be much appreciated. We hope you find some of our comments useful, and we eagerly look forward to hearing back from you. Thanks in advance.
