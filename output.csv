My only complaint is that it does not sufficiently cite previous work that reaches many of the same conclusions. Findings reported here that were previously published for Arabidopsis include the observation that sequences downstream of the TSS, in exons and introns, play a major role in controlling transcription (Rose and Gallegos, 2019, Scientific Reports 9:13777), that these sequences are unlike animal enhancers because they have no effect when moved upstream of the TSS (Rose, 2004, Plant Journal 40:744 and Gallegos and Rose, 2017, Plant Cell 29:843), that a motif containing the sequence GATC boosts expression in a dose-dependent manner and that mutating nucleotides within the GATC motif reduce its effect (Rose et al., 2016 Plant Molecular Biology 92:337). The Rose and Gallegos 2017 paper is cited but only as the reason for using the TRP1 promoter and for identifying the motif similar to GATC.

The toy figures at the beginning of the figures outlining the experimental overview are very useful. There are some grammatical errors in the paper for example “casual relationship” which should be causal. Which statistical test is being used is unclear and at times I believe the wrong statistical analysis is used. For example, figure 1 states that Wilcoxon test or one-way ANOVA is used for comparison, but nothing indicates which analysis is used for which figure. Furthermore, when doing relative expression it is unclear what the expression is compared to, some graphs indicate it is relative to IRPL13a, but it looks like this is not true as in figure 2F the MFN2+/+ HEY1 and ID3 are both set to 1, suggesting that is what is being compared. The labeling of figures also makes it difficult to identify what is being compared, again in figure 2F it is unclear what the p values are indicating as they are over more than two groups.

However, in my eyes your algorithm does not get rid of the spillover signal. In Fig3C the correlated distribution is the result of spillover from channel Yb172 into Yb173, as can be seen nicely in Fig3D where this correlation vanishes with the same antibody labeled to a channel which Yb172 does not spill into (Sm147D). Instead your algorithm seems to only set low signals to NA. To undermine this point, Fig1a shows that the spill-in signal from Yb172 into the Yb173 channel  is on average 2.7. Assuming the the mean of Yb172 bead to be of similar strength as Yb173 (~6.2) then for a cell population without Yb173 we would expect a difference of roughly 3.5 (in log scale) between the two channels if purely driven by spillover. Which is what can be seen in Fig3C for the CD3-low population ( i.e. they do not express CD3).",2023-11-09T15:17:53,,Bertram Klinger,10.1101/2023.10.04.560870,spillR: Spillover Compensation in Mass Cytometry Data,"Marco Guazzini, Alexander G.

The most sensitive methods used to detect low occupancy changes require crystallographic datasets to be isomorphous, which often limits their applicability. To address this limitation, the authors have developed MatchMaps, an pipeline that performs map subtraction in real space rather than reciprocal space, thereby eliminating the need for isomorphous data. The MatchMaps approach takes measured structure factor amplitudes from two states: the ON state (the interesting/ligand-bound/perturbed state) and the OFF state (the ground/apo/unperturbed state). Next, the algorithm performs rigid body refinement of the OFF state model (e.g. a model built/refined using only the OFF state data) using both the ON and OFF structure factor amplitudes. The electron density maps are then aligned by a rotation-translation matrix derived from alignment of the ON and OFF refined models. The authors apply MatchMaps to four different cases studies and where applicable, compare the results with isomorphous difference maps We tested the MatchMaps algorithm with some published datasets of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 macrodomain with ligand bound at 10-30% occupancy (​​ https://zenodo.org/records/..., ligand-bound datasets UCSF-P0628, UCSF-P2193, UCSF-P2227 and apo dataset UCSF-P0110) along with some unpublished data. The program is well documented and easy to install. With some generous help from the authors, we successfully used MatchMaps to reproduce ligand density observed in isomorphous difference maps calculated using the same datasets. The initial issue we encountered had to do with the default solvent mask, but this was overcome based on their advice. We also successfully ran matchmaps.ncs to calculate a difference map between the two macrodomain protomers in the P43 crystal form (chain A and B of apo dataset UCSF-P0110). Overall, the preprint is well written and the figures are clear and helpful. The major success of this work is the development of a method for the real-space subtraction of electron density maps to visualize structural changes between non-isomorphous datasets. This provides structural biologists with a powerful tool for visualizing structural differences between X-ray diffraction datasets and therefore will be of broad interest to the community. The major limitation is whether MatchMaps can be used to detect structural differences that are not detected using isomorphous difference maps, or to model structural differences that are not apparent by comparing refined coordinates. Although visualization is helpful, the real power in a tool such as this would be in its ability to detect and model low occupancy states. Major points The manuscript could be strengthened by including an example where MatchMaps detects a structural change that was not detected by calculating isomorphous difference maps or by comparing refined coordinates. The authors show how MatchMaps removes artifacts due to misaligned models (Figure 3g), but it is unclear to us whether MatchMaps can detect new structural changes. Put another way, it’s unclear to us whether structural changes that result in non-isomorphous datasets would be better visualized using MatchMaps versus a simple comparison of coordinates. MatchMaps produces two maps by default, one with a solvent mask applied and one without. We are curious why a map with a solvent mask is calculated. This mask is based on the OFF model, so any features of the difference map corresponding to structural changes outside of the solvent mask will be removed. If the solvent mask is required to remove noise in the MatchMaps generated maps, then it would be helpful to discuss this and give examples where the solvent mask was necessary (because this goes somewhat against the claim made by the authors that MatchMaps maps are less susceptible to “uninteresting signal” - line 215). The solvent masking also was a challenge for us in detecting some fragments, but was resolved by working through different options with the authors. An expanded discussion of the merits and limitations of solvent masking (and when to depart from defaults) is therefore likely to be helpful to many users. Do the authors envisage that MatchMaps could be used to model structural changes or just to visualize them? Along these lines, a comparison with the PanDDA algorithm might be helpful (Pearce, N. M. et al. 2017, Nature Communications). PanDDA can be used to both detect and model low occupancy states, but is most effective when data sets are isomorphous (so is typically used to detect and model low occupancy ligands obtained by soaking). Can the authors imagine an extension to MatchMaps where multiple datasets are averaged to create the OFF map in a similar way to PanDDA? Improving the signal-to-noise of the OFF map might remove the need for the solvent mask. Minor points Figure 3c/d. Can the authors comment on differences between the isomorphous difference map and the MatchMaps map? The density is similar but not identical. This is subjective, but to us the MatchMaps density looks a little noisier. Line 95. Are the data scaled with SCALEIT and then truncated (line 95)? Wouldn’t the reverse be more appropriate (e.g. truncation followed by scaling)? We were grateful for the -verbose flag in the command line, however, this only prints the output from SCALEIT/phenix.refine. Would it be possible to modify this flag to  print the output from all the programs? Line 104. How are the maps placed on a common scale? Figure 2f. Is there positive difference density associated with the terminal ribose (or the unmodeled nicotinamide) in the MatchMaps? It would be helpful if the figure legend indicated what part of the model the maps are contoured around. Line 350. The text says ±2.5 σ but the figure says ±1.5 σ.

Your data are very interesting and worth of depth consideration. I have only a doubt, concerning the retrieval of bacteria other than endobacteria in your spore. As you may know, we have retrieved many bacteria strictly associated with AMF spores (after 15 washings). Actually, you performed a de-contamination of spores, with H2O2 and chloramine T, so you assumed that the retrieved bacteria were endobacteria. As our previous works described the occurrence of bacteria within the different layers of spore walls, I wonder whether they may have been protected from de-contaminating agents in such a peculiar niche.

The paper presents a transformer-based model called sc-translator and employed 31 cancer data sets for training and validation. Training is based on a 2-stage process. Stage 1 is training on bulk (pre-training) and Stage 2 is training on sc data sets. The model is based on favor+ which is a transformer attention mechanism Pre-training: In the isoforms prediction example, it seems that isoforms are predictive of each other e.g. CD49a and CD49b and not through model precision towards each isoforms. Correlation seems to be driven by a small number of data in the plot (Upper right portion of the correlation plot). Also, application on new dataset other than PBMC is warranted here to assess generalizability. Immune response is harder to predict: rare immune cells The application on new data showed that pre-training is very important, however it is not clear why cosine is used and not correlation as an evaluation metric. Downstream tasks: -   	More benchmarks on the attention interaction network are needed. It would be great to see a few examples of which genes regulate which proteins and their biological interpretations. -   	Pseudo-KO experiments also need to be benchmarked. There are many CRISPR knockout datasets which can be used for validation. Biological interpretation is missing for these experiments. -   	It would be nice to have a conduct GSEA in KO experiments -   	Finally for cell clustering (Figure 5a), it is likely that batch effects in true proteins are subpopulations for CD4 and not driven by batch. Potential future use: -   	It would be nice to predict protein levels in a different setting such as drug response for example. -   	Conduct more benchmarks for KO experiments beyond EGFR and TP53 Additional comments: -   	Lack of evaluation in a real-life setting without the presence of protein data that can be used to fine tune the model first -   	Would it be possible to build a model for each protein or protein class which seems to make more sense because post-translational modifications vary between proteins and therefore fitting a single model can overlook these differences.",2023-11-03T18:45:39,marouenbenguebila,Marouen Ben Guebila,10.1101/2023.07.04.547619,A pre-trained large generative model for translating single-cell transcriptome to proteome,"Linjing Liu, Wei Li, Ka-Chun Wong, Fan Yang, Jianhua Yao",2023-07-09

Based on the reviewers' suggestion we will further describe the methods in detail to clarify the reviewers' concerns. In addition, we will include the age and sexes of mice in the legends of each figure. We will upload a revised version of this manuscript in a few months. eLife journal will publish the manuscript. 2) We agree with the reviewers that additional experiments are necessary for in-depth analyses of how elevated glycosuria increases compensatory glucose production. The goal of this project was to provide a foundation for future studies that will be informed by the list of secreted proteins identified using plasma proteomics, some of them may be correlative and others causal. At this time, it is not feasible to test each of the identified protein for its causal role in enhancing a compensatory glucose production. 3) eLife will publish a revised version of this manuscript in a few weeks.",2023-11-03T15:51:53,,Corresponding Author,10.1101/2023.09.01.555894,A kidney-hypothalamus axis promotes compensatory glucose production in response to glycosuria,"Tumininu S.

Whereas the current way of thinking about AF2’s MSA-predicted Cβ–Cβ distance maps focuses on their power to provide binary classifications of inter-residue contacts, the authors propose that Cβ–Cβ distances should instead be thought of as a set of collective variables that approximate a Boltzmann distribution. This is a novel hypothesis that lends AF2 the ability to decipher the conformational Boltzmann distributions of proteins. The authors test this in the contexts of protein dynamics, mutation impacts, and protein-protein interactions. They start with analyzing the correlation between AF2 contact distance and spin label distance distributions obtained from EPR spectroscopy using T4 lysozyme as a model, finding a general agreement despite broader AF2 distributions. Following this, they explore if AF2 can approximate free energy changes in systems that contain multiple biologically important minima, using EGFR KD studies for this purpose. AF2 accurately identifies altered contact distance distributions corresponding to active or inactive conformations in several mutations, indicating a sensitivity to alterations that stabilize particular conformational states. Next, they assess sensitivity to thermodynamically destabilizing mutations. AF2 was able to predict different contact distance probabilities for disruptive mutations like L198R in UBA1, but was less sensitive for milder mutations like L198A. Lastly, AF2’s sensitivity to protein-protein interactions was explored using the μ-opioid receptor (μOR). Although the helix displacement distances observed in the predicted structure of isolated and complexed μOR do not exactly match with expected values, AF2 did successfully predict differences in select contact distance distributions of active/inactive-state μOR. Demonstrating that Cβ–Cβ distance probabilities from the same AF2-learned distribution reflect distances observed in differentially behaving domains of a protein lends strong support to the hypothesis that AF2 contact distance distributions can approximate conformational distributions. The manuscript explores the correlations and sensitivities of AF2 predicted Cβ–Cβ distances across a variety of protein contexts, giving a broad view of its capabilities and limitations. Transitions between the various sections flowed well, and overall the writing was well worded and easily comprehensible. In addition, the presentation was balanced. It doesn’t just focus on the success of AF2, but also highlights where its sensitivities might vary or fall short, providing a balanced view of its capabilities. Given limited computational resources, the conformational space explored by MD and MCMC simulations is limited by their initial states. AI methods are instead limited by how informative their system definitions (MSAs and pre-set theoretical or experimental contact distance distributions) are, allowing AI methods, such as the AF2 method outlined by the authors, to more effectively sample conformational space. This is a very fascinating implication of their work which the authors have briefly mentioned in the discussion. This (and the connection to Figure 7 in the paper) warrants a deeper discussion, but the main conclusions the authors come to are within the scope of the manuscript, and are backed up by the evidence presented. There are a few points we would like to bring to the attention of the authors to strengthen the manuscript further. Major points: 1.There are some difficulties interpreting Figure 2. (a) It is important to mark the distances between the two chosen pairs of atoms in the active and inactive state. Without this information, the purpose of Figure 2D is unclear and Figure 2D, F and G are difficult to understand. (b) What is the threshold distance to classify a state as active or inactive? (c) Figure 2E seems confusing with different axis and ranges. 2. In case of DDR1, does the MD simulations reflect the peak distances (between 7.5 and 10.0 Å for DFG-in and between 16.0 and 18.0 Å for DFG-out) observed for AF2 distance distributions? Also, the probability distribution shift towards shorter distances for Y755A does not seem particularly strong at first glance. Is this why the double alanine mutant was included? Are there also MD simulations of the double mutant that show a reduced preference for the DFG-out conformation? 3. The overall results on EGFR mutants are striking. Many of these mutants (most notably L858R have structures deposited in the PDB (ID:2ITT and many others) that are potentially part of the overall training of AF2/OpenFold. Can you comment on how this might affect the results? Minor Points: 1. There is some ambiguity in the statement, “The central hypothesis of this manuscript is that the collective contact distance distributions predicted by AF2 contain relevant information that can approximate Boltzmann distributions provided the relevant conformational states can be adequately described by these contact distances.” We suggest adding to this such that a stronger connection is formed between the theory section and the remainder of the paper. For example, the authors could explain that the contact distances specified in each section are the set of CVs you describe earlier, “we identify a set of CVs, ξ = (ξ1, ξ2, …, ξm)...”. It would also be helpful to clarify that the distributions predicted by AF2 represent the ensemble averaged observable, as described by equation 4. Lastly, the authors mention that these distributions can approximate Boltzmann distributions, but this is somewhat vague. This could be reworded to say that AF2 distributions can approximate experimentally derived Boltzmann distributions of the same distance. 2. The authors are comparing  Cβ–Cβ distances determined by AF2 to spin label distances from EPR. This is explained in the methods section, but the procedure for adjusting the spin label distances to facilitate a meaningful comparison between them and the AF2 distances is somewhat unclear. To make a stronger justification for why these are comparable, the authors could clarify the procedure. For example, some context from the authors’ previous paper, De Novo High-Resolution Protein Structure Determination from Sparse Spin labeling EPR Data: “[distance from spin label] dSL is a starting point for the upper estimate of dCβ, and subtracting the effective distance of 6Å twice from dSL gives a starting point for the lower estimate of dCβ” could be beneficial. Including a rank correlation coefficient, as hinted above, could also help emphasize that the results demonstrate “similar relative probabilities among the contact distances for AF2 and EPR” 3. In the comparison of distance distributions between AF2 predictions and EPR measures, the major peaks of the two distributions are similar but in certain cases (127CB - 154CB, 120CB - 131CB), some additional peaks are found beyond 10A. A statistical comparison of the distributions, perhaps using a KS test, will help in evaluating the significance of the similarities. 4. Typo in Hamiltonian Equation 1 (should be momentum squared) 5. In the T4 Lysozyme example, how were the six contacts between the 12 unique residues found? 6. In Figure 5, the fourth row could have more discussion/explanation. What does the colorbar represent? There is no label. 7. As mentioned earlier, the connection between the Discussion and Figure 7 is not well established. The authors could expand on their writing and/or make the figure more simplified to match the discussion better. -  Jessica Flowers, Angelica Lam, Ashraya Ravikumar, James Fraser",2023-10-27T15:59:31,ashrayaravikumar,Ashraya Ravikumar,10.1101/2023.08.06.552168,Approximating conformational Boltzmann distributions with AlphaFold2 predictions,"Benjamin P.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.28.560070v1#comment-6309587919,biorxivstage,1,"Dear authors, Overall, I felt your paper was interesting to read and highly relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These findings could be extremely valuable for identifying preventive measures for mitigating disease transmission, and I thought the experimental question addressed by your paper and the experimental design –incorporating a PSV entry assay and a syncytia formation assay– was cohesive. However, when reading and presenting at a journal club, some questions and comments came up that I would like to share with you. First off, I would like to point out a few simple fixes that I found. For one, Figure 4 is titled “Effect of turmeric extract and curcumin on PSV entry in 293/ACE2 cells,” however, the experimental results exhibited in Figure 4 only deal with curcumin, so I feel renaming that figure would be more accurate. Additionally, I’m curious as to why in Figure 4b, the PSV entry assay treatment conditions included the following: non-treated 30 mins/SARS-CoV-2 16-18h curcumin 30 mins/SARS-CoV-2 16-18h curcumin 30 mins/SARS-CoV-2+curcumin 16-18h but did not account for the effect of non-treated 30 mins/SARS-CoV-2+curcumin 16-18h? I was curious as to the logic for excluding that particular treatment combination, which I feel could’ve been a good control for comparing the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-2/curcumin without the additional variable/impact of the initial 30 min treatment. As a side note, it might be beneficial to readers to make more clear, what is meant by “curcumin pre-treatment”; does that refer to the 30 min “black arrow” segment, or the 16-18h “gray arrow” segment in which the virus has a “+ curcumin” label? One final thing I want to point out is the use of statistics in this paper. You state that a t-test is used throughout, however, I believe that an ANOVA might be more effective here, not only to reduce the number of tests you have to run on the data (and therefore reduce the risk of making a Type I error), but also so that you can show the readers comparisons between each and every group, and not just between each individual group and the control. Additionally, it would be helpful if there were asterisks or “n.s.” consistently shown for every statistic (for example, this is done on Figure 5b, but not Figure 4d), along with a key on every graph indicating the significance levels indicated by each asterisk, to help clear up some confusion about interpreting significance and statistics. Going back to the Figure 4 example, in the paper, it is stated that, “The results indicated that curcumin reduced PSV entry, especially for curcumin pretreatment before the addition of PSV (P = 0.035)” in reference to Figure 4d; however, in the actual graph, there isn’t sufficient statistical representation to confirm this conclusion (no statistics are shown for comparing Cur 1uM and the control) and additionally, I had a hard time determining what defined the pre-treatment when flipping between Figures 4b and 4d. Ultimately, I feel the paper is a great start and could mainly benefit from a few changes to encourage more clarity surrounding the ways in which different treatments were defined, the labeling and annotation of figures, and display/application of statistical tests. I look forward to following it through pre-print.",2023-10-26T22:50:15,elsacouvillon,ELSA COUVILLON,10.1101/2023.09.28.560070,Curcumin and turmeric extract inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus cell entry and Spike mediated cell fusion,"Endah Puji Septisetyani, Dinda Lestari, Komang Alit Paramitasari, Pekik Wiji Prasetyaningrum, Ria Fajarwati Kastian, Adi Santoso, Kartini Eriani",2023-09-29

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.20.563351v1#comment-6309572510,biorxivstage,2,"is manuscript by Pla et al is focused on functional and structural characterization of the Prox1+ meningeal sublayer of the arachnoid, a follow-up on their prior work published in Jan, 2023 ( https://cell.science.org/do.... The authors refer to this layer as ‘subarachnoid lymphatic-like membrane’ or SLYM. For the purposes of this commentary/review, I will use the term Prox1+ sublayer or Prox1+ cells, in line with their work and the work of others showing expression of Prox1 is a defining characteristic of the subtype of meningeal fibroblasts that makes up the inner arachnoid sublayer. The model put forward in their prior work and seek to support with additional data in this manuscript is that the Prox1+ sublayer creates a space within the meninges, a bifurcation of the traditional and well-characterized subarachnoid space, that restricts CSF to support ‘unidirectional glymphatic CSF transport’. This has been called into question by post-review comments by several scientists that study the meninges, including me, and three recent papers that provide evidence from prior work and new data that support that the Prox-1+ cells is part of the sublayer of the arachnoid called the inner arachnoid [referred in prior literature as the ‘arachnoid reticular layer’, ﻿’inner layer arachnoid membrane’, ‘external arachnoid’, ‘arachnoid reticular layer’.]  I do appreciate that the authors in their discussion indicate the SLYM is the same as the inner arachnoid (aka arachnoid reticular layer), this has been raised as a point by me and others. It is helpful to give readers both in and an outside the field context for our sometimes ‘lively’ discussions on this topic. This manuscript is extending some of their prior work, including using new markers recently identified by molecular profiling of the meninges, Dpp4 that is enriched in arachnoid barrier cells by comparison to other cells in the leptomeninges. However, there are several points that need to be clarified and I have concerns about data interpretation. Figure 1 and Discussion Pg 10: The authors suggest that tissue shrinkage could cause artificial ‘cohesion’ of the arachnoid barrier cell (AB cell) layer with the inner arachnoid that contains Prox1+ cells, giving the appearing in fixed tissue and in electron microscopy (EM). How do the authors account for the description of cell-cell junctions (gap junctions, desmosomes) between AB cells and inner arachnoid cells in numerous species? This is not just in EM, the genes for gap junctions are highly expressed in arachnoid cells. These cell-cell junctions had to be created in a live animal or human between cells that are in close enough proximity for the cells to touch. The two papers they cite as support for their model (Nabeshima et al., 1974 and Vandenabeele et al., 1996) both describe these contacts in detail, as do many other papers. One way to address this in a comprehensive way would be to perform EM on Prox1-GFP animals, use immunogold to label GFP and look for presence of absence of cell-cell junctions between AB cell and Prox1+ cells at different regions of the meninges (dorsal, ventral along the A-P axis). Another option, though more challenging, the authors could use proximity ligation approaches or Bio-ID to probe protein-protein interaction between cell surface molecules differentially expressed by AB cell and inner arachnoid Prox1+ cells; this will allow them to observe after tissue shrinkage how close AB cell and inner arachnoid sublayers are in live animals. At this point, showing that brain tissue shrinks is insufficient evidence to claim that AB cell-Prox1+ sublayer positioning is an artifact of fixation and tissue shrinkage, particularly considering other data that supports these cells are adhered to each other in a live animal. Figure 2: The authors suggest that Figure 2 data supports their model that the Prox1+ layer forms a continuous, barrier forming layer that defines the perivascular space or lower subarachnoid space. However, I have concerns with their experimental design & interpretation. They use intracisterna tracer injection of Evan’s Blue or BSA-647, remove the brain from the calvaria and do fluorescent macroscopic imaging of the brain, fix the tissue and then stain it with antibodies to Dpp4, a protein that is enriched in arachnoid barrier cells by comparison to other leptomeningeal fibroblasts (Pietta et al., 2023). They go on to show imaging of Prox1-GFP, Dpp4 using confocal and 2-photon imaging of the calvaria with dura attached and the brain. They claim that Dpp4 signal (using this for arachnoid barrier cells) is only in the ‘dura’ attached to skull and not on the brain surface. They conclude that this means that the arachnoid barrier remains attached to the dura, cleanly removed from the leptomeninges, leaving an intact Prox1+ layer sitting above the vasculature and perivascular spaces. In all my years doing brain/meninges dissection, including some of the same methods described here, all the papers I have read on the leptomeninges staining with E-cad or other AB markers I have never observed that the arachnoid barrier layer comes off with the dorsal calvaria/dura in mouse dissections in the manner they claim to observe. Some minor perturbation where the dura/AB does not separate cleanly but nothing like what they describe Fig. 2D. Possibly, enzymatic digestion methods or dissection method could be applied to force separation of the AB cell from the inner arachnoid/pia/vasculature. In reading the methods I don’t see evidence that this was performed. First, I notice there is a weak Dpp4 signal on the brain in their images, far weaker by comparison to the imaging of the dura/calvarium. AB cells are very thin so this is not surprising. I suspect they kept the laser/gain settings the same in imaging the brain and the dura/calvaria, the later has a comparatively brighter signal. An alternate approach is to vibratome section the fixed brains and perform antibody labeling, this would permit higher resolution imaging. I recommend they add better validated and more specific markers of arachnoid barrier cells, like E-cadherin. This would be more rigorous approach to testing for presence or absence of the arachnoid barrier in the brain preparations. Another area of concern is in their interpretation of the Dpp4 signal in their dura/calvarium imaging. They conclude it is coming from AB cells, thinking that it is a specific marker of AB cells. It is, but only by comparison to other fibroblasts in the leptomeninges. The authors should consider that Dpp4 is expressed by other, non-fibroblast cells types in the dura and calvarium. Dpp4 is expressed in a lot tissues, including many immune cells subtypes present in the dura and in osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are found all over the surface of the calvaria and skull base, degrading and remodeling bone. This raises the possibility of the alternate interpretation that the Dpp4 signal they see in the imaging of the dura/calvaria is not in a continuous sheet of AB cells but rather from non-fibroblasts cells in the calvarium that express Dpp4. This is straightforward for the authors to test. They can remove the dura from the calvaria and stain it separately for Dpp4 or separate them post staining, image separately. Alternatively, they can immunolabel cryosections of de-calcified dura/calvaria for specific markers like E-cadherin. This would permit the authors to specifically identify where the E-cadherin+ AB layer is in their preparations. There may be fragments of E-cad in the dura/calvaria sections, but not the continuous layer they show in Fig. 2D. This would match all data that I am aware of, our own findings and their own data in the Science paper from January, specifically Fig. 4E. This data underlies their claim of functional data that the Prox1 layer alone retains the tracer in the lower SAS, the ‘upper SAS’ is lost in the dissection. If the authors find E-cadherin+/Dpp4+ cells on the brain surface, above the Prox1+ layer, this would support the more common model: the SAS as a single space in the cerebral meninges, the inner arachnoid (which contains Prox1+ cells, along with Prox1- cells) forms the ‘roof’ of the SAS and the closely adhered arachnoid barrier layer is the functional barrier Figures 3-7 use paraffin sections of brain preserved (thought substantially shrunk) in the skull. This has the advantage that is allows for visualization of the intact meninges (pia, arachnoid, dura).  The authors use several markers to visualize the meninges in a few different areas. They do show separations of the of the Prox1+ layer from AB cell layer in the ventral part of the brain. This is an interesting observation however it remains to be seen if these separations are happening due to tissue shrinkage, artificially separating layers that are normally in either very close proximity or attached, though with weak cell-cell connections such as gap junctions and desmosomes. The functional relevance of these spaces is not clear. That the Prox1+ cell layer stays continuous when separate from the AB in those basal regions is consistent with the presence of adherens junctions, extensive collagen and other ECM and other junctions between these cells – these cellular features would be permissive to this remaining a continuous sublayer, independent of the AB layer. But Prox1+ cells lack the canonical tight junction complex genes and proteins to make it be a barrier to solutes, so that remains a limitation for any claims of barrier properties. Also, since these spaces are likely artificial some of the experiments proposed in reference to Figure 1 would help to resolve these issues and help us to understand if in specific regions, meningeal layers are organized in a specialized manner to support CSF flow. Independent of this study, I also suggest the authors move away from single markers on adjacent section and instead adopt fluorescent in situ hybridization or multiplex antibody labeling with fluorescent detection that allows multiple rounds of antibody labeling on the same section. For example, it would have aided in interpretation of Figure 3, magenta box that is a high magnification image showing Prox1-GFP signal but with numerous associated nulcei without signal. It I understand the orientation correctly (this is a high mag of ventral meninges – green box), those cells are on the outer part of the arachnoid, the position of AB cell. If the authors used multiple probes or antibody for different cell types on the same section, the identity of these cells would notbe an unknown to the reader. Fig. 7 – the authors show an image of a ventral area, in the region that contains the circle of Willis, that shows there is no Claudin-11/E-cad signal in the meninges near the brain surface, is there no AB cell layer here? I looked at the Allan Brain Atlas sagittal sections in situ for Cldn11 ( https://mouse.brain-map.org... and Cdh1 ( https://mouse.brain-map.org... and in that same brain region and there is a clear signal. What happened to the AB cells in their sections? Is there also separation and the AB signal is not in the image? Fig. 8: I agree that studying prior literature on the meninges, putting their new observations into a historical perspective is important. I fully support this approach. However, I do not agree with their interpretation of the graphics in Nabeshima et al., 1974, reproduced in Orlin et al., 1991 nor do I understand their pseudocoloring in those images of the location of the Prox1+ layer. This could be because they are comparing the comparatively thin mouse leptomeninges with the much larger pig meninges. In the case of Nabeshima et al drawing, this is a graphical summary that, in my opinion, is not intended to reflect mouse meninges. That drawing is based on observations taken from multiple species and areas of the brain and spinal cord. As a result, I am unsure how practical or accurate it is to compare in vivo images to the graphical diagram. A better, more accurate, approach would be to compare their human leptomeninges data from the Science paper (Fig. 3) to Orlin et al. pig meninges, recognizing that the dura remains intact on the pig meninges image. Pig and human meninges are very similar, making this the best comparison with available data. From this readers can consider the following - How does the E-cad, Pdpn1+, Prox1+ signal match up with the section depicting the cellular organization pig meninges? Is the Prox1+ layer identified in human meninges located in the middle of the subarachnoid space as their pseudo-coloring suggests? For the mouse image with Prox1-GFP (cerebral meninges?) I suggest comparing this to EM of mouse cerebral meninges, there are three articles that I am aware of that have adult mouse cerebral leptomeninges EM ( https://doi.org/10.1002/cne... https://cell.cell.com/neuro.... The Pietila et al paper is probably the best because the inner arachnoid cells are molecularly defined as two similar fibroblast populations (Ppp1r1a/Prox1 vs Slc7a11), therefore the authors can use Prox1 expression and blood vessel to match their image with cells within the annotated EM in Figure 1 of Pietila et al. From this, readers can better evaluate the authors’ claims about the location of the Prox1 layer, structural and ultrastructural features using the blood vessel as a neutral reference point. From this, readers can consider the following - What do inner arachnoid cells look like? How are they connected to the arachnoid barrier cells? Is there a space or does the arachnoid appear as a single structure of interconnected cells? The more information readers have to evaluate the data, the better. Discussion: I disagree with the comment in Pg. 9 that a limitation of the Mapunda et al., 2023 study is the VE-cadherin-GFP labels a subpopulation of cells in the dura and therefore is not specific enough to draw any conclusions. The VE-cadherin-GFP does not label the dural fibroblasts, the authors of Mapunda et al. showed that in Figure 1E. It does label dural blood vessels, which is noted in Fig. Supp Fig. 1 and Fig. 6F - these are easy to distinguish in 2-P by the intravenous dye in these experiments. The expression of VE-cadherin-GFP in everything from the dural border cells (which are molecular different from the dural fibroblasts that populate the collagen rich dura that provide SHG signal) to the pia is actually advantageous. It shows the artifact separation of the dura from the dura border cells in the cranial window and skull thinning preps (Supp. Fig 1). This cleavage plane is what is depicted in their Fig. 8 reproduction and is described at length in Orlin et al., 1991 as the area that subdural injections of blood accumulate. Ideally, use of multiple transgenic mouse lines to independently label the layers and sublayers would be used in 2-P. However, as we await development and application of those tools, I believe the Mapunda et al., 2023 paper clearly shows that there is artifact separation of the arachnoid/pia and dura in commonly used imaging windows for 2-P.  This should be considered which interpreting meningeal spaces using this technique and new methods should be developed to avoid this artifact. With regard to the suggestion in their discussion that the term SLYM be used to identify the inner arachnoid cell sublayer as way to aid in study of meningeal layer function, I continue to disagree. This name in part refers to functional features, in particular that it is a mesothelium and has lymphatic-like properties that, in my opinion, remain in question and await further investigation. Also, the properties of the inner arachnoid, that it ‘handles’ CSF, interacts with immune cells and forms a continuous connected layer, these properties are also observed for pia and AB cells, though the details of these functional features are likely different. By choosing anatomic-positional names, that link it to the 3 traditional layer names that have been around for hundreds of years, we are not committing these cell types or layers to specific functional features. Also, defining these cells by their molecular markers, which we know far more about now, also will aid in identification across publications and in generation of new tools to functionally disrupt the meninges for experimental purposes. Finally, I agree with the authors that recognizing that the meninges have regionalized differences in organization is important. Some of this is already known, such has gaps in the E-cadherin+ AB layer as well as different arrangements of the meninges around the basal cisterns that the authors raise in their discussion. Thus, it is important that authors carefully define where their images and analysis are from (which these authors do a good job of) and also recognize that what is observed in one part of the brain or spinal cord may or may not hold true for other regions.  This comment can be extended to include inter-species comparisons, what may be true for mouse models awaits further validation in lower (zebrafish) and higher vertebrates (primate) on the evolutionary tree.",2023-10-26T22:21:36,,Julie Siegenthaler,10.1101/2023.10.20.563351,Structural characterization of SLYM - a 4th cranial meningeal membrane,"Virginia Plá, Styliani Bitsika, Michael Giannetto, Antonio Ladron-de-Guevara, Daniel Gahn Martinez, Yuki Mori, Maiken Nedergaard, Kjeld Møllgård",2023-10-23

I think this is very important for future research regarding T. cruzi and it's genome's contribution to Chagas disease. Sequencing this strain, whose whole genome has never been sequenced, is a significant contribution. Despite some limitations, this was done successfully and I think it will push others to work on sequencing genomes from other strains, particular those from field samples. I think this is a great step for further research in looking at the relation between transposable elements and multigene families. The methodology in this study was very convincing. I especially like the extra steps done to address the limitations of the Busco Score. I think comparing ORF length of assemblies from other strain with similar characteristics really helped improve your methodology. The paper had a logical flow, but I do believe limitations should have been further explained in the discussion. I think this would have really improved this paper. Overall, this was great work that opens up to more questions regarding this field which I hope this team or other researchers would look at in the future. Not only was a whole genome of this strain sequenced, but it was done using ONT nanopore sequence alone which can provide a less expensive method for sequencing T.cruzi genomes.  A few questions that came to mind was how different do you think your results would have been if you used ONT nanopore sequencing with supplementation of other technologies. Also how different would your results have been if you used a field isolated samples instead of a lab strain? Do you think you would have found a greater correlation between transposable elements and multigene families?",2023-10-25T00:53:17,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2023.07.27.550875,Whole Genome Assembly of a Hybrid Trypanosoma cruzi Strain Assembled with Nanopore Sequencing Alone,"Jill M.C.

Congratulations on the work. I notice that some discussions on dynamo are not accurate --unfortunately it has happened repetitively in the literature such as stating dynamo requires data with metabolic labeling only and the vector field gives only lear relation between a regulator and its target gene. Related to what discussed here,  with the dynamo vector field one can predict cell states NOT covered by the data. That is, dynamo is a generative model. So the criticism on using embedding is not justified. One uses low-dimensional manifold embedding (e.g. in Dynamo) to simplify the model (with reduced number of parameters to specify), and it is well-established that a dynamical system typically falls to a low-dimensional manifold after a transient period of time. A famous example is the 3-variable Lorenz  model.

It is really exciting to see that receiving both vaccines concurrently enhances the protectiveness of the COVID-19 booster. I have two questions: 1. Why is it that the group that received the two vaccines on different days were not administered the flu vaccine on the same number of days apart after the COVID vaccine? In the study it was stated that the flu shot just needed to be administered any time within 4 weeks from the time of the COVID booster. Could this have made the results more difficult to interpret? If you were to redo the study, do you think that the data would be more reliable if the second group all had the later flu shot administer on the same day, or does that not seem to matter? 2.

As the authors have acknowledged, we have never seen evidence in any of our studies of sexual dimorphism in adult presentation with disease or on cardiovascular imaging, either by echocardiography or cardiac MRI. We have seen young men and women suffer cardiovascular complications at similar age of onset in their 20s and 30s. 2. Changes in left atrial area, isovolumic relaxation time and ejection fraction without similar changes in myocardial performance index or global longitudinal strain worry me, as in humans I would expect both to be early indicators of restrictive cardiomyopathy. All of these values are affected by both acute changes in blood pressure (and especially during anaesthesia) and by the longer-term effects of hypertension, so this is an important confounder but again acknowledged. 3. One feature that is expected in human studies of restrictive cardiomyopathy would be corroborative evidence of pulmonary hypertension, occurring as a result of elevated LV end-diastolic pressure, high LA pressure and thereby pulmonary venous hypertension. Was there any TR in the mice model and any measure of TR maximal velocity? 4. I am an adult cardiovascular imaging specialist who practices both echo and CMR. I am only too aware of the variability of echo measures of cardiac function on an intra- and inter-observer basis. At heart rates of 350-450 BPM, I remain very concerned by the reproducibility in small numbers of animals - although I recognise these numbers are considered adequate in the animal physiology world. When I look at the box plots, there is often a wide spread of results, and no idea is given in the manuscript of the intra-observer measurement for example of ejection fraction - I understand that the person was measuring blind and was a single experienced sonographer...but in our practice, we recognise that in experienced hands, EF may vary in humans at up to 10% between scans at heart rates of 70BPM.",2023-10-23T08:13:46,,Richard Steeds,10.1101/2023.10.16.562570,Female Alms1-deficient mice develop echocardiographic features of adult but not infantile Alström Syndrome cardiomyopathy,"Eleanor J.

While the sentence you quoted from reference 14 does say that HDACs are generally associated with inactive genes, it's important to read it in context. Just two sentences later, the authors reveal their observation: ""Our data provide evidence that HATs and HDACs are both targeted to transcribed regions of active genes by phosphorylated RNA Pol II."" The presence of HDACs is a dynamic process. In active regions, HDACs and HATs often coexist in a dynamic equilibrium, influencing the acetylation status of histones. So while the action of histone deacetylation usually leads to gene repression, the presence/localization of HDAC itself is not necessarily an indicator of inactive genes. The last statement in the abstract of reference 14 also supports this: ""Silent genes without any H3K4 methylation signal show no evidence of being bound by HDACs."" In our study, we also observed a similar trend, where active marks correlate well with HDAC1/2/3 presence, further supporting this view. Does this answer your question?

The authors employed an interesting approach with restrictions on species dispersal in the models and the results contribute to predicting the effects of climate change in this biome. We see the importance of focusing on biotic changes and % of range loss, but it is our belief that adding the final predictions for each species in the supplementary material, in terms of maps and range shifts (direction of shift), it would be worth and informative because this information is important for managers and decision makers (those who manage conservation units but also to the researchers working on specific taxa). We also think that including a more detailed discussion about some species that have been modelled in other previous studies could enrich the work and make some of the results obtained here clearer. For example, why species with a wide distribution such as Callicebus barbarabrownae would lose their entire area of suitability in 2060? Other studies, such as Barreto et al. 2021 and Gouveia et al. 2016 found different results, could you attribute this to the methodological choices? We think the words used in the bibliographic review were not wide enough to include studies with mammals in the Caatinga because some important references are out of the included papers. The chosen words are mainly related to the biome or region. Maybe another approach would be to review occurrence records in a systematic way looking for articles with species names (as keyword) based on a preliminary list of mammals. Including latitude and longitude in the maps it would be more informative and including political division of states could help to subside discussion for specific regions of Caatinga. We wrote this comment during a meeting to discuss preprint papers that occurred by September, but I was able to post it just now. I saw that the paper was accepted yesterday, so I am not sure if our suggestions/questions will have some worth to the authors (feel free to reply or not), but we decided to contribute with them anyway. Many congratulations for your article! Although we think that some points could be different, we are sure that article is a nice contribution to understand potential effects of climate change in Caatinga :) Comment written at the Laboratório de Ecologia Vegetal, Evolução e Síntese (LEVES) at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, RN, Brasil.

We have addressed the latter issue by uploading our data download script, keggpuller.py, to the project Github.  This code was used to download molecule records from the KEGG database and store them in a commma-separated value format.  This resulted in 6669 records.  The dataset was then further processed to a simpler form to reduce each record to a SMILES string followed by a comma-separated list of letters indicating pathway class membership (this is smiles_property.txt).  We refer to this as the multi-class dataset.  We also considered the problem of classification of a compound as either being a member of a single, given pathway class or not.  We refer to the resulting dataset as the single-class dataset. The authors are correct that the resulting datasets contain duplicate entries.  The single-class dataset contains six duplicates out of 4545, while the multi-class dataset contains 1740 out of 6669. We have re-run our experiments on the datasets with duplicates removed.  The results for single-class classification did not change.  The table of results for multi-class classification can be found at this location. We note that the accuracies of most methods dropped, including ours.  The accuracy statistics for ensemble logistic regression increased. However, we also note that the central results of our paper remain intact -- the relative ordering of accuracy of different machine learning methods (other than ensemble logistic regression) on the data remains the same, and the superiority of our method over the others that we evaluated remains.  Indeed, this is expected because we ran all methods on the same datasets, using the same training/test split methodology. We have uploaded the de-duplicated datasets to the Github page.  The authors are correct to encourage the use of the de-duplicated datasets.  We will also post a correction to our paper.",2023-10-17T00:19:42,abrammagner,Abram Magner,10.1101/2023.10.03.560711,A cautionary tale about properly vetting datasets used in supervised learning predicting metabolic pathway involvement,"Erik D.
