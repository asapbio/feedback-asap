I have a technical question regarding the insertion of the targeting sequences into the provirus. I see that you transformed the library into DH5alpha E. coli (or, well, NEB's version of it). In my experience, even when grown at 30C, proviral plasmids grown in this strain (as well as in NEB10beta) can exhibit LTR-LTR recombination, resulting in a heavily truncated form of the plasmid that excludes the entire provirus but retains the antibiotic resistance gene, which grows competitively against the full-length plasmid. The result of these recombination events is that you end up isolating what might look like ""good plasmid"" in terms of DNA yield, but actually makes very poor virus stocks as the majority of the plasmid in the prep does not even contain the proviral sequence. These recombination events can be monitored by simply running the uncut plasmids on a gel and looking for a prominent band around ~3 kb (corresponding to the supercoiled form of the truncated plasmid which should be ~5 kb in length). Long-read (e.g. Nanopore) whole-plasmid sequencing is another great way to detect and quantify the frequency of these recombination events. Switching to NEB Stable E. coli (also grown at 30C) is a fantastic way to reduce the frequency of LTR-LTR recombination. You did a great job dealing with the repetitive sequences in nef to prevent those smaller recombination events, but I am wondering if you have looked for any such LTR-LTR recombination events that would happen already in the E. coli transformants, and if so, do you know how frequent they might be?

We are very happy that you enjoyed the read! I think the preprint club in your lab is a great initiative! As our manuscript was under review and ultimately accepted in the meantime ( https://rdcu.be/drgAc), we did not manage to address all the issues you mentioned for the peer-reviewed version. With respect to PC vs NMDS: we have adopted the method of doing both analysis since PC plots are limited to two variables in each iteration and this can cause statistical limitations with smaller sample sizes (as is the case here). NMDS collapses the variability to two dimensions and does not assume normal distribution. We use these two analyses in a complementary manner (one does not influence the outcome of the other, they are two independent methods). As our interest here was limited to inspect if the data is powerful enough to distinguish expression patterns at the respective time points, we did not focus on further discussion of these tests. With respect to identifying secreted proteins, we used SignalP5 and TMHMM to identify candidate secreted soluble proteins. This was only mentioned int he methods section and we could have added this in the results section, as well. We used the pipeline detailed in Figure 4 to identify the transcripts as noncoding. The tool CPC with a cutoff of an ORF length of 200 bp was used for that. Once again, thank you for your feedback!

Superb imaging throughout. The evidence for 2 mechanistically distinct regimes of PC2-EV release is persuasive. Minor point: I was less convinced by the evidence of ciliary localization of the ∆4-desaturase. The signals are very weak in cilia. A few more images with increased contrast would help. The images in 4C and the counting in 4D suggest that the enzyme is required for both regimes. Could the differences I eyeballed com to significance when more data points are included? The major point has to do with the interpretation that the contact between the worm and bare glass generates a mechanical perturbation. If neither clear nor dense core vesicles are required for glass exposure to trigger PC2-EV release form the tip, then we could only see two surviving  hypothesis: HYP1- the PC2-EV releasing cilia are intrinsically mechanosensitive.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.16.562535v1#comment-6323389801,biorxivstage,0,"Congratulations on this provocative paper which I read with great interest. However, I have some questions about the meaning of the results. Your paper suggests that previously, the prevailing belief has been that there is more hybridization, and therefore more gene flow between species, in plants than in animals. However, your preliminary discussion suggests that this is actually an artefact of “rely[ing] on morphological traits to arbitrarily define species (16),” where ref. 16 is Mallet 2005 in TREE. Although it is true that the data summarized in Mallet 2005 was indeed based largely on morphologically identified species (and their hybrids), it doesn’t rely on a morphological species concept. Anyone who knows taxonomy of any group of organisms knows also that morphology is a rather good, although not foolproof, guide to species status; two sister species, when they co-occur in sympatry, will typically display two modes in multivariate morphospace. Actually, Mallet in 1995 and 2005 argues for a genotypic cluster definition of species, which certainly applies to molecular markers as well as morphology. Two related species, if they co-occur in sympatry, will display a series of genetic differences that enables them to be identified, even if they hybridize. There are two modes in the multivariate genotypic distribution; the relationship with the classical taxonomist’s morphological identification of species is clear. Then you argue “the emergence of molecular data ... enables substituting the human-made species concept with genetic clusters that quantitatively vary in their level of genetic distance (18),” where ref. 18 is Galtier 2019 in Evolutionary Applications. Now that is interesting, as I think Galtier proposes “Species are defined as entities sufficiently diverged such that gene flow (arrows) is very rare or inexistent” (his Fig. 1). In other words, he appears to have a species concept such that gene flow between species is zero. Any gene flow, he argues, would render the situation “ambiguous”. Later, perhaps recognizing that this is too extreme, Galtier proposes using a reference species based system: “...to identify taxa in which large amounts of data are available, and species boundaries are consensual, or can be agreed on. Species delineation in any other taxon could thus be achieved so as to maximize consistency with the reference [taxa].” Now perhaps this dickering about what is a species appears rather unreasonable, since I think we all know (and Nicolas Galtier certainly seems to agree) that there is a continuum between populations that are not species and those that are species. However, in order to disprove the prevailing narrative that plant species hybridize more than animal species, you really must take a stance on what you mean by a species, and what you mean by a population that is not a species. My natural history knowledge of flowering plants and animals such as insects and birds suggests that plant species that co-occur in sympatry really do have a higher rate of hybridization than animal species. Not only is a greater fraction of species involved, but when they do hybridize, there are usually a lot more hybrids. But you will say perhaps: “that is not really the question we attempt to answer.” And indeed it is not, so perhaps you should not have complained that that finding about whether species hybridize was an artefact, which you appear to do. The question you more attempt, I think, to answer is: “is introgression more common in plants than in animals for a given level of genetic divergence, DA?” Rather than a question about species, it seems to me you are asking a question here that is independent of what your (or the reader’s species) concept is (unless you argue that a species has a certain threshold level of genetic divergence). After arguing that “the Tree of Life” is “interrupted by species barriers that are progressively established in their genome as the divergence between evolutionary lineages increases,” you then argue that “The consequences of reproductive isolation can therefore be captured through the long-term effect of barriers on reducing introgressing introgression locally in the genomes, which provides a useful quantitative metric applicable to any organism (4).” Ref. 4 is Westram et al. (2022) J. Evol. Biol. “What is reproductive isolation?” Westram show that it’s actually very hard to measure overall reproductive isolation, RI, which they say is determined by the level of “effective migration” at neutral loci, or the fraction of the rate of neutral genes that actually establish (reduced due to species barriers) in the recipient population, me,  divided by the rate of “potential gene flow,” m, into the population caused by the potential for hybridization and backcrossing, or RI = 1 - me/m. Effective gene flow depends on where in the genome you measure it; in which direction you measure gene flow; whether populations are parapatric or sympatric; whether you want to measure it using an “organismal” or “genetic” focus (in Westram et al.’s terminology). Furthermore, it depends on who is measuring it and how. Everyone who measures it seems to have somewhat different measures of reproductive isolation (Sobel, J. M., & Chen, G. F. (2014). Unification of methods for estimating the strength of reproductive isolation. Evolution, 68, 1511–1522). It doesn’t provide a very useful comparative measure applicable at the whole species level at all. My colleague from Boston University and I conclude from perusing the lengthy discussions in Sobel & Chen and Westram et al. that measuring overall reproductive isolation is unlikely to be useful, and we would be better off just accepting that it is a vague heuristic which expresses something about species (Mallet, J., & Mullen, S.P. 2022. J. Evol. Biol. 35:1175-1182). In contrast, one can readily measure some of its many components, such as “hybrid inviability”, “assortative mating” and so on, and these remain useful and interesting at the whole species level and as comparative indicators. Again, it may seem a distraction that I am discussing what is reproductive isolation, but it seems important here, because you are using a measure of reproductive isolation, and then relating it to genetic distance. In Westram et al., the main concern was to develop an experimental measure of reproductive isolation. Westram et al cautioned against estimating reproductive isolation from sequence data, which is the method you employ here. Their reasoning is that sequence divergence is a consequence only of actual gene flow, me (after taking into account barriers to gene flow), and that there is no way of estimating “potential gene flow” from the same data. In the main part of the paper (e.g. the data points in Fig. 1A), there seems to be a non-continuous measure of reproductive isolation, such that “migration” has a value 1, whereas “isolation” has a value zero. It was not entirely clear to me why this should be so, since, whatever it is, it seems clear to me that reproductive isolation should surely be a continuous parameter. Delving into the supplement, I found that “genetic isolation” was indicated “when our ABC framework yields a posterior probability P(migration) < 0.1304. This threshold was empirically determined by the robustness test conducted in (Ref. 6).” Similarly, the same robustness test yielded “strong statistical support for ongoing migration ... when the posterior probability P(migration) > 0.6419.” Pairs of taxa with intermediate posterior probabilities were considered “ambiguous” and were discarded.  Note that P(migration) is not the actual mixing rate of the populations, me, or the fraction of the genome exchanged, but, if I understand it correctly, the posterior probability that any gene flow at all occurs. This is a very different measure of reproductive isolation from that proposed by Sobel et al. or Westram et al., or anyone else. I think the reason for your choice of a measure of reproductive isolation is indicated by the second question you ask in the introduction: “At what level of molecular divergence do species become fully isolated?” This is related to a common conception of species as irreversibly independent lineages, and the idea that speciation will be “complete” when gene flow becomes zero. But in fact, the “completion” of speciation in this sense seems rather unlikely. The progressive loss of compatibility between diverging lineages seems likely to follow some sort of continuous probabilistic failure law, similar to the way lightbulbs fail over time. The simplest failure law is log-linear with time, although more complex models such as the accelerating “snowball” model of hybrid incompatibility, or the likely “slowdown” model for selective reinforcement, are also possible (Gourbière, S., & Mallet, J. 2010. Are species real? The shape of the species boundary with exponential failure, reinforcement, and the ""missing snowball"". Evolution 64:1-24); but all have a long asymptotic tail. You seem to recognize this stretched out right-hand side timescale by plotting genetic divergence on a log scale in Fig. 1 (although why is “net divergence,” Nei’s DA, the correct scale on which to base such an analysis? You do not explain or justify this). Nonetheless, by making an argument for complete isolation as an endpoint, you ignore the asymptotic nature of compatibility decline to zero. Based on the data we analyzed, it is rather hard to estimate the shape of the failure curve, mainly because the accumulation of incompatibilities is so variable, even among closely related species, such as Drosophila fruit-flies, for example. This variability between pairs of species shows up only in the data, and not in the fitted curve in Fig. 1A, but is more evident from Fig. 1B. Overall, I remain somewhat unconvinced that plants have a more rapid accumulation of species barriers than animals. I agree it is likely that many plants have “less efficient dispersal modalities” than most mobile animals, and that this might mean that actual gene flow becomes lower for plants at a distance from one another, but this is a little different from what I think one would mean by “species barriers.” Reproductive isolation and species barriers should generally be rather independent of geography; in other words reproductive isolation at close range is what we are primarily interested in. This is the problem of using a measure of reproductive isolation that depends purely on actual gene flow. I therefore remain unconvinced that my natural history observations of many plant hybrids in nature, and very few animal hybrids, are not reliable indicators of lower levels of reproductive isolation among plants than among animal species.",2023-11-14T16:49:20,james_mallet,James Mallet,10.1101/2023.10.16.562535,Rapid establishment of species barriers in plants compared to animals,"François Monnet, Zoé Postel, Pascal Touzet, Christelle Fraïsse, Yves Van de Peer, Xavier Vekemans, Camille Roux",2023-10-20

Understanding the role of TAMs in preserving OvCSC presence serves an important purpose in identifying how to improve treatment responses to cancer patients. Here are some general comments I had on the statistics and figures in your paper. 1.	Within Figure 3 (ex: 3B) you utilized medians as markers within your data, while earlier data utilized means. While both are proper statistical measures, the inconsistency in how the data is represented may be a little confusing for the readers. To improve coherence in their data, I would utilize either medians or means throughout the whole paper. Additionally, medians sometimes fail to note any skewness in the data. I think to further improve the representation of the data it may be a good idea to perform a Shapiro-Wilk test to determine the normality of the data. 2.	Within several figures, including 3F, there were very few samples within each treatment group. Since no power analyses were performed, it may be difficult to determine the true statistical significance of the data. To improve confidence in your findings, I would recommend performing power analyses and adding more samples/replicates in future research to further increase confidence in your data as necessary. 3.	Figure 1E indicates the percent survival of different cultured cells receiving different doses of treatments. Despite different cultures receiving different treatment doses, the points on the graph were connected making it difficult to decipher the differences between the samples. To increase clarity in the data, I would represent the data in the form of a bar graph or other similar form to better distinguish the differences between the samples.

We are only building distance trees, and while we've tested it on a broad range of input protein families from both CATH and OMA (which contains no viral proteins) in our benchmarking experiments we did not focus on viral proteins can indeed be very divergent. Since our treebuilding does not rely on a substitution matrix and makes almost no assumptions about the underlying model of evolution at the 3di and AA level, we can't really speak as to how well the alignments fed into a maximum likelihood treebuilding approach would behave. Since these models typically calculate the likelihood based on a substitution matrix that doesnt take structural features into account, this probably won't work very well. Using a custom substitution matrix like the one presented in the foldseek paper may help the problem, but the alignment from foldseek are made using both the AA and 3Di substitution matrices. Using this approach may still be insufficient.

We thought the findings suggesting that SETD1A may be driving the increase in H3K4me3 in MLL1 mutated cells (and possibly leukemic cells with MLL1 translocations) were very intriguing. However, we have several questions and suggestions: In figure 2B (metagene analysis) and C (pie charts), you plot the mean read counts from H3K4me3 ChIP-seq. We interpret the unexpected lack of enrichment of H3K4me3 at gene TSSs in the WT sample as a reflection of the relatively significant increase of H3K4me3 at new gene loci in the MT1 and MT2 cell lines. Is this correct? If so, we believe this point could be made stronger by adding, for example, a Venn diagram of the genes with MAC2 peaks in the WT cells and those with peaks in the MT1 and MT2 cells. You could also create two separate metagene plots based on the data in Figure 2B: one looking at H3K4me3 in all three cells lines at genes with MACS2 peaks in WT, and one looking at H3K4me3 at genes with MACS2 peaks in MT1+MT2. Given that there is likely variability in the chromatin state in different iPSC lines, we also wonder if you performed these experiments and/or analyses using a separate iPSC line? It is unclear how you performed the differential expression analyses in figures 3, 4, and 5. The heatmaps show changes in both the WT and the mutated cell lines, even though we assume the differential expression is in relation to the WT cells? We appreciate there are many ways to perform these analyses, however we would like to understand the details of how they were done here to better understand their implications.

The authors overlook the fact that the aromatic ring of tyrosine 90 is essential for the SH3 domain hydrophobic pocket structure. They incorrectly present the Src90E mutation as mimicking phosphorylated tyrosine, ignoring the expected disruptive effect of almost any mutation at this site. This flaw raises doubts about the validity of their interpretation, as the observed data may be a result of the grossly disrupted SH3 domain binding site rather than of simulating Tyr90 phosphorylation. 2. The study neglects the tightly regulated nature of Src kinase activity through phosphorylation by Csk. Previous research by Erpel et al. 1995 has demonstrated that the mutation of Tyr90 to alanine impairs the interaction with Csk and the negative regulation of Src kinase. As the mutations Src90E and Src90A are supposed to disrupt the SH3 domain binding pocket in essentially the same way, the authors fail to acknowledge this crucial aspect. This oversight undermines the study's reliability and suggests that the similarities observed between Src90E and Src527F may be solely due to the impaired interaction with Csk.

My only complaint is that it does not sufficiently cite previous work that reaches many of the same conclusions. Findings reported here that were previously published for Arabidopsis include the observation that sequences downstream of the TSS, in exons and introns, play a major role in controlling transcription (Rose and Gallegos, 2019, Scientific Reports 9:13777), that these sequences are unlike animal enhancers because they have no effect when moved upstream of the TSS (Rose, 2004, Plant Journal 40:744 and Gallegos and Rose, 2017, Plant Cell 29:843), that a motif containing the sequence GATC boosts expression in a dose-dependent manner and that mutating nucleotides within the GATC motif reduce its effect (Rose et al., 2016 Plant Molecular Biology 92:337). The Rose and Gallegos 2017 paper is cited but only as the reason for using the TRP1 promoter and for identifying the motif similar to GATC.

The toy figures at the beginning of the figures outlining the experimental overview are very useful.

For example, figure 1 states that Wilcoxon test or one-way ANOVA is used for comparison, but nothing indicates which analysis is used for which figure. Furthermore, when doing relative expression it is unclear what the expression is compared to, some graphs indicate it is relative to IRPL13a, but it looks like this is not true as in figure 2F the MFN2+/+ HEY1 and ID3 are both set to 1, suggesting that is what is being compared. The labeling of figures also makes it difficult to identify what is being compared, again in figure 2F it is unclear what the p values are indicating as they are over more than two groups.

However, in my eyes your algorithm does not get rid of the spillover signal. In Fig3C the correlated distribution is the result of spillover from channel Yb172 into Yb173, as can be seen nicely in Fig3D where this correlation vanishes with the same antibody labeled to a channel which Yb172 does not spill into (Sm147D). Instead your algorithm seems to only set low signals to NA. To undermine this point, Fig1a shows that the spill-in signal from Yb172 into the Yb173 channel  is on average 2.7. Assuming the the mean of Yb172 bead to be of similar strength as Yb173 (~6.2) then for a cell population without Yb173 we would expect a difference of roughly 3.5 (in log scale) between the two channels if purely driven by spillover.

The most sensitive methods used to detect low occupancy changes require crystallographic datasets to be isomorphous, which often limits their applicability. To address this limitation, the authors have developed MatchMaps, an pipeline that performs map subtraction in real space rather than reciprocal space, thereby eliminating the need for isomorphous data. The MatchMaps approach takes measured structure factor amplitudes from two states: the ON state (the interesting/ligand-bound/perturbed state) and the OFF state (the ground/apo/unperturbed state). Next, the algorithm performs rigid body refinement of the OFF state model (e.g. a model built/refined using only the OFF state data) using both the ON and OFF structure factor amplitudes. The electron density maps are then aligned by a rotation-translation matrix derived from alignment of the ON and OFF refined models. The authors apply MatchMaps to four different cases studies and where applicable, compare the results with isomorphous difference maps We tested the MatchMaps algorithm with some published datasets of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 macrodomain with ligand bound at 10-30% occupancy (​​ https://zenodo.org/records/..., ligand-bound datasets UCSF-P0628, UCSF-P2193, UCSF-P2227 and apo dataset UCSF-P0110) along with some unpublished data. The program is well documented and easy to install. With some generous help from the authors, we successfully used MatchMaps to reproduce ligand density observed in isomorphous difference maps calculated using the same datasets. The initial issue we encountered had to do with the default solvent mask, but this was overcome based on their advice. We also successfully ran matchmaps.ncs to calculate a difference map between the two macrodomain protomers in the P43 crystal form (chain A and B of apo dataset UCSF-P0110). Overall, the preprint is well written and the figures are clear and helpful. The major success of this work is the development of a method for the real-space subtraction of electron density maps to visualize structural changes between non-isomorphous datasets. This provides structural biologists with a powerful tool for visualizing structural differences between X-ray diffraction datasets and therefore will be of broad interest to the community. The major limitation is whether MatchMaps can be used to detect structural differences that are not detected using isomorphous difference maps, or to model structural differences that are not apparent by comparing refined coordinates. Although visualization is helpful, the real power in a tool such as this would be in its ability to detect and model low occupancy states. Major points The manuscript could be strengthened by including an example where MatchMaps detects a structural change that was not detected by calculating isomorphous difference maps or by comparing refined coordinates. The authors show how MatchMaps removes artifacts due to misaligned models (Figure 3g), but it is unclear to us whether MatchMaps can detect new structural changes. Put another way, it’s unclear to us whether structural changes that result in non-isomorphous datasets would be better visualized using MatchMaps versus a simple comparison of coordinates. MatchMaps produces two maps by default, one with a solvent mask applied and one without. We are curious why a map with a solvent mask is calculated. This mask is based on the OFF model, so any features of the difference map corresponding to structural changes outside of the solvent mask will be removed. If the solvent mask is required to remove noise in the MatchMaps generated maps, then it would be helpful to discuss this and give examples where the solvent mask was necessary (because this goes somewhat against the claim made by the authors that MatchMaps maps are less susceptible to “uninteresting signal” - line 215). The solvent masking also was a challenge for us in detecting some fragments, but was resolved by working through different options with the authors. An expanded discussion of the merits and limitations of solvent masking (and when to depart from defaults) is therefore likely to be helpful to many users. Do the authors envisage that MatchMaps could be used to model structural changes or just to visualize them? Along these lines, a comparison with the PanDDA algorithm might be helpful (Pearce, N. M. et al. 2017, Nature Communications). PanDDA can be used to both detect and model low occupancy states, but is most effective when data sets are isomorphous (so is typically used to detect and model low occupancy ligands obtained by soaking). Can the authors imagine an extension to MatchMaps where multiple datasets are averaged to create the OFF map in a similar way to PanDDA? Improving the signal-to-noise of the OFF map might remove the need for the solvent mask. Minor points Figure 3c/d. Can the authors comment on differences between the isomorphous difference map and the MatchMaps map? The density is similar but not identical. This is subjective, but to us the MatchMaps density looks a little noisier. Line 95. Are the data scaled with SCALEIT and then truncated (line 95)? Wouldn’t the reverse be more appropriate (e.g. truncation followed by scaling)? We were grateful for the -verbose flag in the command line, however, this only prints the output from SCALEIT/phenix.refine. Would it be possible to modify this flag to  print the output from all the programs? Line 104. How are the maps placed on a common scale? Figure 2f. Is there positive difference density associated with the terminal ribose (or the unmodeled nicotinamide) in the MatchMaps? It would be helpful if the figure legend indicated what part of the model the maps are contoured around. Line 350. The text says ±2.5 σ but the figure says ±1.5 σ.

As you may know, we have retrieved many bacteria strictly associated with AMF spores (after 15 washings). Actually, you performed a de-contamination of spores, with H2O2 and chloramine T, so you assumed that the retrieved bacteria were endobacteria. As our previous works described the occurrence of bacteria within the different layers of spore walls, I wonder whether they may have been protected from de-contaminating agents in such a peculiar niche.

The paper presents a transformer-based model called sc-translator and employed 31 cancer data sets for training and validation. Training is based on a 2-stage process. Stage 1 is training on bulk (pre-training) and Stage 2 is training on sc data sets. The model is based on favor+ which is a transformer attention mechanism Pre-training: In the isoforms prediction example, it seems that isoforms are predictive of each other e.g. CD49a and CD49b and not through model precision towards each isoforms. Correlation seems to be driven by a small number of data in the plot (Upper right portion of the correlation plot). Also, application on new dataset other than PBMC is warranted here to assess generalizability. Immune response is harder to predict: rare immune cells The application on new data showed that pre-training is very important, however it is not clear why cosine is used and not correlation as an evaluation metric. Downstream tasks: -   	More benchmarks on the attention interaction network are needed. It would be great to see a few examples of which genes regulate which proteins and their biological interpretations. -   	Pseudo-KO experiments also need to be benchmarked. There are many CRISPR knockout datasets which can be used for validation. Biological interpretation is missing for these experiments. -   	It would be nice to have a conduct GSEA in KO experiments -   	Finally for cell clustering (Figure 5a), it is likely that batch effects in true proteins are subpopulations for CD4 and not driven by batch. Potential future use: -   	It would be nice to predict protein levels in a different setting such as drug response for example. -   	Conduct more benchmarks for KO experiments beyond EGFR and TP53 Additional comments: -   	Lack of evaluation in a real-life setting without the presence of protein data that can be used to fine tune the model first -   	Would it be possible to build a model for each protein or protein class which seems to make more sense because post-translational modifications vary between proteins and therefore fitting a single model can overlook these differences.",2023-11-03T18:45:39,marouenbenguebila,Marouen Ben Guebila,10.1101/2023.07.04.547619,A pre-trained large generative model for translating single-cell transcriptome to proteome,"Linjing Liu, Wei Li, Ka-Chun Wong, Fan Yang, Jianhua Yao",2023-07-09

We will upload a revised version of this manuscript in a few months. eLife journal will publish the manuscript. 2) We agree with the reviewers that additional experiments are necessary for in-depth analyses of how elevated glycosuria increases compensatory glucose production. The goal of this project was to provide a foundation for future studies that will be informed by the list of secreted proteins identified using plasma proteomics, some of them may be correlative and others causal. At this time, it is not feasible to test each of the identified protein for its causal role in enhancing a compensatory glucose production. 3) eLife will publish a revised version of this manuscript in a few weeks.",2023-11-03T15:51:53,,Corresponding Author,10.1101/2023.09.01.555894,A kidney-hypothalamus axis promotes compensatory glucose production in response to glycosuria,"Tumininu S.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.06.552168v1#comment-6310058037,biorxivstage,1,"In this manuscript the authors have tested the hypothesis that the MSA constructed by AlphaFold2 (AF2) contains information about the distribution of different conformational states of a protein. Whereas the current way of thinking about AF2’s MSA-predicted Cβ–Cβ distance maps focuses on their power to provide binary classifications of inter-residue contacts, the authors propose that Cβ–Cβ distances should instead be thought of as a set of collective variables that approximate a Boltzmann distribution. This is a novel hypothesis that lends AF2 the ability to decipher the conformational Boltzmann distributions of proteins. The authors test this in the contexts of protein dynamics, mutation impacts, and protein-protein interactions. They start with analyzing the correlation between AF2 contact distance and spin label distance distributions obtained from EPR spectroscopy using T4 lysozyme as a model, finding a general agreement despite broader AF2 distributions. Following this, they explore if AF2 can approximate free energy changes in systems that contain multiple biologically important minima, using EGFR KD studies for this purpose. AF2 accurately identifies altered contact distance distributions corresponding to active or inactive conformations in several mutations, indicating a sensitivity to alterations that stabilize particular conformational states. Next, they assess sensitivity to thermodynamically destabilizing mutations. AF2 was able to predict different contact distance probabilities for disruptive mutations like L198R in UBA1, but was less sensitive for milder mutations like L198A. Lastly, AF2’s sensitivity to protein-protein interactions was explored using the μ-opioid receptor (μOR). Although the helix displacement distances observed in the predicted structure of isolated and complexed μOR do not exactly match with expected values, AF2 did successfully predict differences in select contact distance distributions of active/inactive-state μOR. Demonstrating that Cβ–Cβ distance probabilities from the same AF2-learned distribution reflect distances observed in differentially behaving domains of a protein lends strong support to the hypothesis that AF2 contact distance distributions can approximate conformational distributions. The manuscript explores the correlations and sensitivities of AF2 predicted Cβ–Cβ distances across a variety of protein contexts, giving a broad view of its capabilities and limitations. Transitions between the various sections flowed well, and overall the writing was well worded and easily comprehensible. In addition, the presentation was balanced. It doesn’t just focus on the success of AF2, but also highlights where its sensitivities might vary or fall short, providing a balanced view of its capabilities. Given limited computational resources, the conformational space explored by MD and MCMC simulations is limited by their initial states. AI methods are instead limited by how informative their system definitions (MSAs and pre-set theoretical or experimental contact distance distributions) are, allowing AI methods, such as the AF2 method outlined by the authors, to more effectively sample conformational space. This is a very fascinating implication of their work which the authors have briefly mentioned in the discussion. This (and the connection to Figure 7 in the paper) warrants a deeper discussion, but the main conclusions the authors come to are within the scope of the manuscript, and are backed up by the evidence presented. There are a few points we would like to bring to the attention of the authors to strengthen the manuscript further. Major points: 1.There are some difficulties interpreting Figure 2. (a) It is important to mark the distances between the two chosen pairs of atoms in the active and inactive state. Without this information, the purpose of Figure 2D is unclear and Figure 2D, F and G are difficult to understand. (b) What is the threshold distance to classify a state as active or inactive? (c) Figure 2E seems confusing with different axis and ranges. 2. In case of DDR1, does the MD simulations reflect the peak distances (between 7.5 and 10.0 Å for DFG-in and between 16.0 and 18.0 Å for DFG-out) observed for AF2 distance distributions? Also, the probability distribution shift towards shorter distances for Y755A does not seem particularly strong at first glance. Is this why the double alanine mutant was included? Are there also MD simulations of the double mutant that show a reduced preference for the DFG-out conformation? 3. The overall results on EGFR mutants are striking. Many of these mutants (most notably L858R have structures deposited in the PDB (ID:2ITT and many others) that are potentially part of the overall training of AF2/OpenFold. Can you comment on how this might affect the results? Minor Points: 1. There is some ambiguity in the statement, “The central hypothesis of this manuscript is that the collective contact distance distributions predicted by AF2 contain relevant information that can approximate Boltzmann distributions provided the relevant conformational states can be adequately described by these contact distances.” We suggest adding to this such that a stronger connection is formed between the theory section and the remainder of the paper. For example, the authors could explain that the contact distances specified in each section are the set of CVs you describe earlier, “we identify a set of CVs, ξ = (ξ1, ξ2, …, ξm)...”. It would also be helpful to clarify that the distributions predicted by AF2 represent the ensemble averaged observable, as described by equation 4. Lastly, the authors mention that these distributions can approximate Boltzmann distributions, but this is somewhat vague. This could be reworded to say that AF2 distributions can approximate experimentally derived Boltzmann distributions of the same distance. 2. The authors are comparing  Cβ–Cβ distances determined by AF2 to spin label distances from EPR. This is explained in the methods section, but the procedure for adjusting the spin label distances to facilitate a meaningful comparison between them and the AF2 distances is somewhat unclear. To make a stronger justification for why these are comparable, the authors could clarify the procedure. For example, some context from the authors’ previous paper, De Novo High-Resolution Protein Structure Determination from Sparse Spin labeling EPR Data: “[distance from spin label] dSL is a starting point for the upper estimate of dCβ, and subtracting the effective distance of 6Å twice from dSL gives a starting point for the lower estimate of dCβ” could be beneficial. Including a rank correlation coefficient, as hinted above, could also help emphasize that the results demonstrate “similar relative probabilities among the contact distances for AF2 and EPR” 3. In the comparison of distance distributions between AF2 predictions and EPR measures, the major peaks of the two distributions are similar but in certain cases (127CB - 154CB, 120CB - 131CB), some additional peaks are found beyond 10A. A statistical comparison of the distributions, perhaps using a KS test, will help in evaluating the significance of the similarities. 4. Typo in Hamiltonian Equation 1 (should be momentum squared) 5. In the T4 Lysozyme example, how were the six contacts between the 12 unique residues found? 6. In Figure 5, the fourth row could have more discussion/explanation. What does the colorbar represent? There is no label. 7. As mentioned earlier, the connection between the Discussion and Figure 7 is not well established. The authors could expand on their writing and/or make the figure more simplified to match the discussion better. -  Jessica Flowers, Angelica Lam, Ashraya Ravikumar, James Fraser",2023-10-27T15:59:31,ashrayaravikumar,Ashraya Ravikumar,10.1101/2023.08.06.552168,Approximating conformational Boltzmann distributions with AlphaFold2 predictions,"Benjamin P.

These findings could be extremely valuable for identifying preventive measures for mitigating disease transmission, and I thought the experimental question addressed by your paper and the experimental design –incorporating a PSV entry assay and a syncytia formation assay– was cohesive. However, when reading and presenting at a journal club, some questions and comments came up that I would like to share with you. First off, I would like to point out a few simple fixes that I found. For one, Figure 4 is titled “Effect of turmeric extract and curcumin on PSV entry in 293/ACE2 cells,” however, the experimental results exhibited in Figure 4 only deal with curcumin, so I feel renaming that figure would be more accurate. Additionally, I’m curious as to why in Figure 4b, the PSV entry assay treatment conditions included the following: non-treated 30 mins/SARS-CoV-2 16-18h curcumin 30 mins/SARS-CoV-2 16-18h curcumin 30 mins/SARS-CoV-2+curcumin 16-18h but did not account for the effect of non-treated 30 mins/SARS-CoV-2+curcumin 16-18h? I was curious as to the logic for excluding that particular treatment combination, which I feel could’ve been a good control for comparing the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-2/curcumin without the additional variable/impact of the initial 30 min treatment. As a side note, it might be beneficial to readers to make more clear, what is meant by “curcumin pre-treatment”; does that refer to the 30 min “black arrow” segment, or the 16-18h “gray arrow” segment in which the virus has a “+ curcumin” label? One final thing I want to point out is the use of statistics in this paper. You state that a t-test is used throughout, however, I believe that an ANOVA might be more effective here, not only to reduce the number of tests you have to run on the data (and therefore reduce the risk of making a Type I error), but also so that you can show the readers comparisons between each and every group, and not just between each individual group and the control. Additionally, it would be helpful if there were asterisks or “n.s.” consistently shown for every statistic (for example, this is done on Figure 5b, but not Figure 4d), along with a key on every graph indicating the significance levels indicated by each asterisk, to help clear up some confusion about interpreting significance and statistics. Going back to the Figure 4 example, in the paper, it is stated that, “The results indicated that curcumin reduced PSV entry, especially for curcumin pretreatment before the addition of PSV (P = 0.035)” in reference to Figure 4d; however, in the actual graph, there isn’t sufficient statistical representation to confirm this conclusion (no statistics are shown for comparing Cur 1uM and the control) and additionally, I had a hard time determining what defined the pre-treatment when flipping between Figures 4b and 4d. Ultimately, I feel the paper is a great start and could mainly benefit from a few changes to encourage more clarity surrounding the ways in which different treatments were defined, the labeling and annotation of figures, and display/application of statistical tests. I look forward to following it through pre-print.",2023-10-26T22:50:15,elsacouvillon,ELSA COUVILLON,10.1101/2023.09.28.560070,Curcumin and turmeric extract inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus cell entry and Spike mediated cell fusion,"Endah Puji Septisetyani, Dinda Lestari, Komang Alit Paramitasari, Pekik Wiji Prasetyaningrum, Ria Fajarwati Kastian, Adi Santoso, Kartini Eriani",2023-09-29

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.20.563351v1#comment-6309572510,biorxivstage,2,"is manuscript by Pla et al is focused on functional and structural characterization of the Prox1+ meningeal sublayer of the arachnoid, a follow-up on their prior work published in Jan, 2023 ( https://cell.science.org/do.... The authors refer to this layer as ‘subarachnoid lymphatic-like membrane’ or SLYM. For the purposes of this commentary/review, I will use the term Prox1+ sublayer or Prox1+ cells, in line with their work and the work of others showing expression of Prox1 is a defining characteristic of the subtype of meningeal fibroblasts that makes up the inner arachnoid sublayer. The model put forward in their prior work and seek to support with additional data in this manuscript is that the Prox1+ sublayer creates a space within the meninges, a bifurcation of the traditional and well-characterized subarachnoid space, that restricts CSF to support ‘unidirectional glymphatic CSF transport’. This has been called into question by post-review comments by several scientists that study the meninges, including me, and three recent papers that provide evidence from prior work and new data that support that the Prox-1+ cells is part of the sublayer of the arachnoid called the inner arachnoid [referred in prior literature as the ‘arachnoid reticular layer’, ﻿’inner layer arachnoid membrane’, ‘external arachnoid’, ‘arachnoid reticular layer’.]  I do appreciate that the authors in their discussion indicate the SLYM is the same as the inner arachnoid (aka arachnoid reticular layer), this has been raised as a point by me and others. It is helpful to give readers both in and an outside the field context for our sometimes ‘lively’ discussions on this topic. This manuscript is extending some of their prior work, including using new markers recently identified by molecular profiling of the meninges, Dpp4 that is enriched in arachnoid barrier cells by comparison to other cells in the leptomeninges. However, there are several points that need to be clarified and I have concerns about data interpretation. Figure 1 and Discussion Pg 10: The authors suggest that tissue shrinkage could cause artificial ‘cohesion’ of the arachnoid barrier cell (AB cell) layer with the inner arachnoid that contains Prox1+ cells, giving the appearing in fixed tissue and in electron microscopy (EM). How do the authors account for the description of cell-cell junctions (gap junctions, desmosomes) between AB cells and inner arachnoid cells in numerous species? This is not just in EM, the genes for gap junctions are highly expressed in arachnoid cells. These cell-cell junctions had to be created in a live animal or human between cells that are in close enough proximity for the cells to touch. The two papers they cite as support for their model (Nabeshima et al., 1974 and Vandenabeele et al., 1996) both describe these contacts in detail, as do many other papers. One way to address this in a comprehensive way would be to perform EM on Prox1-GFP animals, use immunogold to label GFP and look for presence of absence of cell-cell junctions between AB cell and Prox1+ cells at different regions of the meninges (dorsal, ventral along the A-P axis). Another option, though more challenging, the authors could use proximity ligation approaches or Bio-ID to probe protein-protein interaction between cell surface molecules differentially expressed by AB cell and inner arachnoid Prox1+ cells; this will allow them to observe after tissue shrinkage how close AB cell and inner arachnoid sublayers are in live animals. At this point, showing that brain tissue shrinks is insufficient evidence to claim that AB cell-Prox1+ sublayer positioning is an artifact of fixation and tissue shrinkage, particularly considering other data that supports these cells are adhered to each other in a live animal. Figure 2: The authors suggest that Figure 2 data supports their model that the Prox1+ layer forms a continuous, barrier forming layer that defines the perivascular space or lower subarachnoid space. However, I have concerns with their experimental design & interpretation. They use intracisterna tracer injection of Evan’s Blue or BSA-647, remove the brain from the calvaria and do fluorescent macroscopic imaging of the brain, fix the tissue and then stain it with antibodies to Dpp4, a protein that is enriched in arachnoid barrier cells by comparison to other leptomeningeal fibroblasts (Pietta et al., 2023). They go on to show imaging of Prox1-GFP, Dpp4 using confocal and 2-photon imaging of the calvaria with dura attached and the brain. They claim that Dpp4 signal (using this for arachnoid barrier cells) is only in the ‘dura’ attached to skull and not on the brain surface. They conclude that this means that the arachnoid barrier remains attached to the dura, cleanly removed from the leptomeninges, leaving an intact Prox1+ layer sitting above the vasculature and perivascular spaces. In all my years doing brain/meninges dissection, including some of the same methods described here, all the papers I have read on the leptomeninges staining with E-cad or other AB markers I have never observed that the arachnoid barrier layer comes off with the dorsal calvaria/dura in mouse dissections in the manner they claim to observe. Some minor perturbation where the dura/AB does not separate cleanly but nothing like what they describe Fig. 2D. Possibly, enzymatic digestion methods or dissection method could be applied to force separation of the AB cell from the inner arachnoid/pia/vasculature. In reading the methods I don’t see evidence that this was performed. First, I notice there is a weak Dpp4 signal on the brain in their images, far weaker by comparison to the imaging of the dura/calvarium. AB cells are very thin so this is not surprising. I suspect they kept the laser/gain settings the same in imaging the brain and the dura/calvaria, the later has a comparatively brighter signal. An alternate approach is to vibratome section the fixed brains and perform antibody labeling, this would permit higher resolution imaging. I recommend they add better validated and more specific markers of arachnoid barrier cells, like E-cadherin. This would be more rigorous approach to testing for presence or absence of the arachnoid barrier in the brain preparations. Another area of concern is in their interpretation of the Dpp4 signal in their dura/calvarium imaging. They conclude it is coming from AB cells, thinking that it is a specific marker of AB cells. It is, but only by comparison to other fibroblasts in the leptomeninges. The authors should consider that Dpp4 is expressed by other, non-fibroblast cells types in the dura and calvarium. Dpp4 is expressed in a lot tissues, including many immune cells subtypes present in the dura and in osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are found all over the surface of the calvaria and skull base, degrading and remodeling bone. This raises the possibility of the alternate interpretation that the Dpp4 signal they see in the imaging of the dura/calvaria is not in a continuous sheet of AB cells but rather from non-fibroblasts cells in the calvarium that express Dpp4. This is straightforward for the authors to test. They can remove the dura from the calvaria and stain it separately for Dpp4 or separate them post staining, image separately. Alternatively, they can immunolabel cryosections of de-calcified dura/calvaria for specific markers like E-cadherin. This would permit the authors to specifically identify where the E-cadherin+ AB layer is in their preparations. There may be fragments of E-cad in the dura/calvaria sections, but not the continuous layer they show in Fig. 2D. This would match all data that I am aware of, our own findings and their own data in the Science paper from January, specifically Fig. 4E. This data underlies their claim of functional data that the Prox1 layer alone retains the tracer in the lower SAS, the ‘upper SAS’ is lost in the dissection. If the authors find E-cadherin+/Dpp4+ cells on the brain surface, above the Prox1+ layer, this would support the more common model: the SAS as a single space in the cerebral meninges, the inner arachnoid (which contains Prox1+ cells, along with Prox1- cells) forms the ‘roof’ of the SAS and the closely adhered arachnoid barrier layer is the functional barrier Figures 3-7 use paraffin sections of brain preserved (thought substantially shrunk) in the skull. This has the advantage that is allows for visualization of the intact meninges (pia, arachnoid, dura).  The authors use several markers to visualize the meninges in a few different areas. They do show separations of the of the Prox1+ layer from AB cell layer in the ventral part of the brain. This is an interesting observation however it remains to be seen if these separations are happening due to tissue shrinkage, artificially separating layers that are normally in either very close proximity or attached, though with weak cell-cell connections such as gap junctions and desmosomes. The functional relevance of these spaces is not clear. That the Prox1+ cell layer stays continuous when separate from the AB in those basal regions is consistent with the presence of adherens junctions, extensive collagen and other ECM and other junctions between these cells – these cellular features would be permissive to this remaining a continuous sublayer, independent of the AB layer. But Prox1+ cells lack the canonical tight junction complex genes and proteins to make it be a barrier to solutes, so that remains a limitation for any claims of barrier properties. Also, since these spaces are likely artificial some of the experiments proposed in reference to Figure 1 would help to resolve these issues and help us to understand if in specific regions, meningeal layers are organized in a specialized manner to support CSF flow. Independent of this study, I also suggest the authors move away from single markers on adjacent section and instead adopt fluorescent in situ hybridization or multiplex antibody labeling with fluorescent detection that allows multiple rounds of antibody labeling on the same section. For example, it would have aided in interpretation of Figure 3, magenta box that is a high magnification image showing Prox1-GFP signal but with numerous associated nulcei without signal. It I understand the orientation correctly (this is a high mag of ventral meninges – green box), those cells are on the outer part of the arachnoid, the position of AB cell. If the authors used multiple probes or antibody for different cell types on the same section, the identity of these cells would notbe an unknown to the reader. Fig. 7 – the authors show an image of a ventral area, in the region that contains the circle of Willis, that shows there is no Claudin-11/E-cad signal in the meninges near the brain surface, is there no AB cell layer here? I looked at the Allan Brain Atlas sagittal sections in situ for Cldn11 ( https://mouse.brain-map.org... and Cdh1 ( https://mouse.brain-map.org... and in that same brain region and there is a clear signal. What happened to the AB cells in their sections? Is there also separation and the AB signal is not in the image? Fig. 8: I agree that studying prior literature on the meninges, putting their new observations into a historical perspective is important. I fully support this approach. However, I do not agree with their interpretation of the graphics in Nabeshima et al., 1974, reproduced in Orlin et al., 1991 nor do I understand their pseudocoloring in those images of the location of the Prox1+ layer. This could be because they are comparing the comparatively thin mouse leptomeninges with the much larger pig meninges. In the case of Nabeshima et al drawing, this is a graphical summary that, in my opinion, is not intended to reflect mouse meninges. That drawing is based on observations taken from multiple species and areas of the brain and spinal cord. As a result, I am unsure how practical or accurate it is to compare in vivo images to the graphical diagram. A better, more accurate, approach would be to compare their human leptomeninges data from the Science paper (Fig. 3) to Orlin et al. pig meninges, recognizing that the dura remains intact on the pig meninges image. Pig and human meninges are very similar, making this the best comparison with available data. From this readers can consider the following - How does the E-cad, Pdpn1+, Prox1+ signal match up with the section depicting the cellular organization pig meninges? Is the Prox1+ layer identified in human meninges located in the middle of the subarachnoid space as their pseudo-coloring suggests? For the mouse image with Prox1-GFP (cerebral meninges?) I suggest comparing this to EM of mouse cerebral meninges, there are three articles that I am aware of that have adult mouse cerebral leptomeninges EM ( https://doi.org/10.1002/cne... https://cell.cell.com/neuro.... The Pietila et al paper is probably the best because the inner arachnoid cells are molecularly defined as two similar fibroblast populations (Ppp1r1a/Prox1 vs Slc7a11), therefore the authors can use Prox1 expression and blood vessel to match their image with cells within the annotated EM in Figure 1 of Pietila et al. From this, readers can better evaluate the authors’ claims about the location of the Prox1 layer, structural and ultrastructural features using the blood vessel as a neutral reference point. From this, readers can consider the following - What do inner arachnoid cells look like? How are they connected to the arachnoid barrier cells? Is there a space or does the arachnoid appear as a single structure of interconnected cells? The more information readers have to evaluate the data, the better. Discussion: I disagree with the comment in Pg. 9 that a limitation of the Mapunda et al., 2023 study is the VE-cadherin-GFP labels a subpopulation of cells in the dura and therefore is not specific enough to draw any conclusions. The VE-cadherin-GFP does not label the dural fibroblasts, the authors of Mapunda et al. showed that in Figure 1E. It does label dural blood vessels, which is noted in Fig. Supp Fig. 1 and Fig. 6F - these are easy to distinguish in 2-P by the intravenous dye in these experiments. The expression of VE-cadherin-GFP in everything from the dural border cells (which are molecular different from the dural fibroblasts that populate the collagen rich dura that provide SHG signal) to the pia is actually advantageous. It shows the artifact separation of the dura from the dura border cells in the cranial window and skull thinning preps (Supp. Fig 1). This cleavage plane is what is depicted in their Fig. 8 reproduction and is described at length in Orlin et al., 1991 as the area that subdural injections of blood accumulate. Ideally, use of multiple transgenic mouse lines to independently label the layers and sublayers would be used in 2-P. However, as we await development and application of those tools, I believe the Mapunda et al., 2023 paper clearly shows that there is artifact separation of the arachnoid/pia and dura in commonly used imaging windows for 2-P.  This should be considered which interpreting meningeal spaces using this technique and new methods should be developed to avoid this artifact. With regard to the suggestion in their discussion that the term SLYM be used to identify the inner arachnoid cell sublayer as way to aid in study of meningeal layer function, I continue to disagree. This name in part refers to functional features, in particular that it is a mesothelium and has lymphatic-like properties that, in my opinion, remain in question and await further investigation. Also, the properties of the inner arachnoid, that it ‘handles’ CSF, interacts with immune cells and forms a continuous connected layer, these properties are also observed for pia and AB cells, though the details of these functional features are likely different. By choosing anatomic-positional names, that link it to the 3 traditional layer names that have been around for hundreds of years, we are not committing these cell types or layers to specific functional features. Also, defining these cells by their molecular markers, which we know far more about now, also will aid in identification across publications and in generation of new tools to functionally disrupt the meninges for experimental purposes. Finally, I agree with the authors that recognizing that the meninges have regionalized differences in organization is important. Some of this is already known, such has gaps in the E-cadherin+ AB layer as well as different arrangements of the meninges around the basal cisterns that the authors raise in their discussion. Thus, it is important that authors carefully define where their images and analysis are from (which these authors do a good job of) and also recognize that what is observed in one part of the brain or spinal cord may or may not hold true for other regions.  This comment can be extended to include inter-species comparisons, what may be true for mouse models awaits further validation in lower (zebrafish) and higher vertebrates (primate) on the evolutionary tree.",2023-10-26T22:21:36,,Julie Siegenthaler,10.1101/2023.10.20.563351,Structural characterization of SLYM - a 4th cranial meningeal membrane,"Virginia Plá, Styliani Bitsika, Michael Giannetto, Antonio Ladron-de-Guevara, Daniel Gahn Martinez, Yuki Mori, Maiken Nedergaard, Kjeld Møllgård",2023-10-23
