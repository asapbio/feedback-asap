For clarity, we also share the reviewer comments and our responses to that with you: Reviewer Comments: Reviewer 1 This is a very elaborate and interesting study proposing a dynamic genetic screen based on FRET-FLIM and which allows for a more refined understanding of the impact of gene knockouts on cellular signaling and metabolic processes compared to the simple cell viability and colony formation readouts widely used in the past (and also currently). The authors used an innovative FRET-FLIM sensor (created by them) expressed in stable cell lines to monitor changes in the levels of cyclic AMP by modulating phosphodiesterase-induced breakdown via treatment with silencing RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides. I only have a few comments regarding the text of the article, as follows. 1.	It is very difficult to understand from the abstract the purpose of the paper, at least from the standpoint of the general FRET enthusiast with no specific knowledge regarding the biological application described. (i) Specifically, in the second paragraph, the agonist of what receptor are the authors referring to? What is the connection between the” 22 different phosphodiesterases (PDEs)” and the baseline levels of cAMP. Is that what the sentence refers to? It is hard to guess from the current sentence structure. (ii) The authors used “HeLa cells stably expressing our FRET-FLIM sensor.” Precisely what sensor does “our” stand for? (iii) The rest of the paragraph does not seem much easier either, especially given the numerous undefined acronyms. All these questions are fully addressed in the body of the paper, though not in the abstract. The last 75% of the abstract has been completely rephrased to address hopefully all of the reviewers concerns. Changed part is indicated with track-changes. 2.	On page 3, the authors state: “FLIM is a robust and inherently quantitative method for FRET detection which requires no additional calibrations or correction parameters.” That is not entirely correct, for a couple of reasons: (i) FLIM generally requires separate knowledge of the donor lifetime in the absence of FRET. The reviewer is right. We condensed the text so much that we cut some corners. We have now rephrased that claim, and mentioned that the donor lifetime is a necessary calibration. See page 3. (ii) One has to fully separate the donor emission from acceptor emission, which is usually done achieved band-pass filters (it is also done, though not very often, using spectral resolution). This is not unlike what is done in intensity-based measurements, in which, at least one is attempting to unmix the donor and acceptor signals or at least apply some post-measurement corrections for bleed through (caused by spectral overlap between donor and acceptor emission). The fact that FLIM researchers often choose to ignore this kind of corrections may not be interpreted, in my view, as an advantage of FLIM. Please consider adjusting the text. We could not agree more!  In particular in view of our own contributions to obtain truly quantitative sensitized emission FRET (van Rheenen et al, BJ 2004), we are keenly aware of the dangers of spectral overlap. That is the reason that in this study we used our Epac-SH189 FRET sensor which has dark (i.e. non-emitting;  Y145W mutation; Klarenbeek et al, PLoSOne 2015 ) acceptors. Given the high QY of the donor, the lifetime of this sensor has ignorable contribution of acceptor emission even if a large spectral window is selected. We did not attempt unmixing approaches, because our pilots had indicated near-identical lifetimes when the emission was taken just from the part of the spectrum that is exclusively occupied by mTurquoise.  This information is presented towards the end of the introduction on page 5, in the paragraph where we present a more specific outlook to the contents. It has been rephrased in part for better emphasis. 3.	The results shown in Figures 6 and 7 are fascinating. To let the reader more easily follow the story, could the authors insert “agonist” or “antagonist” as necessary within the following sentences? “We first stimulated HeLa cells with 40 nM isoproterenol which caused a rapid rise in cAMP levels and subsequently added propranolol at 60 nM concentration which caused a sharp decline following the stimulation. Finally, 25 µM forskolin…” We have adapted the text (page 14) and legend of figure legends (page 15) according to these suggestions. Once again, in my evaluation, this is an excellent, detailed, and rich in information study worthy of publication in a high caliber journal. Reviewer 2 The manuscript submitted by Harkes et al. on the topic of FRET-FLIM HCS with siRNA screen to monitor dynamically the change of cAMP concentration using a FRET biosensor is well written with interesting results and shows the high potential of this method. In order to increase its impact and for clarification I have few queries: [1]  I found the introduction of interest but previous work in the scope of HCS FLIM is missing. I suggest to add references of several groups working in this direction (French, Tramier, Esposito...). In our introduction we sought to emphasize work that is geared towards screening of fast dynamic changes in lifetime in living cells, which implies imaging with very high photon fluxes and with methods that do not waste photons unnecessarily, so as to avoid unnecessary cell damage. We agree with the reviewer that this does not acknowledge much of the work of those who contributed to high-content and high-speed FLIM imaging, in particular from pioneers like Drs French, Tramier, Esposito, but also e.g.  Gerritsen, Ameer-Beg and others. We have now rewritten that part (page 4) and added 4 references to just a few of the very relevant contributions. [2] For lifetime analysis, authors have used biexponential fit with two fixed lifetimes 3.4 and 0.6 ns with a final determination of mean lifetime using the different preexpo factors. I'm not sure that this approach is the more appropriate. First, what means these two fixed lifetimes? is it pertinent with the biosensor under study? this is not really discussed in the manuscript. Second, if finally you use a mean parameter for the concentration curve fitting, why not using a mean analysis such as the mean arrival time? This parameter is now directly calculated in the FALCON version and seems pertinent because HyD have very low noise. From my point of view, this will increase the sensitivity and the speed of the measurement. In any case, this has to be discussed. In fact, we had given this quite a bit of thought but for brevity, it did not make it to the final draft. In brief, we performed 2-component fits because these fitted much better than single-component fits. The lifetimes of 3.4 and 0.6 ns were selected because these were the dominant components in large numbers of global (i.e. whole-image) fits. We expected a dominant component of 3.4 ns, which is that of the Epac sensor in its low-FRET configuration. The low lifetime, 0.6 ns, is in fact significantly below the resting-state lifetime of the cells (minimally 1.9 ns in some cells) but it is the second dominant Tau in the two component fits and the phasor analysis also indicates a intercept below 1 ns. Our data were thus collected and exported (data reduction) for those two components, enabling us to analyze both effects on long as well as on short lifetime contributions upon PDE knockdown. In preparing figures for the manuscript, we noted no clear advantage of separately presenting data of both lifetimes and their amplitudes, so we decided to extract the weighted mean lifetime. This has now been described more completely in the Methods section (page 6).  For the reviewer, we also note that we are not fond of using the FALCONs mean photon arrival time because 1st, unlike the fitting, it proved to be quite sensitive to environmental (background) light, and 2nd, there is a small bug in our version of the software which sometimes causes erroneously high lifetimes when recalculating old data with the ‘mean photon arrival time’ option. 3rd, this method has the same number of free fit parameters as a single component fit. We experienced that the result with this method had less pixel to pixel variation compared to a single component fit. [3] When showing screen results, only fitting parameters are presented in figures. Is it too difficult to present few curves in which differences can be shown? This will increase the understanding of the reader before to present the statistics. We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. Two panels have now been added to the boxplot in  Fig. 4 [4] From my point of view, details regarding how to add drugs in multi-well plate has to be presented. Is it pipeting ? and in this case it does not really make High Content automated approach. Moreover, how is managed the focus since probably you loose it during pipeting... or is it more automated device that you use in the context of multiwell plate. In addition, how is selected the FOV? how to manage the human choice? This has to be detailled and discussed. We have extended the text in Materials and Methods to cover all of these aspects, see page 6, 7. In brief, in this study we present only data from studies where stimulus addition and mixing where done manually, although we have also implemented automated addition of stimuli (3 channels). For the protocol involving rapid sequential agonist-antagonist stimulation we found that, at least with our equipment, automated addition of stimuli depended too much on diffusion, and therefore results were more variable than with manual mixing. For keeping in focus, we routinely used the Leica hardware  focusing option, AFC. One last important issue: in revising our manuscript, we noted that the reported sequences for siRNAs used for PDE8A accidentally had become mixed up. We now corrected those entries in Supplementary Table S1. This correction does not affect any of the experiments, microscopy data or interpretations whatsoever, it solely affects one row in that table. We expect that with those changes, we have adequately addressed all issues raised by the reviewers. We feel that the manuscript has significantly improved in the review process and we are indebted to both reviewers for their time and thoughtful comments.

Our article published earlier this year, in which we reached remarkably similar conclusions. Sin our paper is not quoted in yours, we wish to send you some comments about the similarities and differences. We find rather interes ting that from the use of Non Negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) applied to your experimental data you reached conclusions that are similar to ours, which were obtained with a stochastic approach applied to classic published data from neuromuscular junctions of frog and mammals. In brief, the similarities we find are: 1.	The differences in synaptic strength are not primarily caused by variable probability of fusion but determined by the fraction of matured release machinery of docked synaptic vesicles. 2.	Fusion reflects the resting distribution of mature and immature priming states. 3.	We both estimate the numbers or proportions of vesicles in different pre-fusion states. 4.	The values estimated for the forward resting rate constants for the vesicle priming are virtually the same in both studies. 5.	The forward rate constants in both studies are accelerated by calcium in an activity-dependent manner. 6.	In both papers we reach the conclusion only the forward rate constants are susceptible to change due to calcium. There are also some differences: 1.	You propose an additional parallel step to adjust the responses upon high stimulation frequencies. We do not require such step. 2.	You adjust your model to facilitation at low frequencies and depression at high frequencies. We find a coexistence of facilitation and depression using the same theoretical approach. In addition, our study suggests that: 1.	Spontaneous and asynchronous release can be expressed as spontaneous forward transitions from primed to fusion. 2.	In our study, the backward constants are much larger than the resting forward rate constants 3.	In our case, the recycling of the vesicle pool contributes to depression. although you don´t deal with it in your model, you have done extensive work on the matter. 4.	Your finest way to simulate calcium indicates that the calcium-dependence of the forward rate constant is linear; ours considers a non-linear dependence. In addition to intrinsic differences in the type of synapse studied in each paper, another major difference is the use of differential equations in your study versus the stochastic approach in ours. Yours allowed the numerical solution and a finer calculation of the calcium concentration. The stochastic approach allowed us to predict accurately two additional behaviors, which are absent from your study: spontaneous release and asynchronous release. Altogether, the common findings in our studies suggest that such sequential maturation process of the fusion machinery with certain adaptations may be common to different synapses. Therefore, we wish to invite you to read our paper and to quote it in your article. Needless to say that your recognition tour study will bring its general impact up immediately. In addition both our findings will strengthen each other. I wonder if exchanging each other´s data to be fitted with the different approaches will confirm general mechanisms and give light as to synaptic-specific ones. I would also like to ask you if a joint review would be of interest to you? As a brief introduction to myself, I contacted you some years ago when John Nicholls and I co-organized a pair of Royal Society meetings in 2015 on extrasynaptic release of transmitters, the topic in which I do most of my work. Our common friend Walter Stuhmer was there. Last year I coordinated the sixth edition of From Neuron to Brain, in which Walter reviewed some of the chapters. Sincerely, Francisco F.

Review synthesized by Bianca Melo Trovò. Genetic transcription happens through individual Transcription Factors (TFs) whose binding events can, in some systems, temporally correlate with the stochastic firing of transcriptional bursts. The determinant of bursting is however unclear, specially whether the DNA binding kinetics solely contributes to that. The study develops an imaging-based synthetic recruitment assay called CRISPRburst in order to measure the TFs impact on bursting kinetics. The authors find that the association of TFs with specific protein partners determines their bursting output, and train a model to predict the kinetic signatures of all human TFs. Major comments The manuscript reports that “the maximal intensity per transcription site (TS) is likely limited by physical constraints of the transcription machinery as a limited number of RNA polymerase molecules can be loaded per gene due to polymerase velocity and spacing”. It is recommended to describe how this limitation correlates with the value of active fraction, or could be part of further analysis of this functional data. ‘Functional characterization of TFs using an imaging-based synthetic recruitment assay’ section: “If the frequency and duration of active periods were solely defined by TF binding” [...] “TFs recruited via dCas9 would all exhibit similar active fractions”. This prediction appears to rely on the assumption that the binding rate is the same for all TFs, which is usually not the case. ‘Functional characterization of TFs using an imaging-based synthetic recruitment assay’ section: Given that the TFs that do not bind to the LTR also show high correlation, it is unclear how the correlation for the 6 factors that directly bind LTR justifies that dCas9 recruits TFs in a similar way to the physiological conditions. What is the explanation for the high correlation coefficient for the TFs that do not bind LTR? There is a question as to whether the dCas9 system represents the physiological conditions because the DNA binding kinetics for each TFs are distinct, and different from that for PYL1 binding to ABI1. It would be expected that those different DNA-binding kinetics also contribute to the frequency, duration, or intensity of bursting. Some clarification could be provided around this point. ‘Interactions with co-activators are more predictive of TF kinetic specificity than IDR features’ section “This model was unable to classify TFs into kinetic classes (Figure 3B, right), demonstrating that TF-cofactor interactions play a greater role in specifying kinetic function than IDR sequence content”: Given that TFs interact with cofactors through their transactivation domains, which are intrinsically disordered, why do the TF-cofactor interactions not lead to correlation between IDRs and the kinetic function? Could the protein-protein interactions besides IDR-cofactor (e.g. cofactor-cofactor interactions) play a role in the kinetic function? Do the cofactors cluster into the different kinetic function groups? Minor comments Introduction ‘differ in features typically used to classify TFs, such as DNA binding domain homology’: it may be worth making a mention in the introduction to what other binding partners TFs interact with. First paragraph of results ‘CRISPRburst, an inducible dCas9-mediated recruitment platform to study transcription kinetics’: What is the binding strength of PYL1 to ABI1? How does that compare to the typical TF-DNA binding strength? Figure 1C: “3) Live cells are imaged 16 h post-recruitment.” This is the end time point. Are there time-dependent data available? Figure 1 F,  G: The error bars are high. Can further information be provided in the legend on how these error bars were calculated (biological vs technical replicates)? Figure 1, ‘An average of 220 cells were analyzed per TF’ Does this imply that 220 transcription sites were scored? Considering each imaged cell has single integration of the reporter gene? ‘In total, the LTR-MS2 cell line stably expresses 1) the LTR-MBS reporter gene’: Is there information on where in the genome the reporter gene is integrated? And does it impact the transcription bursts? (considering the role of (epi)genetics in the transcriptional outcome as rightly reinforced by the data related to Fig.4). Functional characterization of TFs using an imaging-based synthetic recruitment assay: Please provide a description for the Krüppel associated box. “Upon recruitment, 28 TFs generate an increase in reporter active fraction”. It would be helpful to provide further clarification on how the reporter active fraction is defined and how the criteria ""ratio > 1.30"" was determined. A mathematical equation may also aid the description. ‘0.64 to 3.04 for active fraction and 0.68 to 1.64 for intensity (Figure 1F-G, S1E) ‘: It may be helpful to divide the active fraction (0.64 to 3.04) into different categories, for example, 3.04 - 2.5, 2.5-2.0 etc. to check whether these categories are correlated to function. Regarding intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in the Results section ‘Bursting kinetics define distinct TF classes’: Can further clarification be provided in the main text for the meaning of cumulatively longer IDRs. “these findings suggest that while the biophysical properties of IDRs may tune the amplitude of TFs’ effects, they likely do not solely encode TF kinetic specialization”: does this include post-translational modifications? If so, are there any relevant examples or illustrations? In the section ‘TF families exhibit broad kinetic diversity’ section, “the family-defining KRAB domain does not bind DNA but recruits cofactors, consistent with the idea that DNA binding domains provide little information on kinetic specialization (Figure S6B)”. It may be relevant to discuss potential solutions to these issues in the Discussion section. Discussion section “Our study centered on the simple HIV promoter thus provides a robust conceptual framework to investigate more complex systems, e.g. how TFs synergize with one another, interact with core promoter motifs, or communicate to promoters from distal enhancers”: all the future directions mentioned here are very relevant and exciting. Could the discussion of these items be expanded e.g., how do developmental cues drive TF kinetics or bursts? Methods section: Are there any anomalies observed in the subcellular localization of the TFs when tagged with PYL1 or under the ABA treatment? Comments on reporting The manuscript reports a partial least-squares multivariate regression model in which a predictive weight to each possible interactor was assigned. Can further description and a related equation be provided for this model? Fig. 3: Can further context be provided for the choice of SEM instead of SD which may provide a better representation of data variability?",2022-07-06T17:55:48,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2022.06.01.494187,The kinetic landscape of human transcription factors,"Nicholas E Mamrak, Nader Alerasool, Daniel Griffith, Alex S Holehouse, Mikko Taipale, Timothée Lionnet",2022-06-03

The paper say that Late Armenia cluster do have a partial continuity with Early Armenia cluster. The estimated proportion is 50%. That's looks good. But the other 50% can't be from Steppe as You state. Because Late Armenia cluster is shifted to Near East. So it's more likely that the extra 50% is from South not from Steppe 2.

Review synthesized by Michael Robicheaux. The preprint manuscript by Trendel et al., “Translational Activity Controls Ribophagic Flux and Turnover of Distinct Ribosome Pools”, presents a dataset that examines the lifecycle of human ribosomes, and their constituent subunit proteins, in response to translational inhibition using proteomics and cryo-EM approaches. The study focuses on the fate of 80S monosomes, which are shown to be inactive and to form a dynamic pool separate from active polysomes and nascent ribosomal subunits. General comments - The manuscript is well-written and organized, and the methodology is thorough and detailed. - The effort to validate mass spectrometry quantitative measurements, particularly the peptide sum normalization (PSN), is commendable. The description of total sum normalization and its weaknesses in this methodology is well articulated. This work will be useful for others working on similar problems in quantitative mass spectrometry. - The described pulse-SILAC methods are quite successful at monitoring protein stability in response to different perturbations; however, the statements in favor of ribosome subunit decay through ribophagy/selective autophagy require further support. Since ribosome component decay can be due to a variety of additional pathways (see cited reference #17, An et al., 2020), it may be necessary to soften the conclusions regarding ribophagy. Additional pulse-SILAC experiments in cell lines that lack key autophagy components (e.g., ATG12/FIP200 KO cells) could be considered to directly test the ribophagy model. - There are questions as to whether the cryo-EM processing supports the conclusions stated in the manuscript. Specific comments regarding this are provided below. In addition, additional processing detail in the flowcharts presented within the supplemental data would be helpful to better understand processing choices (e.g., D classes that move forward for additional analysis/classification/refinement). - It would be relevant to discuss how the proteomic half-life measurements compare to those published by Li et al. 2021 (Mol Cell), which use a different method (cyclohexamide chase). - The manuscript reports significant differences in the half-lives of the 40S/60S ribosomal subunits vs 80S/polysome fractions (Fig 1E), and states that these make up separate ribosomal pools without free exchange. However, it should be considered as an alternative that the decay rate of assembled ribosomes could be much less than the unassembled group so that the pool of free components becomes gradually depleted. In this case, exchange could still occur with a decreasing rate as the pool of free ribosome proteins are degraded faster than assembled ones. It would also be relevant to discuss the possibility that nascent 40S and 60S subunits form 80S monosomes in an alternative “life cycle” pathway. Specific comments and suggestions - In paragraph 1 of the Introduction, please specify the context of “serum withdrawal” as the stimulus for idle 80S ribosome accumulation. Is this from cell culture or some other system? - In paragraph 1 of the Introduction, the sentence, “ Degradation of ribosomal complexes, especially under nutrient-poor conditions, is mediated by ribophagy, a selective form of autophagy [14–17] ” could be more nuanced as it does not describe other non-autophagic ribosomal degradation pathways, such as those described in cited reference #17 (An et al., 2020). - In the “ A Highly Robust Normalization Procedure... ” Results section, the manuscript states that the intensive ribosomal purification methods lead to high variability in the mass spectrometry measurements. Based on this, have alternative methodologies been considered for ribosome purification? - In panel E of Figure 1, the color scheme makes the data difficult to differentiate, could also consider separate figures for the large and small subunit datasets. - In the “Protein Half-Lives in Polysome Profiling Fractions...'' Results section, “ On average ribosomal proteins of the small subunit had 3-fold longer half-lives within the 80S fraction compared to the 40S fraction (p=5.2E-8, Wilcoxon ranksum test), whereas large subunit proteins had 4.6-fold longer half-lives within the 60S fraction compared to the 80S fraction (p=1.0E-10). ” Are the “60S” and “80S” fractions mixed up at the end of the sentence? -In the “ The Monosome Fraction Predominantly Contains Inactive 80S Ribosomes... ” Results section, the manuscript reports, based on their cryo-EM data (Fig. 2), that 80S monosomal complexes are idle and distinct from polysomal 80S complexes. This conclusion of a single ribosome state would need supportive evidence. From the initial particle stack (>1 million) that yielded <60k high-resolution particles after classification: were there other low-resolution class averages or heterogeneous particles that may represent actively translating ribosomes? Conclusions about ribosome activity from less than 5% of the total pool of ribosomes could be due to the conformational plasticity of translating ribosomes. In a different paper (Brown et al., eLife. 2018), several structures/states of the ribosome come out of a smaller dataset. Furthermore, a structure of comparable resolution from the polysome fraction appears necessary to support the conclusion that the 80s monosome complex is functionally distinct. The same comparative data is recommended for conclusions drawn from the cryo-EM structural analysis of arsenite treated 80S particles (Fig .S6). - In the “ The Monosome Fraction Predominantly Contains Inactive 80S Ribosomes.. ” Results section, this section introduces ribosomal P-stalk proteins, their plasticity and role in active ribosomes, which are concepts that could be included in the Introduction section of the manuscript. - In Figure 2, it is unclear from the figure legend if the 80s monosome density in panel B is from the low-salt treated preparation in panel A or from a different prep. - In the “ Inhibition of Translation Produces Inactive 80S Ribosomes... ” Results section, recommend revising the text to reframe the conclusion as ""supports our model"". In the “An Increased Pool of Inactive 80S Ribosomes..” Results section, recommend toning down the claims about decay rates which may require control experiments in cells lacking key autophagy proteins, such as ATG12. - In the “ An Increased Pool of Inactive 80S Ribosomes... ” Results section, consider reframing the conclusions from the previous study (Trendel et al. 2019) to indicate that ribophagy is the predominant mechanism of ribosomal protein turnover in response to arsenite treatment. The prior study did not examine ribosomes treated with arsenite when autophagy was blocked. Additional quantitative tests for flux into lysosomes (Lyso-IP, Ribo-Keima shift assay) should be considered to support that ribophagic flux, specifically, eliminates proteins from ribosomal pools. Based on this comment, the inclusion of ribophagy in Fig. 5 and the statements in the final paragraph of the Discussion may require revision. - In the “ An Increased Pool of Inactive 80S Ribosomes...” Results section, the manuscript describes proteomic data in response to increasing concentrations of arsenite. The effects of these treatments on polysome profiles could be useful future experiments. - In the “ Constrained Conformational Plasticity... ” Results section, there are questions about this analysis due to the small size of the final particle stack for both proteins. An alternative analysis pipeline is to mix the particles from both datasets for the simultaneous analysis of all pooled particles, from which the number of particles in a given state can be quantified. - In the “ Distinct Pools of Ribosomal Subunits... ” Discussion section, the discussion of inactive 80S complexes potentially re-entering the polysome “assembly line” is quite interesting to consider in terms of its dynamics and follow-up experiments that would test this theory (including subcellular localization). In the “ Distinct Pools of Ribosomal Subunits... ” Discussion section, the manuscript posits that the degradation of newly synthesized ribosomal subunits is not energetically favorable; however, it should be considered that intrinsically disordered proteins, such as transcription factors, can be produced and quickly degraded in oscillatory patterns (e.g.  see https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.... A quality control pathway that would eliminate immature or nascent ribosomal subunits is conceivable. - Consider depositing all EM data in EMPIAR and relevant structures in EMDB/PDB, and depositing the mass spectrometry raw data in ProteomeXchange or similar database. A data availability statement could be added with relevant accession links and IDs. - It would be helpful to build a tool to browse protein-level half lives and re-analyze raw data (e.g., tidy script depositing in Github or similar).",2022-07-01T10:23:35,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2022.05.13.491786,Translational Activity Controls Ribophagic Flux and Turnover of Distinct Ribosome Pools,"Jakob Trendel, Milan Aleksić, Matilde Bertolini, Marco Jochem, Günter Kramer, Stefan Pfeffer, Bernd Bukau, Jeroen Krijgsveld",2022-05-13

At the moment, I have one question: Is there a reason why there is not a plot for Asian ancestry in Figure 3? I see mention of ""East Asian"" populations in the ADMIXTURE analysis section of the methods, and I also see a plot similar to what I might expect in Supplementary Figure 11.  It looks like the East Asian contribution is usually small, but the African contribution in Figure 3 is also often small. I mention this because there was a paper reporting mixed Native American ancestry for the MDA-MB-468 cell line (from Hooker et al. 2019), but this was not reproduced in the Cellosaurus ancestry estimates (from Dutil et al. 2019).  It was prepared for a slightly different reason, but I have some additional notes here.  Basically, I think difference may be due to Hooker et al. 2019 using 2 Chinese populations (CHB and CDX) as a proxy for Native American ancestry. So, if others might make a similar assumption, then I thought being able to visualize separate East Asian and Native American estimations might be helpful.  I don't know how common that might happen, but I was aware of at least one example. Thank you very much!

Review synthesized by Richa Arya. General comments It may be helpful to elaborate on how it is established that CHIP mobility is dependent on activity. The conclusion in the paper has been primarily drawn from the catalytically inactive H260Q mutant which is less mobile. However the fact that the puncta of the mutant are brighter and larger than the wild type and that it recovers slowly also indicates the protein might be inherently more prone to aggregation upon heat shock. Related to the above point, under conditions such as VER treatment and Act-D treatment, the nucleolar recruitment is unaltered but recovery is affected (which implies mobility may be affected). This leads to the accumulation of CHIP in the nucleus. In these scenarios, it may be relevant to report on the status of wild type CHIP activity? Conducting the ubiquitination assay as in Figure 5A with Act-D and Ver treatment would be informative. If no difference in ubiquitination is observed, it can be concluded that it is not the change in CHIP mobility that affects its activity, but rather it's activity that promotes CHIP mobility/dynamics (the conclusion from Figure 5). o Figure 1 : The question arises as to why the control and recovery show puncta in panel C, but not the HS condition. Also, to make it easier to appreciate the nucleolar localization of CHIP in the HS condition, zoomed in regions and overlay images would be useful. Figure 1b : To support interpretation of the results, it would be helpful to highlight some examples of the nucleolar localization of CHIP. Additionally, it looks like there are specific dots (that could be like condensates) in the Control and Recovered, but not during the Heat Shock cells, not in panel B. Maybe some quantification such as number of dots per cell/ intensity/size could accompany the images. Similar parameters of the condensate structures in the nuclei in the transiently transfected cells could be quantified. Figure 1 : Quantifications such as 2B and 2C could also be done for Figure 1, for both Hsp70 and CHIP. Figure 1E..’ K30A mutant exhibited impaired CHIP migration to nucleoli after heat shock (Fig. 1E)… ’ How strong is this impairment? Could it be quantified either by fluorescence intensity or via Western blot of the different cellular fractions. o Figure 2 : It would be helpful to have additional clarification on what the different parameters such as -""% of cells with EGFP-CHIP in the nucleolus' or 'CHIP intensity in the nucleolus' represent, as well as clarification on the transition from measuring CHIP nucleolar-to-nucleus intensity ratios for immunostaining (as in Fig S1E) to measuring just nucleolar CHIP intensities in the main Figure for the EGFP-CHIP overexpression experiments. Perhaps a western blot showing HSP70 expression with VER might be helpful in demonstrating that total protein expression is not affected and that it is only its activity being affected. ‘ a small molecule inhibitor of HSP70… ’ Some suggestions alongside the loss of function assays such as knockdown and inhibitor treatment: What happens to Hsp70 and thereby CHIP translocation to the nucleus in cells with high, medium versus low levels of HSP70 expression? Do the high-expressing cells show more enhanced CHIP recruitment to the nucleolus? Can it be quantified as to how correlated the efficiency of recruitment of CHIP is to the expression level of Hsp70? How does the nucleolar translocation of Hsp70 itself correlate with its expression level? Figure 2a : It is clear that the HSP70 co-localises with CHIP upon heat shock. Overlaid images might be better to highlight this but the use of green and red is not ideal for colour-blind readers. May be changed for bar graphs too (2d,e). Figure 2b,c : There is a question about the statement that mutant CHIP was unable to localise in the nucleoli due to lack of HSP70 binding in Fig 1E. In Fig 2B and 2C CHIP was able to migrate into the nucleoli (albeit at a lesser extent) with HSP70 knockdown? Maybe images corresponding to this experiment might help as well to allow the reader to see the difference in localisation? It is mentioned that CHIP auto-ubiquitination is important in its localisation in Fig 5 so does the CHIP K30A mutant necessarily verify that the lack of HSP70 binding is causing impaired migration to the nucleus in Fig 1E? Could K30A also affect its auto-ubiquitination? Suggest referencing supplementary figure 2 alongside Fig 2B and 2C, and changing the dots in this graph to red, to make it consistent with panel F. Figure 2d,e : Bar plots could be replaced with scatter plots showing individual data points as done in Supp. Fig 1E. Adding t1/2 values with FRAP traces would support the changes observed for recovery times across conditions. Calculating mobile fraction and reporting would also be helpful. Figure 2f,g : Suggest updating the figure legend to clearly distinguish both curves. Some additions may complement the FRAP analysis presented: - How does the FRAP mobility of CHIP compare between absence and presence of heat shock? - How does the FRAP mobility of CHIP compare in the recovery phase in presence and absence of heat Ver? - Is the CHIP mobility different in nucleolus versus nucleus? ‘and HSP70 inhibition did not si+gnificantly reduce its dynamics (Fig. 2F)… ’ Would there be any change in CHIP dynamics in siHSP70 cells? It would be helpful to mention this following Fig 2B/C. Maybe use 'mobility' instead of dynamics, to be more specific. o Figure3 : It will be helpful to include an overlay/merged image of the two channels, and to explain in the legend how the measured correlation coefficient is obtained. It would be nice to see what kind of sub-structures show the maximum colocalization. Fig 3c : HS+Rec condition should show a loss of correlation between CHIP and NPM1 and is an important control in this figure. Comparison with Fibrilarin is good, demonstrating a loss of correlation between the NPM1 and CHIP themselves under different conditions and data for Ctrl only conditions would also add value. o ‘it altered CHIP distribution, which more prominently overlapped with Act D-induced NPM1 ring formations (Fig. 4D)… ’ Can this be quantified? Maybe it will show more pronounced colocalization compared to heatshock alone. o  ' this observation suggests that proper nucleolar assembly may be necessary for CHIP dynamics'. It may be worth specifying the reference to Dynamics here: 1. Mobility measured via FRAP 2. Translocation efficiency done via intensity measurement or ration of nucleolus/nucleus intensity. FRAP measurement of CHIP may be helpful to conclude about the mobility of CHIP in the nucleolus upon heat shock, in presence or absence of Act D pre-treatment. A change in mobility may support the lack of translocation during the recovery phase in presence of Act D. o Figure 4 : (a) It may be worth commenting on why the Hoechst staining looks different between the Control and the Act-D conditions. Fig4d: It could be helpful to add images of NPM1 localization in cells treated with Act D, but not under heat shock. In other words, are these NPM1 rings specific to the heat shock response? The size of the cells and the nucleus are different for HS versus Act-D+HS panels. If the scale bar is consistent and this is a normally observed morphological change upon Act-D treatment, it might be helpful to note this size difference in the legend. o   ‘ We found that the activity of CHIP is not indispensable for heat shock-induced migration to the nucleolus (Fig. 5B). However, FRAP analysis of the nucleolar CHIP H260Q mutant showed a decrease in its dynamics compared to CHIP WT… ’ Maybe the fragment could be rewritten for clarity (e.g. is dispensable). What happens to the mutant CHIPH260Q localization upon recovery? Is it slower than wt? Is more mutant CHIP retained in the nucleolus upon recovery? o Figure 5 : Suggest showing a wt image as comparison, in panel B. An alternate interpretation for the observations with H260Q mutant could be that the mutation leads to instability and misfolding of CHIP (as suggested in the paper) which leads to increased aggregation (larger and brighter droplets, low mobility) upon heat shock with itself and other interacting proteins. This interpretation does not need to invoke a loss of ubiquitination activity as a cause, it could be another consequence of misfolded CHIP. Figure 5c: How do the mobility of wild type CHIP compare with the H260Q mutant in the nucleus or in absence of heat shock? If the mobility is the same during pre-heat shock/pre-translocation to the nucleolus, the wild type and mutant protein have inherently similar dynamics. And if this gets altered only in the nucleolus of heat shocked cells, it would support the conclusion that it is the activity of CHIP that helps retain its mobility in the nucleolus and possibly prevent its aggregation in this compartment. Figure 5f : If there were two independent experiments, can both be represented? Or was the data pooled from the two experiments?? Suggest representing the data as two points for CHIP wild type and mutant each, from two independent experiments. Figure 5g,h,i : Dot plot overlay on the boxplot might be nice to see the spread of datapoints. o    	‘ Interestingly, sizeable intra-nucleolar CHIP droplet-like structures could be observed after overnight heat shock in cells expressing the CHIP H260Q mutant, outnumbering their WT protein counterparts (Fig. 5E-I)… ’ In Figure 1C some bright foci are also observed in control and recovered cells. Are these similar to the ""droplet-like structures"" described here? o    	‘ These differences between CHIP WT and mutant assemblies may stem from the alterations in CHIP H260Q dynamics within the nucleolus (Fig. 5C and D) ’. Similar measurement as in Fig 5C could be done upon overnight heatshock to support this statement. o    	‘ Surprisingly, we found comparable redistribution of all CHIP variants to nucleoli during heat shock, suggesting an… '. Is this a cell line-specific difference, or could it be due to differences in approach, i.e. stable cell line vs. transient overexpression? Similar transient expressions in HeLa may help clarify this. o   Based on Fig S1E, it appears there might be both an HSP70 activity-dependent (smaller) and HSP70 activity-independent (larger) contributions to CHIP localization. VER treatment reduces CHIP relocalization to the nucleus by a small but significant amount both in control and HS-treated cells. o  Cell transfection - Suggest reporting the confluency of the cells before transfection (or at which they were seeded). Methods - In Figs 3C and 5G-I, there is a concern about the statistical approach to calculate p-values based on multiple measurements (nuclei) within each sample. The t-test and ANOVA assume that each measurement is independent, and multiple nuclei within the same sample are not independent. Recommend to either not report p-values or to average together the values from each sample and calculate the p-value using those sample-level means.

http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/07/042598#comment-5899350504,biorxivstage,4,"POSSIBLE MACROEVOLUTIONARY EXPLANATION Graham Coop appears content with this bioRxiv preprint publication, which would seem to present a true “version of record” of his thinking in 2016. (He did not have his text modified in response to the whims of journal reviewers or need to suffer the stylistic corrections of journal copyeditors.) Among those who provided feedback on earlier drafts, Coop lists Vince Buffalo who later (2021), more formally addressed the same topic in consultation with Coop (1). However, rather than naming bioRxiv directly, Buffalo cited Coop (2016) as having published in “Cold Spring Harbor Labs Journals” (2). This would seem not to have been picked up by automatic search engines, so no link to Buffalo (2021) is so far evident at this site. This is regrettable since Buffalo goes beyond Coop (and other commentators; 3) in suggesting that we should be considering macroevolutionary explanations for the failure of consensus population size ( Nc) to relate to population diversity (“Lewontin’s paradox”): Finally, beyond just accounting for phylogenetic non-independence, macroevolution and phylogenetic comparative methods are a promising way to approach across-species population genomic questions. For example, one could imagine that diversication processes could contribute to Lewontin’s Paradox. If large-Nc species were to have a rate of speciation that is greater than the rate at which mutation and drift reach equilibrium (which is indeed slower for large Nc  species), this could act to decouple diversity from census population size. That is to say, even if the rate of random demographic bottlenecks were constant across taxa, lineage-specic diversication processes could lead certain clades to be systematically further from demographic equilibrium, and thus have lower diversity than expected for their census population size.

Review synthesized by Ruchika Bajaj. The paper reports the use of an optimized computational model, GMMA, by preparing a randomly mutated protein library and screening the mutant library using an in-vivo genetic sensor for folding for successful protein engineering efforts. Here are a few points of feedback on the paper. 1. In the second paragraph of section, “Resilience towards mutations reflects thermodynamic stability”, the manuscript refers to the design of degenerate primers, “These were designed to cover the C-terminal half of edF106, amino acid residues 48-97”. Further explanation for designing degenerate primers for these specific positions would be helpful to the reader, for example by adding references from the literature. In the same paragraph, when mentioning the size of the library (10,000 - 20,000), it would be good to explain the reason for the specified size of this library. 2. The section, “GMMA analysis discovers stability effects”, mentions that, “Reliable stability effects could be assigned to 374 out of the 838 unique substitutions in the library”. Further explanation may be provided in this regard, for example to describe why/what variables could lead to unreliable stability scores for tested substitutions. 3. The study evaluated MM3 and MM6 combinations for the additivity of stability. It would be relevant to mention if other combinations like MM4 and MM5 were evaluated. 4. Fig 2b: more points could be taken on the steep regions. 5. For Supplementary Figures 4 and 5, please provide an explanation of curves or straight lines and explain the angle of fitted lines. 6. In the section “stability measurements validate GMMA”, in the sentence, “Thus, mutations which could be stabilizing in the fusion might behave differently outside of the CPOP context.”, would it be possible to elaborate more on this statement to clarify how the behavior may differ?. 7. Please indicate specific mutated amino acids in multiple mutants: MM3, MM6 and MM9, for comparison. 8. Please label residues in Figure 6b. 9. In the section, “Crystal structures show increased similarity to the 1FB0 design template”, the statement, “Only one or two would yield crystals indicative of a conformational change taking place in order to stabilize the crystal lattice.” Conformational change is questionable here, especially with low RMSD values. Would it be possible to elaborate on the statement or reframe it. 10. “showed much better agreement with its original design template spinach thioredoxin (PDB: 1FB0).” It may be helpful to provide some further context about this in the Introduction and conclusions sections. 11. In the section, “structure and sequence-based methods do not predict most stabilizing variants”, the text mentions the discrepancies in rosetta and GMMM. It may be relevant to provide some further discussion on what may be behind those discrepancies. 12. Although the mutated protein has been crystallized, a discussion on protein expression or oligomerization after the mutation and its relation to thermal stability would be helpful for the study. 13. A major point which has not been mentioned in this study is scoring of these mutations according to their function, functional aspects are important for the purpose of protein engineering and thus this could be relevant. It will also be good to correlate the stability of these mutants with its function to comprehend the protein engineering effort. 14. Minor point: In the section, “Initial library transformation”, please change “scraped off” to picked off. 15, Supplementary Table 4: Wilson B factor value is missing for eMM9. A possible explanation for the difference in the number of macromolecules in MM9 and eMM9 variants would be helpful. Is there a possibility of change in crystallographic oligomerization ?

Review synthesized by Vasanthanarayan Murugesan. The reciprocal regulatory relationship between the cell cycle and ciliogenesis is poorly understood. This study by Dougherty et al. aims to better understand how MAPK signaling pathways control ciliary assembly in Chlamydomonas and RPE1 cells. ERK1/2 is a MAPK protein that is activated predominantly by MEK1/2 and deactivated by DUSP6. For this, the study activates ERK, a well-known MAPK pathway, by inhibiting its phosphatase DUSP6 through the compound BIC ((E)-2-benzylidine-3-(cyclohexylamino)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one). The study shows that BIC leads to impaired ciliary assembly and maintenance in Chlamydomonas and impaired ciliary growth in hTERT-RPE1 cells. It further shows, in Chlamydomonas, that BCI inhibits ciliogenesis by disrupting total protein synthesis, microtubule organization, membrane trafficking, and partial kinesin-2 motor dynamics. The use of superplots to distinguish between the biological and technical replicates was well received by the community. The discussion is well written and ties together the various experiments conducted in this study. Certain sections could be rephrased to provide more clarity for readers. The following items of feedback were raised, to help solidify the claim that BCI affects ciliary assembly only through MAPK signaling: The majority of the conclusions about MAP signaling are drawn based on the treatment with the BCI compound whose selectivity is unclear. It is possible that BCI could directly inhibit other phosphatases involved in ciliogenesis such as CDC14, PPP1R35. A reference pointing to the selectivity of BCI towards MKPs or alternatively rescue experiments with the inhibitor U0126 could address this issue. It is shown that BCI leads to transient activation of the ERK activity which peaks within 30 minutes and starts fading away after around 60 minutes. However, most of the effects are studied at 2 hours, when the changes in the cilia length are most apparent. But the ERK activity at this time point is unclear. Simultaneous measurements of ERK activity and cilia length would strengthen the correlation between the two processes. Specific comments Introduction: “The cell cycle and ciliogenesis utilize the same structures at different times” can be written as “The cell cycle and ciliogenesis utilize centrioles at different times” as centrioles is the only structure mentioned in the text. Small item - “Ciliogenesis occurs when cells the exit cell cycle” to “exit the cell cycle” Recommend revising the segment “The ERK pathway controls the cell cycle” as it mostly talks about ERK regulation rather than how the pathway regulates cell cycle. Small item – “In C. elegans, mutations to MAPK15 directly regulate...” can be rewritten as “In C. elegans, MAPK15 directly regulates…” Results: Recommend revising the section “BCI-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation disrupts ciliary maintenance and assembly in hTERT-RPE1 cells”. The timings of ciliary shortening and its relationship to ERK activation is unclear. In the concluding statement, ciliary assembly was used instead of ciliary shortening despite the data in Figure 1H showing that ciliary assembly is unaffected by BCI. “Decreased KAP-GFP at the basal bodies” – This appears to be in contradiction to Figure 2B. “These data suggest that BCI inhibits the mechanisms and proteins involved in cytoplasmic microtubule reorganization.” – Recommend adding further clarification about this sentence. Figure 1 Figure 1D – It is unclear in the figure whether the P-value is calculated between concentrations 0 µM and 45 µM, or between 0 and all three other concentrations. A similar comment applies to Figure 1H and Figure 1J. Figure 1F – Was any axonemal maker other than acetylated tubulin used to control for tubulin acetylation defects? Figure SF 1E – Though the MKP2 mutant does not regenerate to wild type length, it does return to its own original length, can the text be adjusted to reflect this? Figure 1G-J – The conclusion in the text that BCI prevents cilia assembly could be clarified, as the data shows growth inhibition rather than assembly inhibition. Figure 2 Figure 2C – The legend is slightly cut off from the image. Figure 2C – It is unclear if there is a difference in the fluorescence intensity distribution. A line profile along the cilia would indicate if there is any change in the spatial distribution of KAP. Figure SF 2C – Is it possible to elaborate more on what specific conclusion this data suggests. Figure 3 Figure 3B – Is there any reason why the BCI-induced regulation of MAPK signaling affects ciliary protein synthesis in particular? There seems to be no reduction in total protein synthesis. Figure 4 Figure 4A – A clearer description of how BCI “partially” disrupts the transition zone would be beneficial. Cross-sectional imaging of the transition zone with higher concentration of BCI might make changes in the structure more apparent. Figure 5 Figure 5A – 36 µM BFA affects cell morphology and may affect the viability of the cells, can some further clarification be added about this and the concentration used.

Namely, how neuroscientists should interpret functional MRI signals at very high spatial resolutions with respect to the underlying neuronal and vascular activation changes. This manuscript extends previously described models of the conventional BOLD fMRI contrast and augments it to incorporate the additional (partly orthogonal) information about blood volume changes. This advanced model makes it possible to provide a more comprehensive understanding of various compartments of the brain's vascular tree. The authors then uses a combination of self-acquired/self-analyzed cutting-edge layer-fMRI data, to investigate the model parameters and draw novel conclusions about both: (1) the plausible range of vascular features (e.g. CBVrest) and (2) the working principle and interpretability of common layer-fMRI acquisitions methods (GE-BOLD and VASO). Some of the most important take-home messages are: -> The modeling work confirms that GE-BOLD is contaminated by locally un-specific draining veins, while the VASO-method is mostly insensitive to those contaminations, as expected. -> Novel insights about the emerging VASO technique are: A) the VASO signal is partly coming from diving arterioles with reduced layer-specific localization specificity. B) the empirically measured CBV changes are somewhat plausible with a wide range of possible baseline CBV values. while preferring larger baseline values. Overall, I think it makes a lot of sense that the authors find the best correspondence of simulated and empirical data for larger baseline CBV values than previously assumed. These previously assumed values were based on ex-vivo data. And it is known that cadavers have less blood in the parenchyma (dead people are pale). -> This is the first comprehensive layer-fMRI VASO paper of the human primary visual system. While exploratory studies in previous publications have already implied the feasibility of layer-fMRI VASO in human V1 (Huber et al., 2021: Progress in Neurobiology), this manuscript is the first study to show its robust applicability across groups of participants. This has important implications for a large user base (readership of this journal). I am sure that many other layer-fMRI VASO users will soon jump on this brain too. I want to acknowledge that an earlier BioRxiv version of this manuscript was discussed in the Maastricht layer seminar. I want to acknowledge input of other seminar attendees for their insights in discussing this paper (particularly Faruk Gulban, Alessandra Pizzuti, and Sebastian Dresbach). I have reviewed as previous version of this manuscript as being part of a PhD Thesis containing a chapter (3) referring to this manuscript: https://espace.library.uq.e.... I want to thank my co-assessors for discussing this manuscript. My comments during the thesis viva are already included in this revised version of the manuskript (e.g. discussions about segmentation quality). Thus, I do not have any remaining major concerns about the manuscript. Though, I have two stylistic comments: -> In light of B1-inhomogeneities, potential inflow effects, BOLD contaminations and many other constraints, it is not trivial to set up a VASO sequence at 7T. Maybe it would be appropriate to cite the first VASO study at 7T (Hua et al. 2013, MRM, 10.1002/mrm.24334). -> When I had discussed figure 4 with my department head, he was suspicious whether or not a GM mask was applied to make the VASO results look like they are more specific to the GM. Maybe the authors can explicitly state in the figure caption if this was the case or not. I encourage the publication of the manuscript with great enthusiasm. Conflict of interest statement: I am in a loose collaboration with the second author Saskia Bollman: We share co-authorship as middle authors for the preprint by Faruk Gulban ( https://www.biorxiv.org/con....

A few points after running the data, copy pasting from my blog... - in terms of fine scale ancestry, the Erfurt Jews show enough variation to be divided into three or four clusters, as opposed to just two as per Waldman et al. - some of the Erfurt Jews show excess ""Mediterranean"" ancestry, while others excess ""North African"" ancestry, and this cannot be explained with ancestral populations similar to Lebanese and/or South Italians, but rather with significant gene flow from the western Mediterranean and possibly North Africa - several of the Erfurt Jews show relatively high levels of ""East Asian"" ancestry that cannot be explained with admixture from Russians, or even any Russian-like populations, because such populations almost lack this type of ancestry, and instead show significant ""Siberian"" admixture - as far as I can see, there are no correlations between any of the observations above and the quality of the samples. That is, low coverage doesn't appear to be causing the aforementioned excess ""Mediterranean"", ""North African"" and/or ""East Asian"" ancestry proportions.

Diet-Related Metabolic Perturbations of Gut Microbial Shikimate Pathway-Tryptamine-tRNA Aminoacylation-Protein Synthesis in Human Health and Disease Abstract Human gut bacterial Na(+)-transporting NADH:ubiquinone reductase (NQR) sequence is associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, Alzheimer disease-associated sequence (ADAS) is further characterized in cultured spore-forming Clostridium sp. Tryptophan and NQR substrate ubiquinone have common precursor chorismate in microbial shikimate pathway. Tryptophan-derived tryptamine presents in human diet and gut microbiome. Tryptamine inhibits tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) with consequent neurodegeneration in cell and animal models. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase inhibition causes protein biosynthesis impairment similar to that revealed in AD. Tryptamine-induced TrpRS gene-dose reduction is associated with TrpRS protein deficiency and cell death. In animals, tryptamine treatment results in toxicity, weight gain, and prediabetes-related hypoglycemia. Sequence analysis of gut microbiome database reveals 89% to 100% ADAS nucleotide identity in American Indian (Cheyenne and Arapaho [C&A]) Oklahomans, of which ~93% being overweight or obese and 50% self-reporting type 2 diabetes (T2D). Alzheimer disease-associated sequence occurs in 10.8% of C&A vs 1.3% of healthy American population. This observation is of considerable interest because T2D links to AD and obesity. Alzheimer disease-associated sequence prevails in gut microbiome of colorectal cancer, which linked to AD. Metabolomics revealed that tryptamine, chorismate precursor quinate, and chorismate product 4-hydroxybenzoate (ubiquinone precursor) are significantly higher, while tryptophan-containing dipeptides are lower due to tRNA aminoacylation deficiency in C&A compared with non-native Oklahoman who showed no ADAS. Thus, gut microbial tryptamine overproduction correlates with ADAS occurrence. Antibiotic and diet additives induce ADAS and tryptamine. Mitogenic/cytotoxic tryptamine cause microbial and human cell death, gut dysbiosis, and consequent disruption of host-microbe homeostasis. Present analysis of 1246 participants from 17 human gut metagenomics studies revealed ADAS in cell death diseases.

Our earlier studies demonstrated that tryptamine induces glucose metabolism alterations in blood and in brain.

I'm going to take it step by step, commenting on clarity as I read through the paper. - I stumbled a few times in the abstract.  "" A deeper sampling of individual ants from two colonies that included all available castes (pupae, larvae, workers, female and male alates), from both before and after adaptation to controlled laboratory conditions, revealed that ant microbiomes from each colony, caste, and rearing condition were typically conserved within but not between each sampling category."" What does ""deeper"" mean, is it that you sampled ants from each caste?  (the way it's phrased now, it sounds somewhat detached, like stating that the colony had castes without stating that you sampled them) So colony number, caste, and wild vs lab are sampling categories?  What would it mean ""within, but not between each sampling category""? - What kind of sequencing did you do?  I'd like to see at a glance which -omics you are doing, right at the start of the paper, because I sometimes look for papers that use a particular method. - You use ""Tenericute"" in the abstract, and ""Mollicute"" in the Importance section.  For the readers unfamiliar with the two, it might be good to disambiguate. - The Importance section is somewhat long and repeats a lot of the abstract.  What made you want to do this study?  That no one has studied this ant's microbiomes?  That the findings might extrapolate to other ants?  That you could say something about individuality and colonial organization or evolution from the members' microbiomes? - ""Honey bee queens, workers, and drones also each have unique gut microbiomes, where worker microbiomes are more diverse than those of queens and drones, possibly due to worker foraging (9).""  ""Unique"" has the connotation of being individual, rather than a group characteristic.  Would ""discrete"" be a better term?  And I'm a bit confused by ""more diverse"".  Diverse how?  Is the meaning that the range of species within the microbial community is somehow wider on the taxonomic tree?  Or something else? - But now reading that honey bees have a core microbiome that is found in all colonies and castes.  But were we not talking about ""more diverse""? - ""However, strains [...]""  just need to be a bit clearer on what are these strains of. - What makes these microbiomes ""low-diversity""? - "" the samples collected from each colony were not differentiated from each other"" is unclear.  Do you mean that the team collected ants of caste X from all 25 colonies into a single blended sample?  Try to rephrase "" Whether the 19 common bacteria found in Texas T. septentrionalis and form a conserved microbiome that is found in other geographic regions or castes is also unknown."" is unclear to me.  Maybe try to break it up into shorter sentences. - ""major driver"" might suggest causality.  I think you mean that the differences in the presence or absence of those symbionts are producing the statistical effect of seeing differences between microbiomes, is that correct? - ""Colony JKH000270 lab-maintained ants were sampled after a year and 4 months (some male alates were sampled earlier) and Colony JKH000307 lab-maintained ants were sampled after 4 months."" I'm wondering if the time factor would be important in microbiome adaptation.  If it is, can the two colonies really be compared to each other?  Would you mind adding a couple of sentences to explain the procedure? - I'm not sure I understand how pupae and ant guts and whole ants will act as confirmatory datasets.  Would you mind elaborating? - ""Reads that were not classified as belonging to the kingdom Bacteria (i.e., those identified as Archaea or Eukaryote) using the SILVA database v128 (43, 44) were removed.""  I understand that including viruses, other fungi, diatoms, etc. would change the scope of the project.

The language is clear and engaging.  I do have some questions and comments that I hope might be helpful. - ""integral parts of an imperialist enterprise [20]. Imperialism granted Western scientists unprecedented access to the world, which they translated into scientific authority, power, and wealth,""  When I first read that, I  thought you meant ""power and wealth"" as in technology that spurred the Industrial Revolution.  Later on in the paper, you elaborate that it is the power of Global North academics over academics in the Global South.  I'm also thinking that maybe applied science, such as concentration of Big Pharma exploration and production would generate power and wealth today?  Later on, you write "" Implicit in this perspective is that first authorship, and authorship of publications in general, are ways to establish authority and accumulate power in knowledge production, which in itself is worth questioning. For example, how do established authorship norms promote inequity and dominance in Western science (e.g. [74])?"" Pretty much the question I had.  So, would it be possible to phrase the statement that is at the start of the paper in some way that lets me know to wait for that discussion at the end of the paper? You go on to explain:  ""The imperialistic dynamics that created the current structures of access and power within Western science between the Global North and South have also enabled Western science to assert dominance in global knowledge production [76], while erasing, appropriating, and subjugating Indigenous knowledge and authority. "" Which leads me to believe that you only meant academia power.  So, basically, I'm a bit confused by the flow.  But the ideas themselves are powerful and I'm glad to read them. - ""through foundational practices""  I understand that you mean foundational to science, not the imperialism here? - ""as expertise about the natural world continues to be disproportionately claimed by the Global North through publication practices.  Our findings serve as a case study that reflects the inequitable structures at the core of Western biodiversity science and their resulting disparities, e.g. in access, labor, collaboration, power, and designations of expertise and authority."".  To me, this is the most important statement.  And yet it's pretty far down, at the very end of the Introduction section.  On the one hand, I understand that it is the last step in a logical chain.  On the other, I would still like it to be one of the first things I see, to let me know what I'm reading towards. - ""This study shows how historical inequity continues to shape present day research practices""  I'm not sure it does?  To me, it shows the historical inequity, and it shows that inequity is still here today.  But I don't know if the paper describes the mechanism by which one generates the other.  And don't think it needs to, what the paper focuses on is far more important.  So I'd just rephrase that a bit to remove the suggestion of causality.  ""Things are bad.  Things are still bad.  We should think about that and fix it."" - ""1960"".  I'm cool with missing the years between 1950 and 1960, I just want to see a phrase acknowledging that, and saying you accounted for it in the statistics. - ""we did not include descriptions in which the species was extinct at the time of description""  Could you add a quick phrase explaining why?  As a fresh reader, I thought ""I'd feel it an honor to have a dinosaur named after me"".  And I'm genuinely curious what is the quality of that honor that makes it different from having a current species. - ""The prevalence of first authors from the Global South increases significantly toward the present (R2 = 0.143, p = 0.014), but the prevalence of first authors from the Global North remains consistent (R2 = 6.749e-5, p = 0.947) "" Is it not a zero-sum calculation?  Earlier, you make a similar statement, but without the word ""first"", so I concluded that Global South authors were being included as author lists generally grew in length.  But there can be only one first author per paper, so I'm confused by the calculation here. - In this paper, you speak of inclusion of Global South stakeholders in Western science.  You also speak of inclusion of Indigenous knowledge and worldviews in science.  So the ""The patterns of authorship we observed show that researchers from the Global South have increasing opportunities to participate in Western science""  statement feels like it's missing a piece. - ""prioritizes the Global North’s power to theorize and conceptualize [...] frames the value of people and their perspectives in terms of how they can benefit those currently in power"" and""Paradoxically, as taxonomic work has been devalued, [...] the roles of different individuals, and how different roles are supported and valued (intellectually and materially)""  Loved reading this. - ""Adhering to the fallacy of neutrality (which is in fact a non-neutral stance and one embedded in white supremacy;""  I understand that thinking one is neutral is a fallacy.  But how is it a non-neutral stance embedded in white supremacy?  Is it because privileged people have the ability to not see problems and therefore think they're being neutral?  I would want to see a bit more clarity in this phrasing.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.02.494602v1#comment-5888374621,biorxivstage,4,"The manuscript entitled “Feasibility of 3T layer-dependent fMRI with GE-BOLD using NORDIC and phase regression” explores whether 3T sub-millimeter MRI with 3D-EPI readouts can be a reliable tool for human layer-fMRI. The results suggest that it is indeed feasible. I find this very exciting and an impactful message to the emerging field of mesoscopic (laminar) fMRI. While most layer-fMRI studies are being conducted at one of the ≈ 100 installed 7T, this study shows that layer-fMRI can be extended to a much larger user base of ≈ 10.000 3T scanners installed worldwide. There are about a dozen 3T layer-fMRI studies published already (most are referenced in the manuscript). The study here stands out in the way it aims to generate voxel-wise activation scores with efficient EPI readout and produces layer profiles from small ‘columnar’ patches of the cortex. Most other previous studies used FLASH-based readouts to investigate fMRI signal mechanisms at very long TRs and/or had to collapse fMRI data from large brain areas together to generate one layer-profile. The approach presented here makes layer-fMRI at 3T more feasibly applicable for conventional neuroscience studies. It becomes apparent that the authors paid a lot of attention to high-level fMRI processing strategies and the highest possible quality of applying those. For example, the authors developed and employed a layer-fMRI quality score of inter-trial beta consistency across depth. I really like this measure on multiple levels: A) it can account for potential statistical inflation in NORDIC, B) it can provide a measure of data quality in absence of a ground truth layer profile, C) it allows comparisons across different analysis pipelines with different voxel-wise noise levels. Overall, I find the layer-profiles of the raw data quite convincing already (right panel in Fig. 3a). They are also quite reproducible across trials. While I appreciate the application of phase regression and NORDIC, these processing steps come along with some level of uncertainty and additional dependencies of their precise application setup and inherent assumptions. Thus, I admired the author's approach to show raw and filtered data next to each other. Furthermore, I appreciated the studies focus on high-quality pre-processing and acquiring a structural VASO scan to guide the alignment between BOLD-EPI and MP2RAGE data. I also appreciated the author's decision to only use half of the trials for the main analysis, while performing the ROI selection on the other half of the trials. Sacrificing half of the data to minimize the risk of circularity is an admirably choice. Especially in the tSNR limited regime of layer-fMRI. I enthusiastically encourage the publication of this manuscript. If the authors agree, I think they could improve the clarity of the manuscript by adding a few further details of acquisition and analysis. And maybe, they can also add a few additional discussion points about the generalizability of their findings. Itemized below. 1.) I find that the manuscript has a bit of a disconcerting message too. Namely, the authors find that the quantitative (beta-score) layer-profiles are substantially altered when phase-regression is combined with or without NORDIC. This means that the layer-fMRI profiles after phase-regression and after NORDIC-denoising are not reproducible across noise levels of the MRI data. The authors describe this as CNR-dependency in lines 103, 317, 348, 452, 516. This limits the generalizability of the results. It means that the profiles will not be reproducible for slightly different experimental settings (different RF coil, different flip angle, different GRAPPA factor etc.). The authors apply the phase regression for exploratory purposes. And they also show the results without phase regression. Thus, I think they provide a comprehensive and balanced overview in the current manuscript already. If the authors agree, they could add a few sentences in the discussion section about the implications of the CNR dependence for the generalizability of the results. How valuable are de-veining methods if the resulting quantitative profiles are not reproducible across different scanning and noise levels. 2.) I was a bit surprised about the choice of the excitation flip angle of 45 deg. For a 3D-EPI with a (shot-to-shot) TR of 84 ms at 3T, I would have expected the Ernst angle to be less than half of this (approx. 20 deg). All the other parameters including the flip angle of 45 deg are a perfect match with the 3T layer-fMRI Protocol that I have developed in Feb 2020: ( https://github.com/layerfMR... second protocol in pdf). So I think the authors must have used this as a start and retrospectively removed the VASO inversion pulse from the protocol for the purpose of BOLD. Though, the excitation flip angle for a BOLD fMRI time series should be differently optimized than for a VASO inversion-recovery protocol. Thus, I am afraid that the authors did not use a protocol that would have provided the best tSNR for BOLD. I do not think that this disqualifies the conclusions of the paper. I just think that the impressive results could have even been more impressive with a more appropriate excitation flip angle. Maybe the authors want to include a brief discussion about the expected effect of overflipping? E.g. There might be an advantageous effect of suppressing physiological noise of CSF (as discussed here: https://index.mirasmart.com.... Or maybe it’s just a typo? 3.) I was surprised that the analysis pipeline uses a ROI selection criteria that is based on the layer-activation. Described on line 249: :4 the peak signal in depths 0.3-0.4 should not exceed that of depths 0.6-0.8 {...}"". This has the potential to affect the resulting layer-profiles. I appreciate that the authors investigate this potential circularity in supplementary figure S3. They find that this selection criterion is not responsible for the slope modulation with phase regression, by defining the slope solely on upper layers. This solves the issue for me. Though, I am still wondering why the selection criterion was used? Is the reason related to the difficulty to isolate the Brodman area 4a from Brodman area 4p (​​ https://layerfmri.com/findi... Showing the slopes of ROIs that were extracted without this criterion might have been even more convincing in proving that there are no circularity effects. 4.)

The advantage of the authors’ plasmid shuffle experiments is that it allows the study of many mutations and variations of Abf1. The authors reveal that Abf1 possesses an essential motif (EM) as well as several contextual residues that work together to mediate Abf1’s function. Upon further investigation of compositionally and functionally similar IDR’s, the authors hypothesize that sequence specificity and chemical context in IDRs functionally overlap with each other rather than act independently, and propose a 2D model to describe the contributions of each in IDRs. The major success of this paper is in developing a model that reconciles two contributors to IDR function: sequence specificity and chemical context. The major weakness of the paper is that the model is not comprehensively backed with control experiments. The 2D landscape model presented argues that modulation of essential motifs and contextual amino acids can produce several binding modes; however, no data is presented to show that these chimeras are viable because they interact with the same factors or function in the same way that IDR2 does. Therefore, we can’t be certain if these are off-target effects or the same interactions that occur with IDR2 as put forward in the model.  In addition, we found some aspects of the organization of the paper may require more clarity. Overall, the paper reveals some of the functional determinants for Abf1’s IDR and proposes an intriguing model for the functional determinants of other IDRs, but it could be difficult for these findings to be generalized. Major points p.4: It is unclear to us why the minimal viable construct IDR2 449-662 is the background reference construct. Is it possible that IDR1 (absent in this construct) could provide unknown benefits in particular situations? For example, given the unknowns of Abf1’s interactome, is it possible that IDR1 helps to activate transcription of other genes that could rescue IDR2 mutants? Perhaps the presence of IDR1 could confer viability for IDR2 mutants that were deemed not viable in later experiments. Plasmid shuffle assays with IDR2 mutants that also have IDR1 present could be control experiments that answer this question. p.4 The constructs generated in this paper are tested for viability via plasmid shuffle assay, but there is no control experiment to ensure that these constructs are still interacting with the same partners or functioning in the same way that wildtype IDR2 does. One possible control experiment to test this could be to choose an Abf1-interacting partner based on proteomic literature on Abf1, and perform a co-immunoprecipitation/Western blot to see if the partner is still present across different IDR2 mutants. This control experiment should be done with full length Abf1, the background reference construct (with no IDR1), as well as a construct without the EM and a shuffled construct to represent the two extremes of the 2D landscape. p.5: The decision to choose the G4 motif does not have a strong justification or explanation. In figure 3F it is shown from the alignment between Abf1 and Gal4 that the region considered to have sub-homology does not overlap with the essential motif of Abf1 nor does it show similarity in its sequence. Therefore, in our view, it does not appear that Gal4 has an EM that is homologous to the EM of Abf1. Figure S1 PDF: By eye, it appears that there is large variation between the strains considered inviable – for example, FUS_1_163_WT clone 3 on page 6 and Shuffle 3 clones 2 and 3 on page 3 are both marked as inviable yet differ in growth. It could be helpful to readers if an explanation about why a binary classification of viable vs inviable was used in this study, as opposed to a sliding scale quantification. Minor points For a future direction, after identifying the essential motif in IDR2 (EM), we think it would be compelling to go back to the orthologs initially tested to see how conserved the essential motif is evolutionarily and to see how divergent the orthologs that we’re inviable were. We also feel that this could be incorporated into the paper’s discussion. Figure 3: Panels G-K were difficult for us to understand due to the sheer number of constructs presented. To us, the contrast between sequence-specific motif and chemical context would be clearer if panels E and K were combined, perhaps with labels “sequence specificity” and “chemical context” below the respective constructs, to underscore the two ends of the spectrum that these panels represent and to emphasize the unexpected viability of the constructs in K. p.2-3: The hypothesis that poorly conserved IDRs may still retain functional conservation is compelling, but the proteome-wide analysis of disorder leading up to this hypothesis could be clarified in the methods section. In particular, it would be helpful to include an explanation of why and how disorder score from metapredict and predicted pLDDT were used in conjunction with each other, as opposed to using the predicted consensus disorder score from metapredict alone.

We also argue that no normalization should be performed on the semi-synthetic samples. Hence, for fairer method comparison and using the updated dearseq package by Hejblum et al., we re-run the six differential expression methods (DESeq2, edgeR, limma-voom, dearseq, NOISeq, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) without normalizing the semi-synthetic samples, i.e., under the ""No normalization"" scheme in [1]. Our updated results show that the Wilcoxon rank-sum test is still the best method in terms of false discovery rate (FDR) control and power performance under all settings investigated. References 1.

I have a question for the authors, though. It seems that the theoretical findings on section II of the manuscript might rely on the assumption that the phase relationship between the harmonics (the phi_n) can be considered as phi_n=0 (meaning that all initial phases have the same value). This assumption is implicitly made in the case N=3, and explicitly stated in the case N=infinity, but it seems that it is not clearly justified throughout the text. Thus, it could still be the case that some of the theoretical findings would only be applicable to signals with phi_n=0. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify this issue.

We only saw your message today, but happy to discuss right away! 1. You are right that we did not specify the cervical or thoracic level of the human spinal cord samples in Table S7. The information there is the information that we received from the Netherlands Brain Bank, but I agree that it will be important to include the cervical or thoracic level of each sample. We do have low magnification images that we could also include in the revised version of the paper. I can share them with you before that and it will be great to hear a second, expert option on what cervical or thoracic level they belong to. 2. Thanks for bringing up those intriguing Cnr1-expressing ependymal cells in the rat spinal cord. I had a look in our integrated dataset (10x and Smart-seq2 datasets from 3-month-old mice) and found 19 cells expressing Cnr1 (0.68% of the cells). Most of them localise to the immature lateral cell clusters (activated or not). This is strikingly similar to the numbers that you found in the rat by immunofluorescence. Also in line with your findings, the percentage of Cnr1-expressing cells does not seem to change much with age (0.63% of ependymal cells express Cnr1 in the 10x dataset from aged mice). It is difficult to tell you more about Cnr1-expressing cells because of how very rare they are. I am planning to integrate our dataset with other datasets including spinal cord ependymal cell transcriptomes as they become publicly available to increase cell numbers and get even further with the downstream analysis (e.g clustering, differential expression analysis). I will keep Cnr1-expressing cells in mind, and keep in touch! :) Thanks again for taking the time to comment on our preprint. I look forward to continuing the discussion!
