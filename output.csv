https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.14.544919v1#comment-6211730753,biorxivstage,1,"These views are my own only (I did not involve any of my past or present colleagues and collaborators) Thank you for this ambitious endeavour, I have some comments. Comment on the discussion: While I agree with your point on exponential distributions (we make exactly this point ref. 36), the claim that one generally cannot fine-tune the variability of the cycle phase length with ODEs (p 15-16) is misleading. we do exactly that with our sub-steps approach (that you mention) which in fact permits the modulation of the cycle phase length variability from quasi invariable to exponential. It has actually been shown that mammalian cycle phase durations follow Erlang distributions (as they arise from our sub-steps). In our work, we estimate the coefficients of variations of the cycle phase length when identifiable from the data and discuss the information generally contained in this regard in our thymidine analogue incorporation experiments. Comments on the agent-based model: Minor comment (1)  EdU/BrdU incorporation. In my hands EdU is not immediately detectable in the thymus following injection (as is often assumed) and it takes more than 30 minutes to label all the cells in S phase (admittedly it was IP injection, and as you perform intravenous injection, labeling should be significantly faster). Here, if I understand correctly, you assume 0.5% of DNA being labeled is sufficient for detection which would label most cells after a couple of minutes in S phase when the analogue is present. Did you check this was the case (thymus collection 10 min after injection for instance)? You further assume that labeling stops abruptly after 45 minutes. However it does not seem plausible for incorporation to cease suddenly and a gradual decay of the analogue availability seems more realistic. Since you have time course data which can reduce the dependence of the result to the initial labeling phase, the effect of these assumptions might be very limited but it would still be useful to check to what extent these assumptions affect your result. (2) I found difficult to identify exactly what data you use for fitting (which is of course essential to judge the results) and how the data is assigned to your model, I think some clarifications would really be beneficial to the readers. Do you use exclusively EdU/BrdU information or do you combine this information with total DNA content (distribution of cells across the cell cycle)? Here is a point of particular concern: (3) I understand that you do not allow transition from cycling to ""long G1""/”quiescent”, sometimes finding these “long G1” cells represent >90% of a given population. Given the duration of each stage of thymic development (60 h for total DP for instance according to your 2017 review) it seems very unlikely that labeled cells do not contribute significantly to the quiescent subpopulations within 20 hours and in any case, this should certainly not be assumed a priori. From my own experience ignoring the cells transiting to quiescence/long G1 after the initial label incorporation might greatly distort your result by affecting the rate of entry in S phase. I expect the introduction of transition rate should improve your fit when a quiescent population is present (for later time points in particular) although I cannot conclude based on the data you currently present. In general, I find the exclusion of cells from the dynamics (which sometimes turn out to represent the overwhelming majority of the population) to be an extreme decision and I don’t think this should be made without strong evidence (simulations?) that this does not invalidate your result. (4) Along the same line, differentiation and transmission of labeled or unlabeled cells between compartments should be considered carefully. Differentiation can certainly affect percentages of labeled cells in a downstream compartment over time. While in some cases, the influx compared to local proliferation can be negligible (given the difference in size between compartments and respective cycling properties), it is a point which should be addressed for each cell compartment. If I understand correctly, your model poses that cells leaving a compartment are replaced exclusively by non-labeled cells. This is not neutral and, in some cases, may cast significant doubts on your predictions. For instance DN4 are directly downstream of the highly proliferative DN3b, and DN4 cells will be progressively replaced mostly by labeled cells as time goes on. At the very least, it should be discussed compartment by compartment why you think the assumption of exclusive influx of non-labeled cells holds given what is known of T cell development dynamics. While you have certainly built an important dataset, the manuscript at its current stage gives the impression that some essential features of the EdU/BrdU dynamics have been overlooked in the agent-based model. hope my comments will prove helpful.",2023-06-19T11:25:43,disqus_v2CCcS4nrO,Adrien Jolly,10.1101/2023.06.14.544919,High-resolution mapping of cell-cycle dynamics during steady-state T-cell development and regeneration in vivo,"Heike Kunze-Schumacher, Nikita A.

The overall flow of the paper, namely the shift from theoretical predictions to experimentation was a good segway into your web application. However, I did have some critiques, mostly regarding the figures. One general comment is that all schematics with red and green should be recolored for colorblind readers. Fig. 2a) Perhaps an overlay or neighboring graph showing what the expected CD specter for G4A4 RNA would be helpful to readers that this does in fact resemble what is expected. Fig. 2b) Indication of significance needed. Fig. 2c) This hierarchical clustering schematic should be much larger, and possibly contain a legend for interpreting the opacity of the colors. Fig. 2d) The label at the top is unnecessary and slightly misleading, and the labels at each axis should be larger. Fig. 3b,c) Pie charts should include percentages/quantities for all portions. Fig. 4d) Placement of p-value is confusing, perhaps place it over the area where the differences become significant. Fig. 5a) The x-axis labeling here is confusing. One solution could be to just put “neutral” and “very high,” or assign values to them, like “neutral” as 0 and “very high” as 1. I also noticed that your graph lines are closer towards the middle, however this could have been missed and should be made to appear more obvious to the reader. Fig. 5b, 6c) Color-coordinating the proteins listed in these figures based on classification/function would provide a richer understanding of the trends observed in G4 binding propensities. While this would interrupt the current color scheme in 5b, perhaps bold font would be sufficient to indicate controls. Fig. 6a,b) Data points are too clustered in these graphs; differently colored dots would probably work better. Fig 6c) This graph has some distortion (vertical stretching).",2023-06-15T17:28:22,disqus_JD9qKFH7OS,Grace Donnelly,10.1101/2023.04.01.535204,Identification and prediction of G-quadruplex RNA-binding proteins with roles in transcription and phase separation,"Johanna Luige, Alexandros Armaos, Gian Gaetano Tartaglia, Ulf Andersson Vang Ørom",2023-04-01

First off, really great work! The paper reads very well (especially the GLM section in the methods) and the findings are very interesting. I had a few questions that I hope you feel comfortable responding to. 1) Figure 1E During periods of lower correlation between global and local NE, is the mouse doing anything in particular? For instance, do these lower correlation periods correspond to bouts of either high or low movement? 2) Figure 2 Could you speculate on the mechanism for the coupling between local Ca2+ and local NE? In my mind it is hard to picture how a single small region of an LC axon would end up becoming really specifically active for seconds at a time. Do you think it is driven by maybe strong glutamatergic synaptic activity onto specific neurons? Maybe this could cause glutamate spillover onto the LC axon which could activate presynaptic LC glutamate receptors? 3) Figure 2 Have you noticed in your local interactions if the cells start firing before the rise in NE or if the NE rise precedes the cells firing? 4) Figure 5 The uptake and release mechanisms look to be on the same spatial and temporal scale. I would have predicted that the release timescale would have much more rapid fluctuations with higher variability than the uptake timescale. Does this mean that the release has a mechanism that overlaps with uptake? For example, maybe reverse transport out of the NET?",2023-06-13T21:33:49,alexsonneborn,Alex Sonneborn,10.1101/2023.06.09.544191,Spatiotemporal organization of prefrontal norepinephrine influences neuronal activity,"Samira Glaeser-Khan, Neil K.

Aside from the few grammatical errors and occasionally awkward sentence structure, I think that the basis and purpose of this paper was very well-explained. However, I do feel as though the usage of the term “interactome,” while certainly valid in the context of this paper, does occasionally leave much to be desired in terms of clarity. If possible, I think further elaborating on the specific implications this research has with regards to its significance towards the interactome would be helpful for the reader to better understand the importance of the paper. In other words, further fleshing out which particular interactions are implicated in or significant with respect to your research would, in my opinion, help give the reader more clarity in appreciating the importance of your work. 2. It appears as though the paper as a whole lacks much in the way of hard statistics (F-tests, Z-tests, etc). Instead, much of the figures seem to rely more-so on summarizing apparent raw data with little context or clear explanation to accompany it. Figure 3 is a major example of this. While it does say that a two-way ANOVA was used in order to calculate statistical significance, the figures themselves don’t necessarily reflect that all too well. Also, figure 3b won’t be visible to those who are red-green colorblind, so I’d advise changing the colors on that! 3. The web application you have provided is quite impressive! I applaud your work in that regard immensely. However, I think a more in-depth explanation of its mechanics within the paper would help a lot with regards to reader clarity. For example, providing a more clear definition of “propensity” in the context of RNA-G4 binding would go a long way in making the potential applications of your web tool more apparent to the reader.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.04.535535v1#comment-6202295790,biorxivstage,0,"Virtual screening (VS) has emerged as a powerful method for quickly screening vast libraries of compounds and reducing them down to a small pool of candidates that can be investigated in a time and cost efficient manner. While great improvements have been made in both reducing the computational time as well as the biophysical modeling of ligand binding, the success rate of VS can still vary between targets and limitations exist. Traditional virtual screening methods make simplifying assumptions about empirical parameters and consequently VS may not capture the intricacies of molecular recognition. These  scoring function simplifications lead to inaccuracies in predicting receptor-ligand poses and relative affinities. In this paper, the authors address whether incorporating experimental electron densities (ED) of ligand-bound structures can correct for these simplifications in the scoring function and therefore improve enrichment and diversity of compounds in VS. Based on a pre-existing crystal structure of a receptor, the authors calculate the intensity of ED at grid points and incorporate those values into a modified scoring scheme which they call ExptGMS. Incorporating ED of the binding site also introduces ED of solvent molecules and alternative side chain conformations which provides information about pocket dynamics and accessibility that can be relevant to ligand binding. Such information might implicitly encode the displacement of water molecules, rearrangement of side chains upon ligand binding or other features. These aspects may be simplified (rigid structures) or omitted (solvent) in other VS programs. To test the effectiveness of their approach, they benchmarked their method against existing ligand or receptor-based VS software showing a small improvement in balancing positive hit identification and hit diversity. The authors then optimized their algorithm by factoring in a low resolution cutoff to the ED. High resolution ED will result in high intensity grid points; because the authors scoring function favors ligands that occupy ED peaks this could lead to bias against compounds that miss the exact centers of those peaks. Therefore, the authors also included low pass filtered (maps calculated only using low resolution reflections) data which produces a more smoothed distribution of ED intensity which they argue accounts for more conformational variability, however, this must be balanced against using too low resolution data, which would result in information loss about ligand fitting to features in the density volume. They then tested it against the SARS CoV 2 protease 3CLpro which yielded several compounds that exhibited IC50’s in the low micromolar range. The major strength of this paper is a protocol for incorporating ED of bound ligands to alter the scoring function used in specific receptor binding sites in VS. Currently, this procedure produces comparable results to existing VS software such as GlideSP, which do not have any ED term. Many existing docking algorithms work iteratively by gradually introducing more complex terms; they are aided by scoring functions which assign greater weight to molecules that can form empirical interactions with the receptor. In some cases, a ligand is missed either because the correct binding pose can’t be found or because the scoring function penalizes a lack of strong interactions. In these cases, the ED based scoring function could be utilized to aid the scoring function. The inclusion of the solvent ED in mapping out the binding site and aiding in ligand placement to be particularly interesting from the perspective of developing VS docking tools that take advantage of apo-structures that don’t have ligands already bound to them, which could expand the use of this method.  The major weakness of this paper is, as mentioned by the authors, that this method is limited to proteins that have electron density with ligands bounds which limits its utility for receptors with no known ligand bound ED (although see point above for potential for expanding the domain of applicability). Given the current implementation of ExptGMS, we are curious to know if the authors tried generating electron density grids based on the solvent density in the binding site alone. Augmenting VS scoring functions by incorporating experimental ED may further improve docking scores by aiding the placement of molecules using existing binding data of ligands as well as solvent; however, currently the performance improvements offered by this method are modest. Major points: In figure 2, the authors compare how well ExptGMS performs relative to other virtual docking programs by examining the number of top 10, 50, and 100 compounds that are detected and the diversity of compounds. The 2D plot used does not sufficiently describe how differences between datasets used in the DUD-E database could affect these results. For example, did ExptGMS (and the other programs) do much better with some datasets than others? It would be helpful if the authors could show representative graphs from individual datasets to make the differences in performance more clear. In figure 2 the authors benchmark ExptGMS against several VS software programs that are either ligand or receptor based. They note in figure 3 that their method can improve false negative/positive hit detection. What was the overall false positive/negative rates between the methods used? Do the authors see a relationship between the number of top 10, 50, and 100 compounds and the false negative/positive rate? Does this depend on the choice of software (ex ligand vs receptor based VS)? It would be helpful if the authors could further elaborate on the false positive and negative hit detection rates between their method and the existing VS methods. We feel the 3CLpro in vitro assay description is unclear as it is written. Is this a peptide displacement assay? Further, what was the construct for the peptide/choices of fluorophores? Further explanation of how the in vitro assay was constructed and performed would be helpful. In Figure 5, the authors describe one possibility for why ExptGMS with different resolutions complemented each other by using solvent exposure in the pocket. How are t-test results in box plots ? We feel that it is difficult to judge whether the red and blue boxes in each resolution have statistically significant differences. In Table 1, the authors try to demonstrate the usefulness of multi-resolution analysis using a machine learning model. The table seems to show the advantage of the combination between GlideSP and multi-resolution ExptGSM. However, we are concerned about multiple hypothesis testing. This is also related to Figure 5. The authors tested more and more things about multi-resolution analysis but did not show a principled test. It would be helpful to get a deeper understanding about multi-resolution analysis if the authors could provide their thoughts and tests related to the principle.

Since the manuscript explaining the method of measuring DAAO activity from oxygen consumption rate is still in preparation, it becomes hard to verify your experimental results and possibly replicate the experiment. Releasing the manuscript as soon as possible and referencing it in this paper would be helpful. 2. The graphs in figure 4 seem to be made using a one-way ANOVA, but since the text compares between the two different cell populations of RPE1-hTert-DAAOH2B and RPE1-hTert-DAAOTOM20, it may be better to perform a two-way ANOVA. 3.

The authors establish an invertebrate model of gut colonization, which potentially has multiple benefits over current mouse models (e.g., lower cost, reduced ethical concern, simpler upkeep, less training needed); with further development, this model could be impactful for studies of infection by Enterobacteriaceae species. The presentation of the data throughout the paper is clear, and the data quality is good. The main conclusions of this paper are supported by the data. However, the choice of strains and antibiotics mean that there are a limited number of datapoints to address clearance of bacteria using antibiotic or bacteriophage treatment. Furthermore, more work is necessary to confirm the utility of this model system in recapitulating human infection and for determining the efficacy of potential treatments. Major Comment: In Figure 7, it would be helpful to include additional strain-antibiotic/phage combinations. The combinations already tested mostly involve strains that are inherently resistant to antibiotic or phage (e.g., Kp 419614 is resistant to both antibiotics, and Kp 14520 is resistant to both phages), limiting the information that can be gleaned from these experiments, including the relative efficacy of antibiotic and phage treatments. It would be informative to also test antibiotics that the strains are all susceptible to, and/or to include strains that are not resistant to the chosen antibiotics and bacteriophages. Minor Comments: 1. Table 1 does not have units for what we presume are MICs. 2. Can the authors comment more on the normal microbiome composition of G. melonella, and specifically whether there are any species that could potentially outcompete the K. pneumoniae or E. coli strains used in the study? Suggestions for Additional Experiments: 1. It would be informative to compare a range of bacteriophage and antibiotic concentrations in the experiment shown in Figure 7. 2. The authors use the same infectious doses (10^5 and 10^6) for the additional two Kp strains and three E. coli strains based on the determined effective dose for Kp14520. It would be worthwhile to determine the optimal infectious doses for each of the other strains. 3. It would be interesting to see the impact of bacteriophage treatment on colonization when the larvae are injected with the bacteria (rather than force-feeding). 4. It would be interesting to examine the microbiome composition of the larvae and the impact of bacteriophage treatment on microbiome composition.",2023-06-01T23:23:29,disqus_y9FR6hyg5J,Joseph Wade,10.1101/2023.03.27.534343,Bacteriophage-mediated decolonization of Enterobacteriaceae in a novel Galleria mellonella gut colonization model,"Kamran A.

I thought it was impressive to see both in vivo and in vitro approaches, as well as comparison between time periods and locations. I wanted to make the following comments and ask the following questions concerning the paper: In which lobe of the lung were samples extracted from? It may be beneficial to specify this. Why were only male hamsters used? It is somewhat concerning, considering the differences between males and females in ways such as weight, which was an important comparison point in your paper (Fig. 2H). Would it be possible to include the omitted trials somewhere in the figures, even in the supplemental figures? For example, I saw that samples from 7 dpi were taken. However, data from 7 dpi was not included in the relevant figures (Fig. 2I and Fig. 2J). I also noticed trials that were stated to have occurred elsewhere in the paper, but later omitted in the figures, in Fig. 1I, Fig. 3B, Fig. 3F and Fig. 3G. Have you considered any other tests for significance, aside from a student’s t-test? With repeated trials, tests such as a t-series may be a better fit. One example of this comment being potentially relevant is Fig. 2H.

Screening a relatively small number of variants becomes especially important when enzyme activity cannot be coupled to a high throughput sequencing readout. The major goal of the paper is to provide a proof of concept scoring and filtering system for selecting among proteins generated using computational methods to meet this challenge of efficient screening. They consider proteins generated using 2 machine learning methods and one phylogenetic method (ancestral reconstruction). The end result is a scoring filter combining the language model ESM-1v (which uses only sequence information) and the deep learning method ProteinMPNN (which is trained directly to find the most probable amino acid for a protein backbone predicted by AlphaFold2). After accounting for some simple idiosyncrasies of merging generative models with reality (ensuring starts with Met, removing repetitive sequences, accounting for localization signals) with heuristics, their filtering steps results in an enrichment of active sequences. The major success of the paper is a pipeline that actually works for selecting active sequences both in the experiments they conduct and (to some extent) literature examples. The table of potential protein failure modes is particularly useful as a baseline approach and reference for people designing sequences with computational methods. It is especially insightful to see how few deliberate filtering steps in the training process can have a big change in the outcome. We expect that a combination of sequence and structure-based filters will be used for prioritizing screening resources in the future. This paper lights the way of how to do that. The next steps will be to take into account structural features beyond stability (which is presumably covered by the AF2/ProteinMPNN), such as catalytic residue positioning, pocket size complementarity to substrate, etc. These are presumably implicitly captured by ESM-1. The next logical step (beyond this paper) is to go beyond statistical combination of these two scoring features to account for such features explicitly or with a new integrated deep learning approach. Major points: We are a bit confused about the exact value and sequencing of each part of the selection/filtering pipeline. We interpret experiment 3 as: Apply ESM-1v and Quality Filters and then apply a ProteinMPNN filter on top of that. Select Negative Controls by selecting sequences that fail the first filter (ESM-1v and Quality Filters) but are within 1% sequence identity to the closest natural sequence for some positive. The quality checks discussed in the supplementary information seem to have substantial impact. If the selected control sequences failed this quality check, it’s not clear whether the success of the pipeline is due to these heuristic quality checks or due to the computational filtering. These filters are biologically simple such as starting with a methionine, removing long repeats and not having a transmembrane domain - and it is kind of amusing to one of us (JF) that generative models have these pathologies so commonly. More discussion on why these filters were applied and what the distribution of effects were for the quality filters vs the insilico filters would help clarify the impact of each stage. This confusion then extends to determining how each of the two computational methods affect the selection. The authors contend that “no single metric would be sufficiently generalizable to screen against multiple sequence failure modes” and hypothesize that ProteinMPNN and ESM-1v “may capture distinct features.” However, because negative controls were selected only after failing the initial ESM + Quality Filters, its impossible to know what effect adding ProteinMPNN on top of ESM had. This is even more relevant given that the structures used to obtain proteinMPNN scores are first generated with Alphafold.  Alphafold can be computationally intensive (expensive to run) and therefore it is imperative that we understand how much this part of the pipeline contributes to the overall success of the selection process. The authors themselves contend that “Structure-supported metrics, including Rosetta-based scores, AlphaFold residue-confidence scores, and likelihoods computed by neural network inverse folding models, take into account protein atom coordinates potentially directly capturing protein functionality, however, they can be impractical to compute, especially when evaluating thousands of novel sequences.” This is something that can potentially be teased out. In the case of the paper only 200 proteins were selected using ProteinMPNN, however, if many sequences end up passing the ESM filter and budget allows it would be within reason to expand this random ESM selection. In summary, it is a bit hard to tell (without some ablation studies) which different pipeline components and filters drive the results. Additionally, it would have helped if these same quality filters were applied in Round 2 but that doesn’t seem to be the case? A deeper discussion on the selection of quality filters would also point the way forward with combining more “functional” structural features as outlined above. Minor points: 1) The author’s generalize the results with a few literature examples:  “similar results were obtained by independently validating COMPSS on previously published datasets of six enzyme families generated by models not considered in the present study.” Looking at the results in more detail reveals that some of these (including one that we generated!) are very small samples and this caveat should be discussed. In 3 out of the 6 studies, only 1 sequence was selected by their pipeline. In another of the 6, 2 were selected. In all 4 of these studies, a number of actives were missed. The limited number of selected sequences makes it hard to know how effective the pipeline really is in these 4 studies. Further, with such a stringent filter is not practical especially when we consider the fact that the authors don’t discuss the level of activity across positive and negative active compounds. It’s entirely possible that you could miss very active sequences and select only moderately active sequences. In one retrospective, the results were truly similar, however in the last other study, the filters worked far from intended. Even more, my team has observed in its own work that the sensitivity of machine learning models for scoring can be heavily dependent on the sequences the models have seen before. It would have been useful for the authors to consider how the tested enzymes overlap with the model training data to understand whether these scorers generalize outside the models training distribution. 2) The authors largely discount natural sequence identity as a metric: “Surprisingly, neither sequence identity to natural sequences nor AlphaFold2 residue-confidence scores were predictive of enzyme activity.” I think it’s important to qualify this with the fact that we are looking at sequences in the 70 to 90% range with very little dynamic range here. In their first experiment they looked at sequences in the 70 to 80 range. in their second they look at sequences in the 80 to 90 range. In their third experiment they looked at sequences in the 50 to 80 range but their filters end up selecting for sequences in the 70-80 range anyways. So it’s possible that locally, identity might not select for select for activity but globally, it could be a first filtering step on its own (which maybe is obvious and hence why it’s not more qualified?). Also to note is that sequence identity seemed to fare as well as or better than other metrics in identifying functional GAN-generated sequences and could be its own generative method: More problematic I think is figure 3f and figure 3g: It seems like the inactive controls are largely in a separate part of the tree compared to the active sequences passing and control. Does this have anything to do with the fact that these features failed the sequence based quality filters. Second,it suggests an approach where if you have some idea of where to focus on in the tree you could use sequence identity to those natural sequences as a metric for selection . Of course this information may not be readily available but the authors should discuss whether we could have hypothesized that the failing controls would have failed beforehand by considering their phylogenetic origins. Technical points: 1) There is some problem with this sentence: “CuSOD training sequences had only a single Sod_Cu domain, while MDH had an Ldh_1_N followed by an Ldh_1_C domain and no other Pfam domains that generally only rarely occur in 6.3% and 1.7% of sequences in both families, respectively.” It’s much better captured in the supplementary material: “For CuSOD, 1,632 out of 25,701 proteins (6.3%) had aberrant architectures. For MDH, 1,127 out of 65,639 (1.7%) had aberrant architectures.” 2) It’s not clear where/how they selected the natural test sequences for rounds 1 and 2. We assume it’s from the curated set of data but that’s not necessarily a given, further it seems that in round2, sequences were selected to span the range of esm scores. Was this done for the test natural sequences as well? “Only 13 test natural sequences were selected, as we had already screened five similar natural sequences in the remediation for Round 1.” “Besides the identity range, the experimentally tested sequences were selected to span the entire range of scores on each metric (Supplementary Table 4)” 3) The authors should be more explicit on the natural sequence identities in each round. If you check the supplement you can find this information if you pay attention to the figures or check the supplement but I think that it should be explicitly stated in the section “Round 2: Calibration data for COMPSS” that sequences are selected in the 80-90 range and in Round3 that the filters resulted in sequences with >69% identity. 4) The following section is confusing: “To further test the hypothesis that poor truncation selection was responsible for the lack of observed activity in the Round 1 CuSOD natural test sequences, we assayed an additional 16 natural SOD proteins (pre-test group)…” It should be stated at the beginning that 14 of the 16 test sequences are CuSOD sequences and 2 of the sequences are FeSOD sequences vs letting the reader figure that out later in the paragraph. Additionally, it would help the audience to say explicitly that 3/7 bacterial sequences with clipping also passed or include the table from the supplement up front. 3/7 doesn’t seem clearly distinct from 4/5. 5) What’s the reason for changing the esm-msa sampling method in round 2? Did they observe some benefit or was this purely a computational choice? 6) I think the text for a and b are switched in the figure 2 description. a is the AUC figure and  b is the correlation figure. Further for figure a If the test sequences are natural sequences, is the identity score meaningless here? 7) From the supplement: “We skipped the 'starts with M' filter because very few of the sequences in these sets start with M, and did not subset by identity to closest training sequence.” This modification to the pipeline should be mentioned in the discussion of the external validation tests. Or they should speculate what would happen if they just added a M at the beginning of every sequence? 8) Looking at the figures in the supplement e.g. Fig 30 it seems like they had quantitative activity values. It would have been nice to discuss if there was any correlation between scores and activity for ranking purposes. Was this not included because of variance in the assay?

This work potentially adds new pieces to the complex AD puzzle, showing that brain ACE2 levels correlates with AD pathology in two different cohorts of humans. Furthermore, the study shows that the spatial distribution of ACE2 in the brain of humans differs from mice, which has important implications for translational studies.The manuscript is also very well written, so it was easy for me to understand the main hypothesis, methods, results and author's conclusions, although I don't completely agree with some interpretations. For example, I agree that ACE2 may play a role in AD pathophysiology. This is corroborated by previous data (discussed by the authors in lines 419-435) and new data from this present study, showing that brain levels of soluble ACE2 (sACE2) were positively correlated with Aβ and tau neuropathology in humans, but inversely correlated with cognitive scores. However, I have some concerns regarding the authors' hypothesis that higher levels of sACE2 in AD patients might contribute to higher risk of CNS SARS-CoV-2 infection. So I have some questions and suggestions that I would like to share (I hope they contribute to your study): Major points 1) The manuscript suggests that increased levels of ACE2 in individuals with AD may increase the risk of CNS SARS-CoV-2 infection, since the SARS-CoVs use ACE2 as entry point into host cells. However, no alterations was observed in the levels of membrane ACE2 (i.e. in detergent-soluble fractions), although  higher levels of sACE2 was reported. I believe that the role of sACE2 was not properly discussed in the paper, but this is fundamental for the interpretation of your results. a) Where are most of TBS-soluble ACE2 in the AD brain? Inside or outside the cell? New data on this could help in the interpretation of current findings. b) If the receptor predominates in the extracellular parenchyma, as suggested in the lines 451-455, would they be acting as a decoy receptor or increasing SARS-CoV-2 infection by presenting the virus to host cells? There is an interesting literature on this, with some conflicting findings, but relevant to this discussion. These points are important to understand whether higher levels  of sACE2 would be a detrimental or compensatory/protective mechanism. 2) In the present study,  the APOE4 allele was present in 45% of individuals with AD (vs. 9% in control group in the cohort #1; p < 0.01). Accordingly, APOE4 is the greatest  genetic risk factor for AD. Recent findings indicate that APOE4 also correlate clinically with COVID-19 severity through interaction with ACE2 and/or modulation of ACE2 expression (Signal Transduct Target Ther. 2022 Aug 1;7(1):261 / J Transl Med. 2023 Feb 9;21(1):103).  Thus, it would be interesting to assess whether APOE4 also influences brain levels of ACE2 in the cohorts. 3) It is important to provide information about the race/ethnicity of the individuals enrolled in the present study, since African Americans/Black and Hispanic populations are at higher risk to have AD and experience disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related mortality. Also, I think it is important to consider in the Discussion possible limitations of the study, such as not being able to measure the impact that medications for AD may have on ACE2 expression. Finally, I believe that in vitro experiments could greatly contribute to the understanding of possible cellular mechanisms by which Aβ and/or tau can affect ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection independent of other factors (e.g. age, obesity, DM, APOE genotype and some medications). Furthermore, I would like to emphasize my congratulations on the manuscript: it was an enjoyable read!

I really liked the clarity of the figures and the step-by-step explanation of each method used, as well as the confirmation of background information through the different methodologies.

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the disease COVID 19, various vaccines and treatments have been developed that have been shown to be effective in reducing risk and severity of clinical outcome. Some limitations of current COVID19 treatment options is the inconsistency of their therapeutic efficacy across strains as well as possible unknown off-targets. To address these concerns, the use of llama-derived nanobodies (Nbs) has become of interest. Nbs have been shown to have a high affinity and specificity for targets, therefore decreasing risk of effects coming from possible unknown off-targets. In this study, llama-derived Nbs capable of neutralizing several SARS-CoV-2 strains were identified. In the In vivo model, Nbs were indicated to effectively induce protection in several lung tissues including the brain. These findings suggest Nbs as possible therapeutic agents for protection and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Positive feedback. This paper looked at the exciting research area of advancement upon monoclonal antibodies through Nbs. The researchers did a thorough job of explaining the genomic structure of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the interaction occurring during the initial attachment phase (lines 58-66). An exciting advancement of this study was the identification and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Nbs. These findings were made more impressive with their consistency found among varying strains as well as in both in vivo and in vitro design models. The use of several strains is important as individual strains can have very different effects and outcomes. The figures were nice with the appropriate size (not too small) being used for readability and the layout was not overwhelming with not too many figures being placed together (example Figure 3). I also liked the color scheme used as even though similar ones were used, varying shades were used to clearly contrast such as magenta as opposed to a lighter pink (example Figure 3 D). I especially liked Figure 10 for its ability to encapsulate a lot of information. The authors did a good job of explaining their research to those outside the field. The methods used to derive antibodies was well explained and will be helpful for those who would like to expand upon the research using this methodology. Major Concerns Different sources of S protein were used for different immunization points. Example the first two immunizations used were from one source and then third immunization is obtained using S protein from a different source. Moreover, they mention that the S protein parts encoded on expressed vectors are slightly different, how? (page 5 line 110) Authors should provide more detail into plasmids used, a table of recombinant proteins being used would be good. This is important as it probably represents the variability observed in Figure 2 when showing S protein binding of nanobodies. For Figure 6, an interpretation was not given in the discussion. It was mentioned that the Delta variant was not able to be neutralized by any of the non-RBD binders (pg. 11 line 279), but the researchers did not revisit this to share any hypothesis as to why this might be happening. In Figure 2, it might be good to see raw data and a correlation coefficient (R^2) to see how good the fit is. It might be helpful to include Km in the figure instead of just in a table. Proper positive controls in protection experiments are missing. For example, protection against various SARS-CoV2 variants with new nAbs could be compared with existing tools, e.g., mAbs used in clinic and/or current antivirals. Otherwise, it is hard to know whether the new tools are better than existing ones. Minor concerns The researchers briefly discussed ways in which their current work could be expanded upon (line 443-446), but did not mention the current limitations of their study. Discussing limitations is helpful for the reader in better understanding the results from the paper. What are some other routes that nanobodies can be introduced into the mouse besides intranasally? Will this route translate to humans? Full organs were used for calculating SARS-CoV2 titers. Was different localization of the virus seen in different areas of the brain? It might be interesting to discuss if they saw any differences and suggest this as a future direction. https://www.nature.com/arti... Figure 2 A-data points for NB-45 are difficult to see. Perhaps the data and the fits could be divided into classes instead of all in one figure. Figure 4 B, it is not made clear why the concentrations of nanobodies being used was chosen. Example NB-39 and Nb-43 is at 10 ug while the other nanobodies are administered at 20ug. It would be good to be more clear about the criteria for mice to be euthanized (such as the amount of weight needed to be lost). Some of the weight loss seems to be small (according to our standards) for euthanization. Figure 4 legend could include the amount of mice (assume 5), but this is not clear. In Figure 2, the variability of Nbs binding to Spike protein is very different (2A.) This is in contrast to the little variability noted between Nbs binding to RBD (2B.) This finding is not discussed in the paper. This may not need to be expanded upon, but I was curious why 4 days post-challenge was chosen to harvest tissues to evaluate the effect of nanobodies on virus titers (line 716 pg.28). It would be good to compare this time point to other time points. Do you have samples from surviving mice that you could look back at? In Figure 5, are the statistical values noted in Figure 4 also supposed to apply to Figure 5? Also, the significant difference between treatment groups in the same tissues with different letters is noted in figure legend 5, but it is somewhat confusing what is meant. More clarification in the figure legend would be helpful. The discussion portion did not reference all figures that were discussed.

I think that open discourse is an important part of the scientific enterprise. I have provided responses to your major points below: We are unsure what new information the plots in Figures 1G and 1H provide relative to Figures 1E and 1F. It makes sense that the 2DTM SNR values plateau in the thicker lamella, as there is a larger region of undisturbed particles. However, because the 2DTM SNR is also included in Figures 1E and 1F in an untransformed and more intuitive coordinate frame, we are unsure what new interpretations come out of Figures 1G and 1H, and why this coordinate frame is necessary. Fair enough, we have had opposite comments from different people so ultimately decided to leave it in. We are trying to make what we see as clear as possible and lead into the following figures which show the data in the coordinate frame in G and H. Although Figure 3 shows that damage from FIB milling is distinct from typical radiation damage in cryoEM, the statement “This is consistent with a model in which the FIB-damaged targets have effectively lost a fraction of their structure, compared to undamaged targets, possibly due to displacement of a subset of atoms by colliding ions” currently relies solely on the use of 2DTM SNR as a measure. This could be more strongly supported by solving structures or 2D classes of LSUs from varying depths in the lamella to observe the damage. Solving these structures from the datasets and low pass filtering them to different spatial frequencies (as done in Figure 3) would be helpful to see if there are consistent changes at the molecular level that could explain the propagation of radiation damage as a result of displacement of atoms due to colliding Ga+3 ions. We thought about doing this. The trouble is that by averaging we lose the single molecule read out making it a bulk measurement which may obscure differences. This would look like a lower resolution reconstruction from particles at the edge, but we would not know whether this was because of preferential loss of high spatial frequencies or from less overall signal across all spatial frequencies. I agree that alternate methods for comparison are needed. I am open to suggestions of alternate single molecule readouts! Could we use changes in signal from a fluorophore? Figure 2A illustrates how variable 2DTM SNR values can be. Outlining potential workflows for experimental validation of this ribosome dataset and other datasets would be helpful for those wishing to benchmark cryo-FIB milling damage on their own particular system of interest. We agree, the boxplots don’t perfectly show the density of the data. This is why we performed Gaussian fits and reported the fit statistics to capture the distribution of the data. If there is insufficient data or it is skewed for some reason, the Gaussian fits will be poor. We encourage others to use this approach In the discussion section, the practical recommendation that particles more than 30 nm deep can be used for subtomogram averaging seems at odds with the earlier observation that damage can be seen up to 60 nm deep from each lamella surface. The reason why we say this is because there is a balance between total number of particles and the quality of the particles. Since the loss of information seems to be relatively evenly distributed across different spatial frequencies, and the number of particles in situ is often limiting, including these particles can contribute information to the reconstruction, we’ll just need more of them to get the same amount of signal. Excluding all damaged particles would only be an ideal strategy if there are enough undamaged particles to go to high resolution. The 2DTM approach and the estimation of radiation damage relies on the reduction in correlation between the ideal, undamaged template and SNR. Can there by any other reasons for a reduction in this correlation other than FIB milling and/or electron exposure? e.g. stacking of multiple particles in Z-direction in case of higher ice thicknesses leading to reduced detectability. This is something that we thought a lot about. Stacking multiple particles in Z does affect the detectability but it affects all particles, not just those on the edge. We also considered implantation of Ga+ ions causing distortions to the e beam, but that would not explain the relatively invariant signal loss across different spatial frequencies. The effect that we saw is consistent with the expected effect from a series of collisions causing local deviations in atomic positions, which is consistent with what has been described in the materials science literature, so this is what we said. Of course it is always possible that there are alternatives that we have not considered! Investigating the mechanism in detail will require further work, this is only the beginning. The fact that the damage makes it impossible to pick entire particles suggests that the scale of radiation damage due to Gallium ions makes the entire particle explode. Are there any instances in which you see differential damage meaning that only a part of the particle is damaged and the rest is intact? I would expect this since different parts of particle are exposed at different points along Y axis. Otherwise, it can be concluded that the damage is always of “whole” particles but there is no conclusion clearly stating this. This could be worth exploring. It would be very difficult to look at the signal from parts of the molecule in single particles. We are still limited by the low dose regime just like in single particle cryo-EM. The lack of detection does not necessarily mean the particle is completely destroyed. This goes to the difficulty in detecting particles with 2DTM. We use a 2DTM SNR threshold to identify significant detections and avoid false positives. Lack of detection in this case does not mean that the particle is completely destroyed, only that it is below the threshold where we can effectively make a call relative to noise. Closer to the surface the particles have a higher chance of being exposed to multiple rounds of collision cascades. Figure 3F: it is well established that at low scattering angles, the electron scattering factors of negatively charged atoms can be negative. Was this considered when calculating the SNR from phosphorous atoms in the phosphodiester bond? This would have been something to consider for the negatively charged oxygens in the phosphate. We only considered the phosphorous atoms in this case. I hope this answers your questions! Always happy to discuss more online or offline. This paper aims to set out a way of thinking about and approaching the question of FIB damage. I agree that it is an important area and there is much more work to be done to understand the mechanism in more detail!

We sincerely appreciate your engagement with our research and the valuable perspective you have shared. 1.	As for the first point raised, indeed, our method cannot be extended to models that include random slopes. In the new version of the manuscript, this is explicitly stated and presented as a limitation. ""Nevertheless, despite not being exhaustive, we believe that having the ability to model crossed random intercepts is a better solution compared to ignoring the variability of items."" Regarding the permutation scheme, we apologize if it was not very clear, but we now explicitly state that the permutation was performed within subjects and items. 2.	We assumed that PermFull could be considered as the gold standard, as we have no reason to doubt it. In fact, the cluster-based correction operates on the statistics, which should not depend on the specific statistical method used to generate them (it is a correction for multiple comparisons, not an NHST method). However, since there is no existing literature on this, we evaluated the performance of PermFull, which we present in the supplementary materials of the new manuscript. PermFull showed a power of .821 (that is, better than other methods to correct for multiple comparisons: uncorrected: .875; Bonferroni: .370; FDR: .486), a precision of .868 (uncorrected: .735; Bonferroni: 1; FDR: .984), a false positive rate (FPR) of .017 (uncorrected: .044; Bonferroni: 0; FDR: .001), and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of .823 (uncorrected: .772; Bonferroni: .583; FDR: .667). 3.	Even considering an estimated time of 2 ms per Linear Mixed-Effects Model (LMM) computation, even with a relatively simple LMM model, the analysis of a standard dataset (64 channels x 500 time points) with 2000 permutations would require approximately 1.5 days. This number of permutations is considered the minimum recommendation to obtain reliable estimates of alpha. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that Julia is not commonly utilized for EEG data analysis, especially when compared to more widely used tools such as Matlab. We would like to thank you once again for your constructive comments, which we believe have allowed us to improve the manuscript.

COMMENT 1 Firstly, I would like to congratulate the authors on their study. I really love the inventiveness of the experimental set up! The results are really unexpected. The finding that phosphate starvation proceeds ABA mediated drought responses is interesting on a mechanistic basis and will likely have direct implications for crop management practices. The field-to-lab experimental pipeline looks really effective and I look forward to more people taking up this approach. RESPONSE 1 Firstly, we would like to apologize for the very late reply. Thank you so much for your interest in our research and your positive evaluation. Our data presented here showed that PSR response occurs earlier than ABA response under mild drought. We used to study drought stress in artificially controlled environments, but we have always been interested in what happens in the actual field, at the molecular level. We had heard a lot about the lab-to-field concept, but we would like to take our research from the field to the lab. The first and corresponding authors have actually interviewed farmers about drought conditions around the world, collaborated with drought researchers around the world, and traveled to drought research sites to see the realities. In listening to such voices in the field, we have been warming up our thoughts about what we should do as plant molecular biologists for a long time. Each year we conduct field trials of mild drought induction by ridges in soybean in the same way as in the paper, and we hope to find many new and important mechanisms in many more years of data. We would appreciate your continued advice, comments, and guidance. COMMENT 2 I do have a couple of points that I believe the authors could discuss in more depth. In their ridge trials, the geometry of the soil may play a role. Phosphate starvation induces a lot of lateral roots close to the soil surface, to maximise phosphate capture. In the ridge set-up, lateral roots are restricted to only a single plane. Is it possible that this contributes to the PSR in ridge-grown plants? It is also possible that increased rooting depth under mild-drought treatment also reduces phosphate uptake. If the authors see a reduction in PSR gene expression after re-watering ridge plants, this may help to rule out geometric explanations. It should be noted that the pot experiments do already indicate this to some extent. RESPONSE 2 Thank you for your interesting comments. Since the beginning of the ridge system, we have always carefully examined the possibility of unintended effects, such as changes in root morphology, caused by mild drought in the ridge system. In this light, we showed that irrigation compensates for the growth reduction caused by ridges (Fig. 2) , suggesting that various factors, such as slight changes in root shape due to ridges, are not substantially affected. As you also mentioned, we also used pot tests to substantiate our conclusions, as it is sometimes difficult to perform detailed molecular physiological analyses using only ridges. We therefore have analyzed Pi and ABA levels and PSR gene expression after re-hydration from pot tests with different plant species and soil types and have obtained results that can rule out geometric explanations, which we will update soon. COMMENT3 I am also not so sure about the authors’ conclusion on why PSR is induced at mild drought but suppressed under severe drought “Under severe drought conditions, given the circumstantial evidence, our observations would support the notion that PSR induction is suppressed by a relative increase in Pi concentration due to a decrease in leaf water content (Fig. 4).” I would argue an alternative, more straight forward hypothesis, that plants simply prioritise drought stress over this level of phosphate starvation when drought is severe. Would the authors expect to see a recovery of the PSR if Pi levels dropped even lower? RESPONSE 3 Thank you for pointing this out. We have also analyzed Pi and ABA levels and PSR and ABA-responsive gene expressions in response to changes in soil moisture content to demonstrate whether this hypothesis is true and will update the data soon. Research on the link between PSR and mild drought is just getting started, so future in-depth studies may provide data to support your hypothesis. COMMENT 4 Once again, thanks to the authors for their very through-provoking study! I look forward to hearing from you, Scott RESPONSE 4 We greatly appreciate your great interest and appreciation of our work.

I also enjoyed your thorough experiment designs and well-organized figures. However, I have a few comments regarding your figures and the statistical methods used in this paper. 1. Figure 3 C-D and F-J: I noticed an inconsistency in the statistical method used. In the Methods section, you mentioned that an unpaired t-test was used, but in the figure legends, you indicated that statistics were calculated using a paired t-test. Since you were comparing two independent groups, an unpaired t-test would be the correct test to employ. 2. Figure 3 D, H, and J: You indicated that a t-test was used. However, given that a t-test is a parametric test that requires data to be normally distributed, and there were a significant number of outliers in your figures, it could be better if you provided the Shapiro-Wilks normality test results to prove that your data were indeed normally distributed, or considered using non-parametric tests if your data were not normally distributed. 3. Figure 3B: In the Results section, you concluded that the innate immune response was more responsible for impaired growth of COX-2 deficient tumors, but you only compared the NK population and CD8+ T population given the information from Figure 3B. Therefore, it could be better if you refined your conclusion. 4. Figure 4F: The data were clearly right-skewed, so it could be better if you considered using non-parametric tests or provided the Shapiro-Wilks normality test results if the data were indeed normally distributed. 5.

Some general stats-related and stylist comments I had were: 1) In Figure 5h, the significance level of the difference between the Gzmb mRNA quantity of anti-PD-1 and celecoxib was shown as ""0.05"", which should probably have been ""n.s."" since the figure legend only defined significance levels for p-values less than 0.05. In addition, the significance level was shown for anti-PD-1 and the combination treatment for Ifng and Gzmb, but not for Prf1 and Cd40 (instead the significance level for celecoxib and the combination treatment was shown). I was a little confused by this inconsistency since the main conclusion of Figure 5 was that celecoxib increases efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment, for which I thought it would be better to show the significance levels of the differences between anti-PD-1 and the combination treatment for all four anti-tumor genes (as you did in Figure 6f). 2) I was also a little confused by the visualization of Figure 5g, specifically what exact comparisons correspond to the significance levels shown. The figure legend mentioned that a two-way ANOVA was performed but I thought perhaps a one-way ANOVA would be more appropriate since it seems that only a single type of T cells for different treatments were compared with one another. The results section could also explain a bit more regarding this figure that could clear up any confusion. 3) For all the ANOVAs performed, it would be helpful to specify which post-hoc you performed. 4) Just stylistically, it would be helpful if each figure could be followed by its own figure legend to make it easier to interpret the figures.
