The problem is that the sorts of details in this work never get into plankton models. This disparity between especially omics and models has been raised most recently by Flynn et al. (2025) https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-025-02788-3. It would be really helpful for you to flag how this work could usefully inform next generation plankton models. My second point concerns 'mixotroph'. From the tone of the discussion on this point, I assume you refer to photo-phagotrophy, as undertaken by mixoplankton. The problem with 'mixotroph' is that diatoms are strongly mixotrophic, via photo-osmotrophy (a trait well studied back in the 1960's etc. and exploited in algal biotech). I suggest that you consider using 'mixoplankton' to identify those organisms which are photo-phagotrophic. Checking organisms against the contents of the Mixoplankton Data Base of Mitra et al. (2023) https://doi.org/10.1111/jeu.12972, may help as this catalogues trophic modes and many other features of these organisms.",2025-10-22T06:16:15,kj_flynn,KJ Flynn,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.14.594221v1#comment-6785383363,biorxivstage,0,"This study by Bento et. al (2024) revealed that both Anopheles mosquitoes and plasmodium parasites are influenced by rhythms that have evolved to synchronize in order to optimize infection and transmission timing within the hole. Researchers asked whether the biological clocks helped the organism anticipate blood meals and modulate, parasite behavior, which would ultimately affect malaria transmission. There are three primary findings in this paper. The first finding was that roughly half of the mosquito salivary gland transcriptome exhibit 24 hour rhythmic expression. The expression peaks occurred twice daily once early in the day and once early in the night, which alliance with the gnome mosquito feeding patterns. These changes persist in both light/dark (LD) and constant darkness (DD) conditions. This was an indication that the genes in the salivary glands were driven by an internal circadian clock rather than by light cues or environmental factors. The second finding is that the Plasmodium sporozoite in the salivary gland also show cyclic transcription, that included cells involved in motility and host cell invasion. The authors ruled out the possibility that the observed rhythmic expression could be due to changes in sporozoite numbers due to replication or migration. After using immunofluorescence to visualize sporozoites at specific time points and testing for DNA replication, they found no evidence that replication explained the cyclic patterns. These results strengthened to idea that both mosquito and parasite are synchronized by daily cycles. Lastly, the found that mosquitoes are more likely feed at night and ingest more blood. Mice infected with sporozoites at night show higher liver parasites loads than mice infected during the day, indicating that sporozoites more infective at night. Together, these results suggest that the mammalian host, Plasmodium parasite and the Anopheles mosquito have evolved coordinated daily rhythms that maximize transmission success. The paper’s central contribution is the discovery that both the Anopheles mosquito vector and the Plasmodium parasite operate under circadian control and that their biological rhythms are synchronized to optimize malaria transmission. A critique that I would give to the main contribution is that experiments use Anopheles mosquitoes and Plasmodium berghei (a rodent malaria model). While appropriate for a controlled lab setting, it does not fully represent human malaria species or the natural mosquito environment. Conducting similar experiment in the future on human malaria parasites and field collected mosquitoes would strength relevance to the human population. If I were to write the significance of the paper on a 1-5 scale, I would give it a 4. It provides an important discovery with clear implication for control strategies. Overall, the methodology is mostly convincing. The researchers sampling every 4 hours, replication cross LD and DD conditions and combined transcriptomic and proteomic approaches provide a strong support for the presence of rhythmic gene expression. However, I have some questions about the results. The paper shows differences in expression levels between LD and DD conditions. What explains the discrepancies. This study would benefit from more discussion or experiments that addressed the source of LD and DD differences. Also, not all genes within the sporozoite showed clean cyclic patterns. For example, p52, CS, and AMA-1, displayed irregular or weak oscillations. It would be helpful if the authors addressed whether their irregulars reflect true biological variability or something external among the sporozoites. Also, a direct manipulation of clock components would strength the link between salivary gland genes and sporozoites. The most important limitation is generalizability. This study’s experiments focused on rodent-parasite/mosquito system under controlled conditions. This makes it unclear whether the observed data of rhythmic gene expression operates identically in natural setting with human malaria species and diverse mosquito environments. I would rate the writing 3/5 for clarity. The method’s section was dense and difficult to follow in some parts. There were technical terms and procedural details that were not fully explained for a non-specialist reader. For example. algorithms were named (e.g., ARSER, JTK_CYCLE), but a brief, plain-language description of what each contributes would help readers unfamiliar with circadian statistics. Also, some of the figures lacked proper labeling so it as hard to interpret what the data without having to refer back to the paper.  However, the abstract, introduction, results and discussion were readable and logically organized. Overall, the paper reframes malaria as a time-dependent system in which the vector, parasite and host rhythms are important for infection and transmission. Practical implication includes creating strategies that uses this knowledge such as insecticide spraying, bed-net use or prophylactic drug delivery to disrupt transmission timing. Moreover, this study can extend to other vector-borne disease such as Zika and dengue. Ultimately, this research contributes to the growing appreciation that temporal organization is central to biological function.",2025-10-21T05:01:38,beatrice_opoku,Beatrice Opoku,,,,

I had a few questions: Since the analysis reuses public datasets, could upstream biases affect PCN estimates? Did you try any sensitivity checks? Many assemblies don’t include clear isolation/source info. If metadata are available, would stratifying by source (clinical vs environmental, host/body site) change the main patterns? Some taxa (e.g., E. coli/Enterobacterales) seem over-represented. Do the size–PCN trend and the ~2.5% DNA-load rule still hold after down-sampling or re-weighting? Do you plan a small wet-lab validation or tests in more distant taxa to see how broadly these rules generalize? Thanks again—really exciting direction!",2025-10-21T03:59:01,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,,,,

I really appreciated how comprehensive the explanations were for each methodology. The decision-making made a lot of sense through the narrative presented, especially with the supplemental figures. It was very interesting to see how your results led to the conclusion that IFNα induction contributes to LAMV attenuation. At the end of the discussion, you mention the possibility of alternative vaccination options for those who are immunocompromised. What do you think those alternatives would look like? Would it be further attenuating the current LAMV, or would it use a different vaccine vector altogether? In the introduction, you noted the current cultural rise in vaccine hesitancy. Given its impact on recent vaccine uptake trends, I’m curious what you would consider the best method to effectively communicate this work’s findings to those who are vaccine hesitant. Is there anything you think is particularly compelling that could be communicated to the general public, particularly the vaccine hesitant or science skeptical crowd? Finally, I’d like to leave a small suggestion: would you consider adjusting some of the figures to a more colorblind-friendly palette of colors (particularly for Figure 1E)? This could help make some of the figures’ details easier to distinguish and make your research more accessible to a wider audience.

I found the logical flow of the experiments quite smooth and elegant, starting with mosquitoes and the parasites and finally the hosts, as well as using the methods of sequencing and behavioural studies. I also appreciated the comprehensive approach that connects the efficiency of malaria transmission to the genetic and behavioural aspects between the host, vector and parasite. I particularly liked how you incorporated both mRNA sequencing and proteomic analyses to strengthen your conclusions, though it might help to clarify some figures (e.g., clearer axis labeling in hierarchical clustering and heat maps, discussing patterns in heat maps) and discuss potential experimental limitations, such as the frequency of proteomic sampling and how experimental settings, such as the single-bloodmeal design differs from natural conditions.

Your work provides remarkable insight into how circadian rhythms influence malaria transmission, connecting parasite, vector, and host biology in a way that could reshape how we think about disease timing and control strategies. One question I have is regarding the difference in the number of peaks and the timing of peak expression activity between the mosquitoes and the sporozoites shown in fig. 1F and fig. 3C. I’m interested in what you make of the discrepancy. Why might it be advantageous for sporozoites to have a peak expression in the early morning while most of the Anopheles activity occurs. The fact that the peak expressions are synched between the sporozoites suggests that they are synched by external stimulus. However, for an immature parasite that likely lacks photoreceptors and was raised under constant temperature, I’m really curious what type of stimulus could affix or synchronize its circadian rhythm. I really enjoyed reading this thought-provoking piece of work.",2025-10-21T02:02:37,fumingmeng,Fuming Meng,,,,

The study also highlights RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) as potential key regulators of developmental gene expression changes in T. cruzi. The main contribution is the creation of the first comprehensive scRNA-seq atlas of T. cruzi, which provides a high-quality resource for understanding life cycle transitions. This dataset provides a foundational reference that future studies can use to build new RNA-seq experiments and explore regulatory mechanisms in parasite development. The primary limitation is that the study is descriptive rather than mechanistic. The authors identify candidate regulators and stage-specific genes but do not experimentally test their functional roles, leaving relationships unproven. Overall, this is a technically strong and biologically revealing preprint that significantly advances the research field of the life cycle of the T. cruzi.

First, the authors nicely identified the key mechanism of attenuation — an early and strong IFN-α response that limits measles virus replication. I also like how they combined in vivo and in vitro experiments, which makes the findings much more convincing. And finally, the study not only explains why the measles vaccine is safe and long-lasting, but also gives useful insights for designing new live or IFN-sensitive vaccine platforms. That said, there are still a few details that could be improved. For example, in Figure 1a–b, it’s not very clear why the authors only used TECs and PBMCs as models instead of including other cell types. It’s also not explained why they only collected the supernatant from TECs but measured both the supernatant and cell fractions in PBMCs. In Figure 4, the macaque experiment only shows viral RNA and cytokine changes in BAL and PBMCs, but lacks tissue-level analysis like immune cell infiltration or histology. Lastly, the study doesn’t really discuss the adaptive immune response, which is important since long-term immune memory is a major feature of the measles vaccine. Overall, I think it’s an excellent paper with strong data and meaningful findings, but there are still some details that could be clarified or expanded to make it even stronger.",2025-10-21T00:06:41,,CDSL comment,,,,

The abstract in this paper is very clear as it provides both background information and key findings. One thing I suggest is considering adding a short summary of methods used so the audience can get a basic idea about how you study the mechanisms of circadian rhythms. For the method section, I have some questions: 1)Why do you choose to dissect the salivary glands of mosquitos every 4 hours instead of with other time intervals? Are there previous studies or specific mechanisms in mosquito biology that support 4-hour interval is most optimal for this study? 2) I think other factors such as moisture and temperature may also play a role in altering circadian rhythms in mosquitos. Have you considered incoporate those factors in future studies? If so, how will you control them in a laboratory setting? 3) For this study, is it necessary to include a group of uninfected mosquitos as control? I think it'd be better to have them so you can have a baseline to compare with because circadian rhythms may be affected by the parasites. Lastly, I wonder how the parasites know the mosquito's circadian rhythm and adjust their own gene expression accordingly? Are there specific communication mechanisms or signaling pathway that may contribute to this coordination between mosquitos and parasites?",2025-10-20T23:35:34,adakou,Ada Kou,,,,

The authors choose 2 models and use them to validate a clear post-entry restriction for LAMV. They separate entry/transcription from productive replication with layered readouts and align these with signaling kinetics (p-STAT1/2, ISGs), so the causal link to rapid IFN-α activation feels credible rather than assumed. Figures and statistics are proportional to the claims, and the writing stays close to the data, avoiding overreach.    I have one question for IFN-β, the data emphasize IFN-α (transcripts/protein and signaling), and IFN-β appears lower, but its functional contribution is not directly excluded.Do you plan to do more experiment to further exclude IFN-β?",2025-10-20T22:16:51,cdslyining,CDSL-YINING,,,,

Typical diploid organism experimental design studying a specific genotype for expression involves using a homozygous wild-type (+/+), heterozygous mutant with one copy of the allele (+/-), and a homozygous mutant with the gene knocked out (-/-). This study only utilized Arabidopsis ahk5-1 (Col-0) as their homozygous mutant and compared the treatment with the wild-type homozygous Arabidopsis. Why was the heterozygote not included in the study? Is there any phenotypic difference between the WT and the knockout strain? Growth rates, appearance, stress tolerance, etc.? If the AHK5 gene is critical in signaling during stress, there should be a phenotype of deficient stress tolerance. The experimental design also did not involve replicants or parallel experiments during the metabolic labeling procedures Another problematic issue is the type of water used. During the treatment stage, the control “mock” treatment added an equivalent amount of water to the seedlings but does not specify the type of water (i.e. DI water vs. tap). Later, after incubation of the treatment methods, the seedlings are rinsed specifically with tap water. Components of tap water vs. DI water can have differences in mineral content and affect the protein extraction results. The protein extraction procedure was modified where instead of grinding in a mortar and pestle as per procedures established2,3, the liquid nitrogen frozen plant matter was coarsely crushed. The reasoning for this was not established. During the proteome quantification procedure, hits to contaminants were excluded. Why was this? Contaminants added during the procedures could remain undetected because of this. References (1)	Drechsler, T.; Li, Z.; Schulze, W. X.; Harter, K.

The authors present a coherent body of evidence showing that LAMV, unlike wild-type measles virus (MeV), triggers an early, robust type I interferon response (dominated by IFN-α) in primary human PBMCs; this response correlates with a post-entry block in infectious particle formation. The experimental program is broad and well-integrated: bulk RNA-Seq, targeted protein analyses (TBK1/IRF3/IRF7/STAT1), cytokine profiling, functional IFN pathway blockade, reverse genetics and validation in rhesus macaques.Using a combination of primary human PBMCs, differentiated rhesus tracheal epithelial cells, reverse genetics, and an in vivo macaque model, the authors show that LAMV uniquely triggers an early and robust type I interferon response dominated by IFN-α in immune cells. The data are coherent across molecular, functional, and animal-model levels and together provide a compelling model that innate immune activation rather than an inherent replication defect is the dominant driver of LAMV attenuation. The study has several notable strengths. It is a multi-layered experimental design.Use of primary human PBMCs and an in vivo macaque model is especially important, since the attenuation phenotype is largely invisible in immortalized cell lines that have compromised interferon responses. The integration of genetic (mutation) data with host-response profiling produces a clear and translationally relevant mechanistic narrative that is likely of interest to both virologists and vaccine developers. The paper shows that innate IFN responses tied to specific mutations drive attenuation has broad implications for rational live-vaccine design and safety considerations (including immunocompromised hosts). It is not a paradigm-shifting discovery for immunology generally, but it is a significant, field-advancing contribution to vaccine virology. There is however one concern that I have is that, although macaque experiments add in vivo relevance, intratracheal infection may not fully model the subcutaneous/intramuscular context of human vaccination; additional delivery-route experiments would bolster translational claims. Overall speaking about the format , the preprint is well organized and easy to follow and the Methods and Supplementary files provide sufficient technical detail to reproduce the core experiments. Figures are logically ordered to match the results narrative, and most figure legends succinctly summarize what is shown.This paper suggests a shift in thinking about live-attenuated vaccine design attenuation can be achieved deliberately by engineering viruses to induce targeted innate responses (especially type I IFNs) while retaining sufficient antigen expression to drive durable adaptive immunity. That concept could guide rational design of next-generation live vaccines or adjuvant strategies.Overall, this is an important and timely study that links viral genetics and host innate immunity to vaccine attenuation.",2025-10-19T16:17:06,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,,,,

Using rigorous in vitro and in vivo models, the authors demonstrate that, unlike wild-type measles, LAMV infection of primary human immune cells induces a potent innate response driven by IFNα, effectively inhibiting viral replication and spread. Furthermore, by co-infection of PBMCs and rhesus macaque cells, they clearly demonstrate that LAMV can enter cells and initiate transcription but is unable to produce progeny virus, consistent with its robust innate sensing capabilities. One question is how these acute innate signals influence vaccine immunogenicity: the authors note that LAMV also triggers rapid release of proinflammatory cytokines in PBMC cultures and rhesus macaques, which may contribute to the initiation of adaptive immunity. It would be helpful if the authors could elaborate on whether and how the early IFNα and cytokine responses they observed contribute to the long-term protective immunity elicited by LAMV (e.g., by enhancing antigen presentation or memory formation). Overall, this well-executed study provides a compelling mechanistic framework explaining why LAMV is both safe and highly immunogenic, and the proposed elucidation will further strengthen the link between innate responses and vaccine efficacy.",2025-10-17T18:35:43,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,,,,

Interestingly, these new data suggest that miR-1229-3p inhibition leads to lower mitochondrial activity and mitochondrial dysfunction, although not to the extent that mitophagy is increased, ultimately leading to altered Ca2+ regulation and dendritic arborisation. Despite this mitochondrial dysfunction, miR-1229-3p inhibition enhances synaptogenesis, and so this contrasts with Iwata et al. (ref. 32 in their manuscript) where it is reported that decreasing mitochondrial metabolism slows neuronal development. How can the authors’ findings be reconciled with Iwata et al.? Mito-ER interactions are considered in the discussion and indeed they mention that MERC regulation by miR-1229-3p could be a mechanism in human neurons contributing to slowing of mitochondrial metabolism and associated neuronal maturation. However, their findings don’t appear to support the premise that impaired mitochondrial metabolism slows neuronal maturation. I would be interested in additional discussion on this point. Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author): The authors have sincerely addressed all reviewer comments, and the revised manuscript is considered to be of a much higher quality compared to the initial submission. While they have not performed a specific experiment for every point I suggested, their explanations for not doing so are convincing, which I find acceptable.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.22.677690v1#comment-6782553111,biorxivstage,0,"A recent study by Emond-Rheault et al. provided an extensive analysis of the coding and non-coding transcriptome of Leishmania infantum developmental stages using Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (PMID: 40597600). The considerable depth of their sequencing—achieving 5.2 to 6.9 million reads and approximately 150-190% genome coverage for both promastigote and amastigote stages—enabled statistically powerful comparative studies. Their work precisely determined the primary spliced leader (SL) and poly(A) sites for the majority of L. infantum protein-coding transcripts, accurately defining their 5’ and 3’ ends and the lengths of their UTRs. It also provided further evidence for SL cleavage site motifs and better defined the genomic context for cleavage and polyadenylation. The accuracy of the transcriptome annotation was supported by cross-validation with Illumina RNA-Seq. Furthermore, the study quantified the frequency of primary SL and poly(A) sites and compared alternative polyadenylation events between the developmental stages. Additionally, this analysis uncovered a rich repertoire of newly annotated lncRNAs, which generally exhibit distinct expression patterns from their cognate 3’UTRs. The protein-coding potential of a subset of these lncRNAs was rigorously investigated by LC-MS/MS and the expression of proteins of selected lncRNAs was confirmed using CRISPR–Cas9-mediated tagging and western blot analysis. Several of these lncRNAs are developmentally regulated, showing higher expression in amastigotes, underscoring their potential importance during intracellular development. The current work by Dumetz et al., which combines PacBio HiFi de novo assembly with Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing of Leishmania donovani promastigotes and axenic amastigotes, would be greatly strengthened by considering the recent study on L. infantum. A comparative analysis between these two closely related species could address compelling biological questions regarding gene expression, UTR conservation and length, RNA processing, and the presence of known and novel 3’UTR regulatory motifs. However, the low number of Nanopore reads obtained for L. donovani axenic amastigotes (only 648,426) drastically reduces the statistical power and reliability of comparative analyses between the two life stages. The discovery of putative RNA G-quadruplexes in over 56% of L. donovani 3’UTRs is a novel finding. It would be interesting to investigate whether these sequences are conserved in the 3’UTRs of the closely related L. infantum. Nonetheless, in the absence of experimental validation, it is premature to suggest these motifs are main drivers of post-transcriptional regulation, particularly given the many other validated 3’UTR regulatory elements known in Leishmania spp. It is a limitation that the authors did not search for these established elements in their analysis. Finally, the crucial role of 3’UTRs in controlling mRNA fate in Leishmania has been widely documented, and it is regrettable that the authors did not discuss their findings within this broader context. I hope these suggestions are helpful in strengthening the study. Respectfully,",2025-10-15T00:31:44,,Gabriel Ferreira,,,,

Our publication focuses on the nonimmune incompatibility between two species, which is why we concentrated on compromised oxygen delivery between mother and fetus. I have read the paper you mentioned and completely agree that multiple mechanisms were most likely involved in the decline of archaic populations. While Piezo1 also defines a blood group, the amino acids responsible for blood group type are located in the extracellular domain and do not influence Piezo1 channel properties (PMID: 36122374, Figure 4) or, consequently, RBC metabolism. The choice of the Ser307Gly variant was inspired by Svante Pääbo’s lecture, in which he compared archaic protein variants with modern ones based on 1000 Genomes data. A list of the proteins can be found in the supplementary materials of PMID: 24679537. At that time, protein alleles with low frequencies (<1%) were not detectable in such a small sample of modern genomes. The Ser307Gly variant appears to have undergone negative selection. For example, the archaic allele of a Piezo1-linked gene, MC1R, reached up to 70% in some East Asian populations (PMID: 24916031), but the archaic Piezo1 variant is absent in these individuals, as genomic data were obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project. Another archaic allele of Piezo1, E1839K, is preserved at higher frequencies. I did not verify this variant in archaic genomes, but its designation as archaic is based on comparative analysis. Approximately 5% of Asians (gnomAD) and all other modern hominid species carry K instead of E, reflecting a prevalence rate more consistent with neutral expectations for an archaic allele. Thank you for mentioning Denisovans. I did not examine their sequence, but I would expect that most archaic humans carried this variant, particularly if our hypothesis regarding the reproductive barrier is correct.",2025-10-14T15:48:16,asyamakhro,Asya Makhro,,,,

One analysis that could sharpen the biological interpretation of the ~10–11% EBV DNAemia group is per-individual, gene-level EBV coverage profiles. A simple addition could be: (1) Per-sample coverage heatmaps across the EBV genome (normalized depth, with masked loci excluded). (2) Summary indices contrasting latency-associated regions (e.g., EBNA1/2/3, LMP1/2, RPMS1/BARTs) vs lytic genes (BZLF1/BRLF1/BMRF1/BALF5/late capsid). (3) A “flatness/entropy” metric to distinguish uniform episomal coverage from focal peaks consistent with fragmentation or reactivation. It would really help interpretation because gene-level coverage tells you what biology you’re actually capturing in that ~10–11% tail. If coverage is flat across the EBV genome, that’s more consistent with cell-associated episomes and high-load latency; if you see focal enrichment over immediate-early/early/late loci, that points toward reactivation or fragmented cfDNA. That distinction changes how we read the HLA/ERAP2 signals (antigen presentation under lytic pressure vs control of latent burden), tightens the PheWAS (different disease links are expected for latent-heavy vs reactivation-enriched samples), and avoids over-generalizing a single “DNAemia” phenotype. It also matters for downstream hypotheses and clinical framing: a reactivation-prone subgroup suggests monitoring/treatment angles very different from stable latent carriage.

The paper is already accepted with few modifications from the version you see here, and it will be published soon. A 10:1 ratio as a rule of thumb seems a bit excessive. It is true that this reflects my results for 20 taxa for some combinations of TL and number of states, but in other combinations it seems like 100 characters are sufficient. Also, this ratio might get slightly smaller with more taxa. I think that the fairest answer would be that it really depends a lot on the dataset and on the properties of the sampled characters, but if one needs a universal rule-of-thumb ratio I would suggest something closer to 5:1. I did not explore how adding taxa impacts the estimate of the relationships of a few selected ""key"" taxa, but that is a very interesting idea. I cannot think right now about a mechanism that would actually improve the estimate for the ""key"" taxa, except maybe breaking up long branches. When I started to think about metrics to evaluate my simulation results, I did use both RF distance and CID. I noticed that the pattern of these two metrics relative to the varying parameters was very similar, so I ended up keeping only the RF distances because it was easier to explain those values intuitively and pick a threshold value. I am actually curious to know your take on what constitutes a ""good-enough"" CID value (satisfyingly accurate topology) for an estimated tree compared to the true tree. In the supplementary material of the final version of the manuscript, I do have included some PCoA plots of pairwise CID distances of posterior distributions, MAP trees, and true tree, to visually explore tree distances of the whole posterior compared to the true tree as a function of the number of characters. As for the convergence of the topologies, I honestly gave up on that because (especially for the 100-200 taxa trees) it was taking a VERY long time to calculate for ALL the simulations between-runs split frequencies and ESS in the convenience R package (I don't know about the speed of that in the treess package). The few simulation inferences that I managed to check seemed to converge fine on topology, and I don't see any particular reason why there would be systematic convergence problems on the other simulations (the model is very simple, it is correctly implemented/validated, and it matches how the data was generated). I do totally agree that checking topological convergence should be an important part of empirical phylogenetic analyses that is often neglected.",2025-10-09T13:57:32,disqus_AM6Kuv2CIm,Alessio,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.02.679940v1#comment-6780016777,biorxivstage,3,"In a recent preprint at bioRxiv (Yang et al., https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.02.679940), a group of authors led by Dr Anjali Kusumbe challenges an article from my lab published in 2024 (Koh et al. 2024, PMID: 39537918). The new preprint refers to Extended Data Figures and Supplementary videos that are unfortunately not provided at bioRxiv. Nevertheless, the manuscript text and the 5 main figures plus a proposed model contain a couple of major issues that I will cover here. A thread containing my comments plus useful illustrations is available on X ( https://x.com/ralfhadams/status/1976179960558539006). But before I do so, let me give you a little background. Several papers over the recent years have proposed that the bone marrow (BM) in skull is specialized and acts as an immune cell reservoir for the brain parenchyma and the meninges, a multilayered tissue structure that encloses and protects the brain and spinal cord. Key evidence comes from landmark publications by the groups of Matthias Nahrendorf (Herisson et al. 2018, PMID: 30150661), Jonathan Kipnis (Cugurra et al. 2021, PMID: 34083447), Ali Ertürk (Kolabas et al. 2023, PMID: 37562402) and others. Kolabas et al. 2023, for example, provide compelling results showing that skull “has the most distinct transcriptomic profile compared with other bones in states of health and injury” with potential relevance for neurological pathologies. The same publication also reveals that skull shows a strong response to stroke, arguing for interactions between the brain and a nearby bone marrow compartment. Our paper from 2024 shows that the BM of skull is undergoing substantial expansion in adult life but also during aging, which applies both to stromal cells (including vasculature) and a large range of hematopoietic cell subsets including stem and progenitor populations. Our paper makes use of well-established immunolabeling and imaging enabled by the injection of antibodies into living animals before they were sacrificed for tissue isolation. The removal of external tissues, including the meninges/dura mater on the brain side and dermal tissue on the skin side enabled undisturbed insights into the organization and expansion of bone marrow vessels, which exhibit the distinct dilated and irregular morphology typical for the sinusoidal vasculature of the BM. It is also noteworthy (and will be relevant later) that the expansion of the BM vasculature starts in frontal and parietal bones at the edges (near the sutures) and gradually progresses toward to center in young adult mice (10-14 weeks), whereas the interparietal bone is already filled with vessels (and hematopoietic cells) at this stage. Apart from imaging, we provide an extensive set of flow cytometry data in a large (22 page) supplemental file accompanying the paper, which confirms the expansion of stromal, endothelial, total hematopoietic cells and various hematopoietic cell subsets during adulthood and aging but also in response to various challenges (such as pregnancy and stroke). But even the skull of older mice is not spared from signs of aging. We observe that the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines is elevated in old skull in comparison to samples from younger mice. However, this affects fewer cytokines and involves lower levels of upregulation relative to age-matched (young and old) femur samples. Functionally, we show that shielding of either the head or the hindlimb allows the survival of young mice exposed to a lethal dose of irradiation (without BM transplantation). In irradiated old mice, however, only shielding of the head ensures survival, whereas animals with shielded legs gradually succumb over a period of 200 days, presumably reflecting the exhaustion of hematopoietic stem cells and early progenitor populations. These results and other evidence presented in the article led us to the conclusion that skull BM is more resilient to aging than its counterpart in femur. Now, let’s take a look at some of the claims raised by Yang et al. in their recent bioRxiv preprint. In Figure 1, they have reanalyzed selected subsets of scRNA-seq data from our publication to show that samples from old skull show hallmarks of aging compared to young skull. It is not clear (and is not explained) why certain samples from our data (available at GEO under the accession number GSE275179) were included in their analysis whereas other, equally suitable samples were excluded. In any case, it is not surprising and also not controversial that cells from old skull show an increase of aging markers compared to samples from young mice. We have never claimed that the skull BM stays young forever and, instead, we have reported the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines mentioned earlier together with other evidence such as myeloid-biased hematopoietic differentiation. Figure 2 of the Yang et al. preprint shows a comparison of mass spectrometry data from young (10 weeks) and old skulls/calvaria (79 weeks), which also indicates that markers of DNA damage and inflammation are upregulated, whereas markers of angiogenesis, osteogenesis and mitochondrial activity are downregulated. One would have liked to see a more detailed description of the sample preparation (e.g., were the meninges and other adherent/external tissues removed from the skull samples?), but the findings themselves are not surprising or controversial. Of course, old tissue samples show evidence of aging and are different from young skull samples. Things heat up a little in Figure 3 of the Yang et al. preprint. The authors claim that a dense, continuous network of vessels is found throughout skull samples from all ages and thereby challenge our observation that the calvarial vasculature and BM are dynamically expanding in adult mice. The evidence provided by Yang et al. includes transversal sections through the skull roof. The low magnification overview images in Figure 3b are of poor quality/resolution so that it is not possible to see much detail. The DAPI nuclear staining in the higher magnification images, however, suggests that the enlarged areas primarily correspond to tissue near the sutures, which already contain vasculature and some BM even in young frontal and parietal bones. Clearly, one would like to see better quality overview images and an unbiased comparison of central vs. peripheral areas from frontal and parietal bones. Things get more interesting and controversial in Figure 3c and d. Yang et al. use tissue clearing and light sheet microscopy to show the presence of a “continuous, dense vascular network throughout the skull frontal, parietal and interparietal regions in young mice”. The CD31 immunostaining in Fig. 3a, however, shows predominantly the meningeal vasculature, easily identifiable by hallmarks such as the sagittal and transverse sinuses consisting of large diameter blood and lymphatic vessels. Periosteal vessels might be also labeled, but it is not obvious that any sinusoidal vessels of the bone marrow are stained in this sample. Higher magnification images in Fig. 3d show more details of the meningeal (and perhaps also periosteal) vasculature in mice from different age groups. Again, it is very obvious that sinusoidal vessels with their distinctive morphology and large caliber are not captured in these samples. This is not surprising because expression of CD31 is low in sinusoidal (also termed type L) endothelial cells, as previous work from my group has established (Kusumbe et al. 2014, PMID: 24646994). Taken together, it is clear that Yang et al. have not carefully separated the vasculature of the skull and the adjacent meninges, leading to confusing results and wrong conclusions. Future research in this important field needs to clearly distinguish what is bone marrow, periosteal tissue, meninges or the surface of the adjacent brain. There is another small but interesting nugget hidden in Fig. 3c of the Yang et al. preprint. The freshly dissected skull sample prior to clearing shows distinctive areas of red blood cells in the interparietal bone but also in parts of the frontal bone. Our work has revealed a similar pattern of red blood cell distribution, representing regions of bone marrow, in freshly dissected young skull. In samples from older mice, these areas increase substantially, confirming the expansion of calvarial BM even in the absence of any immunostaining. Kolabas et al. 2023 (PMID: 37562402) also show a strikingly similar distribution of Nr4a1+ and propidium iodide (PI) labeled immune cells in calvarial bone marrow of young adult mice. Note the absence of immune cells in central regions of the frontal and parietal bone, whereas labeled cells (blue and red) are abundant in the interparietal bone. This is totally consistent with our own findings. Unfortunately, the sample showing aged skull is not included in the Yang et al. bioRxiv preprint so that a further comparison of young and old bone marrow will have to wait until the Extended Data Figures become publicly available. Before I move on, I would briefly like to address a technical detail. In the Yang et al. bioRxiv preprint, the authors claim that our Endomucin staining shows “aberrant nuclear localization”, which, according to them, suggests “that the current staining is artefactual and calls into question the reliability of their vascular imaging data”. This is just one of many strongly worded claims in the preprint. In reality, however, the Endomucin immunostaining shown by Yang et al. in the preprint is strongly overexposed, preventing any insight into the actual intracellular distribution of the antigen. The red (Endomucin) signal covers pretty much every part of the stained cells. The impact of different imaging and data presentation modalities, whole-mount vs. tissue sections and maximum intensity projection vs. isolated optical planes, also need to be considered. Furthermore, I have already mentioned that our study has used an in vivo labeling approach involving the injection of antibodies before the animals were sacrificed. This might lead to a slightly different pattern in comparison to post-fixation staining. Nevertheless, it is unambiguously clear that the bone marrow vasculature is stained reliably in Koh et al. 2024 (PMID: 39537918), revealing striking details of vessel architecture and regional differences. Before I continue with the next figure of the preprint, let’s have a quick look what other recent publications say about skull bone marrow. Chang et al. 2025 (PMID: 40970910), using advanced tissue clearing and light sheet imaging, report bone marrow expansion in a comparison of 2-month-old and 2-year-old skull samples. The data shown in Figure 5 of their publication independently confirms that large parts of the young calvarium are devoid of VEGFR3+ sinusoidal vessels, whereas older samples show a profound expansion of vessels, consistent with our own findings. A recent publication from the group of Warren Graham (Horenberg et al. 2025, PMID: 39984434) reports that “Emcn+ vessels demonstrated drastic morphological changes with aging, as bone marrow-resident sinusoidal blood vessel signal increases with age”. A recent publication from the group of Shukri Habib (Reeves et al. 2024, PMID: 39692737) has evaluated calvaria from mouse of different age groups by micro-computed tomography and other methods. In Figure 1A+B and the corresponding text, they state that “overall thickness from outer surface to inner surface of the parietal bone significantly increased with age” and they also show a striking increase of cavities (which, as we know, represent bone marrow areas) compared to young and adult calvarial bone. Overall, there is more and more emerging evidence supporting that the bone marrow in adult skull is expanding dynamically in adult mice, which involves changes in sinusoidal vessels but also in stromal and hematopoietic cell populations. Let’s return to the preprint by Yang et al. with a focus on Figure 4, which is another reanalysis of scRNA-seq data from Koh et al. 2024 (PMID: 39537918). This time, the focus is initially on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and CD45+ cells from young and old femur samples. According to the figure legend, this analysis is based on three samples – one from young and two from old femurs – that were subjected to the removal of hematopoietic cells prior to single cell sequencing. This depletion method is necessary to capture and enrich stromal cell populations, but these are obviously not samples that one would use for the analysis of hematopoietic cells. The remaining hematopoietic cells are residual contaminating cells that have escaped the depletion step, which is never totally complete. I would dispute that the analysis of contaminating cells allows meaningful conclusions about the abundance/enrichment of hematopoietic cell populations in aging femurs, but this seems to be exactly what Yang et al. have done. Could they have selected the wrong samples from our deposited data or mixed up the sample numbers? Who knows? In this context, I would like to point out that we had provided a substantial amount of information about our scRNA-seq data, the pretreatment of the different samples and other aspects of our methodology per email to Dr Kusumbe in early June 2025. Back to the preprint and Figure 5, which provides bulk mass spectrometry data comparing proteins from old vertebra and skull, which led the authors of the preprint to the conclusion that vertebrae are relatively protected from aging hallmarks in comparison to skull. The description of the methodology is unfortunately very brief. It is not clear which vertebrae were analyzed exactly (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, or all?). It is also not clear whether adherent muscle, fat, spinal cord and intervertebral discs were removed, all of which should influence substantially what is seen in the proteomic profile. In any case, it is obvious that this analysis is not confined to bone marrow and functional data for BM cells from vertebrae in comparison to other BM compartments is lacking. Obviously, future work will have to address how aging processes affect different BM compartments and thereby the function of the hematopoietic system. We are almost done, but I want to highlight another controversial aspect in the Yang et al. preprint, namely the presence (or absence) of lymphatic vessels inside bone. Based on the reanalysis of our scRNA-seq data from Koh et al., it is claimed in Fig. 1 and the accompanying text that lymphangiogenic markers are downregulated in aged skull samples. I would dispute that the presence of Cdh5+ Pecam1+ Prox1+ Ptprc- Flt4+ endothelial cells in the data supports the presence of lymphatic endothelial cells inside the skull bone or marrow. Chang et al. 2025 (PMID: 40970910), a publication that was already mentioned earlier, have examined this question in detail and they state that lymphatic vessels are present outside the skull in the periosteum but not inside bone marrow. The preparation of samples of skull and other tissues for scRNA-seq analysis is a race against time because it is essential to preserve RNA integrity as much as possible. This means that the removal of adherent, periosteal tissue residues including lymphatic vessels from the meningeal or the dermal side has to be done quickly, is most likely incomplete and might lead to residual contaminations. Essentially, the proposed presence of putative lymphatic endothelial cells in our data, which we have not validated ourselves, cannot resolve where these cells originate from. I want to conclude here and thank all of you who have read this thread till the end. As I have not been able to cover all issues in the preprint, I am considering another detailed thread once the Extended Data becomes public. I also hope that I have remained factual and sufficiently polite throughout my posts even though I perceive the language in the Yang et al. preprint as sometimes overly harsh and many claims unsubstantiated and wildly exaggerated. Final full disclosure: I am not only the last author of Koh et al. 2024 (PMID: 39537918) but also the former postdoctoral supervisor of the two last authors of the Yang et al. preprint.",2025-10-09T07:16:25,ralfhadams,Ralf H.

It would seem that the ""baseline setting"" (Figure 2) is unfairly favoring the semi-supervised methods. The same labels are used as input to guide integration AND for performance evaluation; this allows ss-methods to overfit the data, especially scGen and scDREAMER, which have many parameters.  Wouldn't it make sense to report the rankings based on a more realistic scenario, such as one with partial annotation or partially incorrect labels? On another note, silhouette coefficients have been reported to be suboptimal for this kind of benchmarks, and more appropriate metrics have been proposed, see e.g. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02743-4",2025-10-08T15:32:30,,M.A.,,,,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.27.656061v1#comment-6779669946,biorxivstage,2,"Since I was asked to review this paper several months ago and waived my anonymity on review, I'm sharing my review publicly here as a comment. The TL/DR is that I think this paper is both very informative, and very important. However, it does need to be contextualized as a deep study of a recovery cohort, which is then being compared to public data from cohorts with a significant percentage of people who are not recovering, and that needs to be accounted for. Comparing immune cells from the PBMC fraction of blood of people who all went on to recover to cells from tissue of cohorts including those made up of 40% people who did not go onto recover does not allow for making conclusions about differences between the blood and the tissue without accounting for the differences in immune responses of those on a trajectory to recover and those who are not. Those immune responses could look very different, both in the blood and in the tissue. Here is my full review: This is an important and comprehensive study by Rostomily et al., ""Multiomics Reveals Compartmentalized Immune Responses and Tissue-Vascular Signatures in Lyme Disease,"" which significantly advances our understanding of the immunopathology of acute Lyme disease (LD). I found it easy to read, and the figures were clear and compelling. By employing a longitudinal, multiomics approach integrating plasma proteomics, metabolomics, and PBMC immunophenotyping, supplemented with a meta-analysis of skin lesion transcriptomics, the authors present a compelling narrative of compartmentalized immunity. They propose that the robust alterations in circulating plasma proteins and metabolites, linked to endothelial barrier stability, metabolic reprogramming, and symptom severity, are predominantly driven by local immune processes within the skin and associated vasculature, while systemic PBMCs remain largely quiescent. It is quite surprising to see the PBMCs and metabolites show such fast resolution, and it feels like this is likely related to the complete recovery seen in this cohort.  This work offers novel insights into effective immune responses against Borrelia burgdorferi and the kinetics of recovery from infection, particularly highlighting vascular involvement, and provides a valuable resource for future biomarker discovery and therapeutic development in LD. A critical aspect for the authors to address, perhaps in the limitations or discussion, is the high recovery rate observed in their patient cohort. The manuscript states, ""Following antibiotic treatment, symptoms resolved in most patients, with only a few reporting mild symptoms attributable to LD at 6 months or at 1 year post-treatment"". This contrasts with broader literature suggesting that 10-20% of LD patients develop Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS) with persistent symptoms. It would be beneficial for the authors to discuss why their cohort experienced such a high recovery rate. Were specific exclusion criteria applied that might have inadvertently selected for individuals less prone to PTLDS (e.g., absence of certain co-morbid conditions known to be risk factors, that’s very interesting to speculate)? The methods section details exclusions such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, traumatic brain injury, prolonged undiagnosed somatic complaints, morbid obesity, sleep apnea, autoimmune disease, uncontrolled cardiopulmonary or endocrine disorders, recent malignancy, liver disease, major psychiatric illness, or substance abuse. While extensive, it's worth considering if these fully account for the low PTLDS rate. Additionally, the cohort demographics (Figure 1B) show a skew towards male patients (27 male vs. 22 female). Given that some infection-associated chronic illnesses, including potentially PTLDS, may skew female, could this gender distribution contribute to the observed recovery outcomes? Clarification on these points would help contextualize the study's findings regarding the typical immune trajectory of acute LD. Major Points: 1) Comparability of Meta-Analysis Cohorts: The conclusions regarding skin-derived systemic signals rely heavily on meta-analyses of public datasets (GSE63085, GSE154916, GSE169440). It is crucial to provide a more detailed comparison of the clinical characteristics (symptoms, treatment, PTLDS rates) of these external cohorts with the primary study cohort. For instance, the GSE63085 PBMC dataset is from a cohort with a reported PTLDS-like symptom rate of ~46%, substantially different from the near-complete recovery in the current study's cohort. These differences should be explicitly discussed as they could influence the nature and interpretation of immune responses. I wonder if the major differences seen in the skin vs PBMCs here are driven more by immune differences in people who are on a trajectory to recover vs those who are not. There are public datasets available on PBMCs as well, such as from the SLICE cohort including those on a trajectory to recover and those who are not. These should be compared in the analysis. 2) The finding of largely quiescent PBMCs in the face of infection and systemic mediator changes is surprising. The authors should expand their discussion to contextualize this observation against other types of infections, or Borrelia infections where people go on to develop borrelia infection-associated chronic illness. For example, how does this compare to PBMC responses in other chronic infections, tissue-localized (versus systemic/blood-borne) infections, or infections caused by slow-growing (like B. burgdorferi) versus fast-growing bacteria? Or, back to point #1, is this more just what PBMCs look like in someone who has been successfully treated with an antibiotic for a bacterial infection, and is this just what being on track to a full recovery looks like? That would explain why this looks so different from PBMC profiles in chronic illnesses like TB/HIV/HCV/ T. cruzi, but would make more sense in the context of a cleared infection and recovery. One additional thing to consider is that most of the immune granulocyte cells will be spun out of the PBMC fraction, but that does not mean those responses aren't circulating in the blood, they just won't be found in the PBMCs. 3) The T3 timepoint seems to stand out compared to T2 or T4, and it’s not clear why, and this isn’t adequately addressed in the discussion or limitations. Minor Points (Organized by Figure): Figure 1: Study overview and clinical manifestations Panel B: The gender distribution is skewed male. It would be useful to know if any sex-based differences in the measured parameters were analyzed, as this was not apparent throughout the manuscript. Panel C: The T3 (6 months) timepoint for C6 ELISA is missing; only T1, T2, and T4 are shown. Is that because T3 looks weird throughout, and you didn’t want to show it? Panel F: It would be helpful to indicate which correlations are statistically significant (e.g., using asterisks or by highlighting significant bubbles). Figure 2: Differential expression of circulating proteins and their correlation with symptoms Panel A: The separation into fast- and slow-resolving clusters is a very interesting and insightful presentation. However, the text states PRDX5 remained significantly elevated at T2, but this is not immediately clear from the heatmap's visual representation for PRDX5 in the T1-T2 comparison. Only IL17C is labeled as significant (T2-T3) in the slow responding genes. Panel B: It is unclear why not all rows are labeled as they appear in A across all pathway comparisons, which makes it harder to assess the full dynamics. Maybe this circles back to the fact that some of them were significant T1-T2, and not T1-3, but then again yes T1-4 so maybe it looked messy to show it that way? But this way you only show the first set it was significant for, and not the dynamics in between… Panel C and D: The rationale for selecting T1 versus T3 for this heatmap of cardiovascular, metabolism, and organ damage proteins could be clarified, especially as Panel A focuses on pairwise comparisons across all timepoints. And at other times T3 seems to be intentionally excluded. Displaying patient-based trends rather than just row-based averages might also be informative. The asterisks on the left indicating significance are somewhat hard to read on the opposite side from the label. Panel E: This is a visually appealing figure, though the bundling can make specific correlations slightly challenging to trace. Figure 3: Integrated community analysis and diagnostic modeling Panel A: Could the authors add descriptions of any shared features or overarching themes among the analytes within each of the three largest communities beyond endothelial disruption/protection? The rho scale for symptom correlations (-0.4 to 0.6) suggests many correlations are not very strong; indicating that adding statistical significance for these symptom correlations would be beneficial. Panel B, C, D: These ROC curves are interesting for diagnostic potential. Suggestion: If data are available, showing a baseline ROC curve using standard clinical diagnostic features (e.g., EM presence, basic serology if used for initial classification rather than just inclusion) could provide a useful comparison for the multiomic models. Figure 5: Minimal peripheral changes in acute LD Panel A: The highest variance explained by PC1 in the PCA of PBMC abundances is relatively low (18.4% for patients, 16.2% for controls), suggesting considerable heterogeneity not captured by the main principal components. Panel B: The decrease in plasmablasts over time would possibly be expected if it aligned with the development of memory B cells. But that doesn’t seem to be the case from this data. That might be a fit with what Nicole Baumgarth has described in B6 mice, and definitely warrants further discussion. Panel C: The UMAP visualization shows minimal separation. Without non-recovered patients, it's difficult to discern disease-specific trends versus inter-individual variability. Figure 6: Dramatic changes in a case with severe disseminated disease The boxplots effectively highlight how different the severe outlier patient is. This case underscores the point that systemic activation can occur. I really wonder if compared to publicly available data from people who did and did not recover after their acute infection, if you would see a lot more of this. Replicating this in a dataset with more patients with severe, non-recovering disease would be necessary to draw broader conclusions about this hyperinflammatory state. Figure 7: Skin immune responses reflect plasma protein and metabolic signatures Panel A: the source/location of ""unaffected skin"" biopsies can influence cellular profiles. This should be addressed. Panel C: The differential expression of CXCL8 (IL-8) across various skin-resident cell types is very interesting as is LILRB4 expression in skin-resident cells which would support the tissue-based regulation hypothesis as long as we had more comparators between the symptoms and inflammatory state of the individuals these cohorts. I think this paper is both very informative, and very important. However, it does need to be contextualized as a deep study of a recovering cohort, perhaps being compared to cohorts with more people who are not recovering, and that needs to be accounted for.",2025-10-08T14:25:37,michal_tal,Michal Tal,,,,

The authors show that product inhibition, which might seem to slow things down, actually helps populations maintain diversity and obtain new adaptations FASTER. Without hybridization, the fittest sequences rapidly outcompete all others, driving the population into a low-diversity state centered on a local fitness peak. This SLOWS adaptation, because new mutations can arise only from a narrow set of closely related sequences. With hybridization, all sequences partially inhibit each other, preventing any single clone from sweeping the population. This maintains a broad pool of genetic diversity for longer periods, effectively flattening the adaptive landscape and accelerating the discovery of fitter variants. Hybridization transforms individual fitness from a fixed property into a population-dependent quantity: the reproductive success of a sequence depends on the presence and abundance of other sequences. This introduces frequency-dependent selection, reshaping the evolutionary dynamics without altering mutation rates or external conditions. In classical models, large networks of nearly neutral genotypes allow populations to drift across genotype space. Product inhibition breaks this neutrality by making fitness context dependent. Sequences that were previously neutral can become advantageous or deleterious depending on the surrounding population, creating a constantly shifting fitness landscape.",2025-10-07T13:37:08,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

Here are our highlights: Conventional assays have a lot of noise, making it hard to pick out subtle genetic influences. This method increases the signal-to-noise ratio, lowering the barrier to detecting genetic effects in vitro. Future studies could use the Townlet method to evaluate how rare mutations shape cellular phenotypes. Typical GWAS studies require hundreds to thousands of participants to account for confounders and small effect sizes. The GWAS-in-a-dish method used here measures each donor's proliferation/survival repeatedly over time, which removes confounders, clarifies the genetic signal, and drastically cuts the required number of participants to draw the same conclusions as a much more difficult study design. We appreciate Townlet's ability to identify differences in proliferation and viability through large-effect mutation, normal genetic variation, and treatment-dependent states. The village method shows promise for broad application, especially when used with an analytical tool that properly adapts to the unique constraints of compositional data.",2025-10-07T13:14:52,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

They highlight a synergistic role of ribosomal methyltransferases in restoring protein synthesis after translational arrest.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.16.633470v1#comment-6778011305,biorxivstage,0,"The authors claim that fitting a DDPM to a single MD dataset and subsequently generating samples from the trained  model results in ‘enhanced sampling’. This claim is highly dubious as the results seem to indicate that the ‘enhanced sampling’ they refer to is equivalent to adding small amounts of guassian noise to samples already present in the MD training data. In fact, this result is expected - when generating samples from a DDPM, a simple prior distribution is iteratively transformed to a sample from the data distribution through noisey purturbations in the direction of maximum likelihood. Consequently, it comes as no surprise that generated samples are highly similar but not exactly identical to samples from the training data. Upon additional training of a DDPM on a single dataset, one expects that these deviations should asymtotically decrease until the DDPM ‘memorizes’ the training data and generate nearly exact copies of the training data. In the context of MD, adding gaussian noise to pre-existing samples from long-time MD is generally not considered a useful enhanced sampling method, unless noise perturbed structures are subsequently evaluated with a potential energy function and are subject to some aceptance criteria, as is done in metropolis hasting / MCMC sampling methods. I do not belive that the ‘enhanced sampling’ the authors claim to obtain from over-fitting DDPMs on single MD datasets is of the same nature as that expected from standard enhaced sampling methods for MD like replica exchange or metadynamics, which aim to explore completely new regions of phase space that are otherwise difficult to access and not yet characterized. The authors present no evidence that their procedure is able to generate samples that are substantially different than those already present in the MD training data - therefore, I would not consider this an enhanced sampling method in any sense. Moreover, the DDPMs presented here are trained to maximize the likelihood of generating samples that are similar to the training data distribution - there is no incentive for the model to explore new regions of phase space and one could argue that if their model were producing samples highly dissimilar to the traing data - it would suggest that the model is either under-fit or systematically incapable of appropriately modeling the training data.",2025-10-04T19:58:19,,annonymous,,,,

I found this research paper to be interesting because a lot of previous research before has not discussed how DNA from terrestrial animals can be found in the air and this information could help with biomonitoring similar to how eDNA is utilized in aquatic settings. I understand that this type of research has never been done before and it demonstrated how this technology can detect species in zoos and demonstrates how it can serve to be useful in the biodiversity field. I do wonder since there are high levels of contamination within these air samples how reliable could the samples be? I also understand that the method of sampling each information costs a lot and I wonder how this could be accessible to various laboratories dedicated to protecting biodiversity? I’m curious to know if you were able to develop further tools to mitigate the effects of contamination within the data samples collected. I thought it was incredible that in a zoo setting the  biodiversity monitoring was able to identify specific species and the location of those species. Another question I have with this information is if you have given thought if the information could have been different if the tool was placed in a wild life setting instead of a controlled environment such as the zoo? Overall, I think this paper and the research done with various methods will help with further research as to how DNA from the air can be utilized to revolutionize biodiversity further in the future.

The most critical issue is the use of HEK293T embryonic kidney cells as a “normal control” for gallbladder cancer, which is biologically inappropriate and invalidates much of the comparative analysis. The reported patient validation is based on only 3–5 samples, which is statistically underpowered and cannot support strong conclusions. The claims of discovering “novel miRNAs” are based solely on in silico prediction, with no experimental validation. The central mechanistic assertion — that miR-17~92 directly targets Cdt2 — is not demonstrated with luciferase reporter assays, which are a gold-standard requirement in miRNA research. Moreover, the paper overstates therapeutic implications without any in vivo data, making such claims premature and misleading. Overall, this work reads as a descriptive sequencing dataset inflated with overstated conclusions.
