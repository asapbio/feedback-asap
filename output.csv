I suggest that it may be that the ecological need for managing length of life is universal, but that it is implemented differently in different species. Salmon destroy their bodies with glucocorticoids; elephants fail to grow a 7th set of teeth and can't chew their food; mice get cancer; rats get heart disease -- but the underlying adaptive motivations might be universal. The best evidence for this is the role of insulin signaling, which accelerates aging across the animal kingdom.",2024-10-31T15:54:51,joshmitteldorf,Josh Mitteldorf,10.1101/2024.10.28.620557,"Cross-Species Analysis Reveals No Universal Programmed Aging Mechanism: Insights from Single-Cell Transcriptomics in Zebrafish, Fruit Fly, and Nematode","Yuhui Niu, Dongzhi Wu, Sen Zhang, Hong Zheng, Xing Wu, Jiansong Chen, Yuhui Niu, Tao Zhang, Wenhui He, Li Chen",2024-10-29

For instance, the embryo injected with CRISPRi + tyr sgRNAs marked with 48 hpf in Figure 1B, appears to be developmentally equivalent to a 30 hpf wild-type embryo, which exhibits substantially fewer pigment cells than embryos at 48 hpf. This discrepancy raises concerns about the direct impact of the CRISPRi/a + sgRNAs injection, whether or not the delay development was caused by an unintended consequence. I strongly recommend that the authors reexamine their results and conduct a comparative analysis of CRISPRi/a + sgRNAs-injected and control embryos at equivalent conventional developmental stages, as described by Kimmel et al (1995, PMID: 8589427).

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.23.604321v1#comment-6581542824,biorxivstage,1,"Dear authors, as part of a group activity in our lab we discussed your very interesting paper with the goal to review it. The below review is the result of this exercise and therefor reflects the thoughts and concerns of several people. We hope this helps you with your way forward to publish the paper in a good journal. Review: The manuscript by De Tito et al. reports a hitherto unknown role for ATG9 in recruitment of PI4K2A to damaged lysosomes to control the levels of PI(4)P, lysosomal membrane contact site formation with the ER, and lipid transfer from ER to damaged lysosomes. They report that this mechanism is controlled by ARFIP2, which shuttles between the Golgi where it anchors ATG9 and lysosomes, and by the AP-3 complex, which mediates retrieval of ATG9 from lysosomes. Finally, the authors show a role for their proposed mechanism in lysosome damage induced by Salmonella infection. The manuscript deals with the timely topic of lysosomal damage repair and PI4K2A was recently emerging as a key player in this process. Mechanisms for PI4K2A recruitment to the sites of damaged lysosomes were so far elusive. Although the manuscript is certainly of interest for the field, the presented evidence on which the claims and the proposed model are based on seem not always substantial enough and further work is required. Major concerns •	Novelty and generalization: Although the findings suggest new functions for ATG9A and ARFIP2, they overlap significantly with previous work on autophagic and lysosomal repair pathways. The novelty of these findings, in comparison to earlier research, could be emphasized more clearly. •	The claim that ARFIP2 ""modulates lipid transfer for lysosomal repair"" could benefit from additional direct evidence linking lipid transfer to lysosomal recovery and ARFIP2's specific role in this process. There is only one in vitro experiment directly showing lipid transfer modulation by ARFIP2 (Fig. 5K). The authors should use the ARFIP2 W99A mutant in this experiment to test whether lipid transfer modulation is specific and according to their model. •	A central claim of the manuscript is a role for ARFIP2 in the repair of damaged lysosomes. The gold standard assay in the field is recovery of lysotracker fluorescence after LLOME-induced damage as shown in Fig. 2G. The way the experiment is presented does not instill confidence. The effects are relatively modest, it is unclear how the statistics were done, the representative images in the supplement only remotely resemble lysotracker stainings, how a reliable lysosome number from these images could be extracted is unclear, it is not shown whether and how much the cells express GFP-ARFIP2, the time points of the images do not match the relevant time points in the quantification, and the lysosome number in the different samples before LLOME treatment is not factored in. •	The major lysosome repair assay in the manuscript is Galectin staining. This is a rather indirect assay as compared to the lysotracker recovery assay as it shows the damage rather than the repair. Could there be repaired lysosomes that still are positive for Galectin? Is the total Galectin expression level the same in the cell lines and conditions used?  Furthermore, spot quantification for lysosomal damage markers like LGALS3 (Figure 2f) does not account for cell size or density, potentially leading to misinterpretation of the data. The authors further need to show lysotracker recovery in ATG9 loss of function to substantiate their claims. •	The authors show that ARFIP2 and ATG9 affect PI4K2A localization in cells. The “delivery” of PI4K2A to lysosomes, however, which is a central claim in this manuscript, is insufficiently demonstrated. Same is true for the “retrieval” of ATG9: The authors claim that AP-3 and ARFIP2 are important for the retrieval of ATG9A vesicles. Even though they show effects of these proteins on ATG9A presence at the lysosomes, they never manage to show that retrieval really is impaired. I am not fully sure if it is possible to make videos that convincingly show this. Either they should try that, or they should not hammer so hard on the word retrieval when they never show it specifically. •	The dynamic interactions of the relevant components need to be better demonstrated and characterized. E.g. interactions ATG9-PI4K2A interaction needs to be proven and characterized better (e.g. by co-IP, immunogold or similar techniques). Otherwise the role of ATG9 is much secondary, and should be a ARFIP2-mainly focused paper. The experiments in figure 4H and 4G seem ideally suited for this purpose but the authors fail to show the relevant components in the same blot. •	The increased formation of membrane contact sites is insufficiently demonstrated. The authors need to use electron microscopy, super resolution microscopy, SPLICS or other appropriate techniques to make this claim •	The way of quantifying protein localization to lysosomes (intensity lysosomes/total) seems heavily dependent on the lysosome coverage of the cells. In conditions where to my impression the overall number of lysosomes also changes, I would like to see a negative control that demonstrates that the enhanced lysosome localization is not just by chance, since there are more lysosomes. This applies for instance to Figure 4E+F and 5A+B. •	I am not satisfied with the data analysis they presented. The authors should indicate the statistical test for each piece of data they analysed including an explanation, why did they chose particular test. For instance, in fig. 2g they compare the amount of puncta or lysosomes (it is not clear as well) in the cell in a pairwise manner. It would be more appropriate to implement a statistical test that can compare the curves fitted with the data points or a test which can compare each time point individually, i.e. Kaplan-Meier plot. Minor comments •	The zooms generally miss scalebars •	Which part of the picture the zoom is from is often not indicated •	Many of the images are hard to interpret because of low contrast, I would recommend to put their individual channels in grey •	Fig3f. requires a better representative image and although there is a line indicated there is no line plot •	Fig. 1c: show quantification for pS6K •	Fig. 2b: data points are the same as figure 1b •	Fig. 3: Live-imaging of ATG9A with AP-3D1 is needed",2024-10-30T14:15:51,disqus_USVOnz2Dvr,Anonymous,10.1101/2024.07.23.604321,ATG9A and ARFIP2 cooperate to regulate PI4P levels for lysosomal repair,"Stefano De Tito, Eugenia Almacellas, Daniel Dai Yu, Wenxin Zhang, Emily Millard, Javier H.

The cited patents claim “a particularly long duration of action”, which suggests LM189 may be even more extreme than salmeterol, but don't appear to give any results.

This study provides a model that mimics the body environment, so you can expect more accurate results in a similar setting without reaching the in vivo level. It is also interesting that this model replicates the conditions during muscle regeneration and that H4K16ac, which is related to muscle regeneration, is regulated depending on stiffness, thereby influencing muscle regeneration. I have a few questions regarding your study: 1. How could these findings help in clinical practice? Are there cases where high tissue stiffness makes regeneration difficult for patients? 2. Is the increased stiffness after tissue injury mainly due to fibrosis or increased ECM production? 3. If that is the case, have you studied whether muscle regeneration can be supported by giving drugs that inhibit fibrosis or ECM production to injured muscle tissue? Some of these drugs, like SB431542, metformin, and pirfenidone, have already been reported to promote muscle regeneration. 4. The study mentions that these findings could help with muscle regeneration treatment. As there are already many methods known to support muscle regeneration, what unique contribution does this study make to help with muscle regeneration?

Your analysis of plasmid copy number across diverse bacterial genera is impressive and the discovery of a scaling law linking plasmid size and PCN is a huge contribution to the understanding of plasmid biology. I was wondering, based on your discussion on the intrinsic variability of PCN in high-copy number plasmids versus low-copy number plasmids, how these variations impact the fitness of bacterial populations, especially under different selective pressures.

I think the paper is written in a way that people will understand the differences between BL and TL and agree that there are so many advantages to the BL. I think your strongest part is how you explain your data from the figures since you talk about the how and identify how to understand the figures and tables. I would say for figure one; I was wondering if maybe also using bar graphs since it shows a clearer way of differentiation like Figure 2. I also think instead of tables, more figures will help the public understand their pros and cons better visually. I also think that the sludge's low read count should be addressed more. While it is mentioned that the Flongle's limitations might have affected the detection of less abundant entities, why do you think happened to that sample, and how could you express that to the audience? I think you could strengthen their argument by referencing specific species, ARGs, or plasmid types they suspect might have been missed due to the lower read count. To end this, I think the authors did a great job explaining the differences, and my only concerns were adding figures and explaining the sludge sample.",2024-10-23T00:19:08,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2024.10.05.616767,Portable In-Field DNA Sequencing for Rapid Detection of Pathogens and Antimicrobial Resistance: A Proof-of-Concept Study,"Stephanie Pillay, David Calderón-Franco, Thomas Abeel",2024-10-06

It was very well-written, and the methodology very clearly described and reproducible. Given the global clinical significance of malaria, the biological implications of this study can be used as a basis for further studies into the biology of circadian rhythms in malaria transmission, as well as clinical translation for efficient prevention and control strategies and more effective treatments. Similar to what previous reviewers have noted, I noticed some inconsistencies between some of the figures and the apparently corresponding results in the text, especially as it relates to the percentages of the transcriptome displaying cyclic expression profiles, for both the mosquito salivary glands and sporozoites. The figures and/or results should therefore be corrected accordingly. A possible limitation to the study, which I don't believe was addressed in the paper, was that different mosquito (Anopheles stephensi vs Anopheles gambiae) and parasite (Plasmodium berghei versus Plasmodium falciparum, vivax, ovale, malariae, or knowlesi) species from the ones which are primarily known to cause malaria in humans, were used for analysis in this study. This may limit direct clinical translation of these results for malaria in humans. There should be a statement addressing this in the discussion. Furthermore, the amount of gene homology between the species used in the study and the species causing disease in humans should be stated for reference.

The use of RNA-sequencing to uncover rhythmic gene expression in mosquito salivary glands is a significant strength and offers important new insights into the mechanisms behind malaria transmission. The figures are clear and effectively illustrate how these rhythms correlate with mosquito feeding efficiency and parasite infection capabilities, though the figure legends could benefit from more detailed explanations, especially for readers unfamiliar with gene expression data. The introduction is solid but could be improved by providing a more detailed discussion of previous research on circadian rhythms in malaria parasites to better frame the novelty of this study. The discussion section does a good job connecting the findings to broader vector-borne diseases like Zika and dengue, but it would be even stronger with specific examples of how these results could inform practical malaria control strategies, such as optimizing the timing of interventions based on mosquito feeding times.

Malaria remains a major global health challenge, and understanding the biological rhythms of mosquito vectors and malarial parasites is crucial for improving control strategies. However, previous studies have only revealed that mosquitoes have daily rhythmic behaviors. You provided new insights. First, about half of the genes in the mosquito salivary gland transcriptome show 24-hour rhythmic expression, and second, the gene expression of sporozoites in the salivary glands also shows circadian rhythms (parasite movement and infection ability). In addition, you mentioned in the discussion that the parasites and mosquitoes have evolved in coordination with the circadian rhythms, and jointly affect host infection by regulating parasite movement and mosquito blood feeding time. This is very interesting, and your findings provide a new perspective for understanding the temporal regulation mechanism of malaria transmission. At the same time, you mentioned optimizing the insecticide spraying time strategy according to the peak period of mosquito activity. In addition, your findings may also have reference effects on other diseases. But I have some questions. First, it is good that you use 12h dark and 12h light to simulate day and night. But in the wild, the temperature and humidity vary between day and night. Perhaps the natural day-night cycle could be better simulated by changing temperature and humidity. Secondly, you mentioned that some observations may apply to uninfected mosquitoes, but you did not specifically discuss the potential differences in rhythms and behaviors between uninfected and infected mosquitoes.

As one of the researchers with the most publications on CAV1 in Ewing Sarcoma (Oscar M. Tirado), I would like to offer some comments and suggestions for your consideration: It might be beneficial to mention that CAV1 is a demonstrated direct target of EWS::FLI1, as this could add further context to your findings. Regarding the presence of caveolae in Ewing Sarcoma cells, I assume you've reviewed the manuscript (DOI: 10.1016/j.canlet.2016.11.020). In most of the cells studied, including TC71, the levels of Cavin-1, as well as caveolae, are extremely low. As such, the majority of CAV1’s functions in EwS are likely independent of caveolae, which aligns with the results you’ve presented. I noticed the focus on the AKT pathway in your work. Have you considered discussing the MAPK pathway as well? It is also affected and likely plays a significant role in the processes you're describing. In Figure 4, CAV1 emerges as a potential driver, along with EphA2. I’m sure you are familiar with this study as well (DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31405), which may provide further insights.

They first applied their approach to the group II intron ribozyme from Thermosynechococcus elongatus, one of a few cryo-EM structures available in the PDB that featured mostly RNA and was obtained using a single-structure refinement procedure. They confirmed that remodeling with their approach mostly affected flexible regions at the solvent-exposed stem loops that were not phylogenetically conserved. They found that functional domains that were well-ordered, phylogenetically conserved, and were clearly represented by the cryo-EM density required no remodeling. Extending this analysis through other PDB structures revealed that poor modeling at flexible helical regions was broadly applicable to all RNA-containing cryo-EM-derived structures in the 2.5 - 4 Å resolution range. Major Points: It is difficult to keep track of the different parameters applied for each simulation. These are scattered in the text. It would be very helpful for the reader to understand these if the authors could make a table of all the MD simulations with specifications on helices restrained, approach, simulation time, force fields present, equilibration time etc. Clarification regarding the helical restraints and the simulation time for the initial production run would be helpful—i.e. Why was a simulation time of 2.5 ns chosen, and would this be long enough for your purposes considering the relatively high complexity of the system? Were restraints applied to the 3 helices (b,d,i) that unfolded in subsequent simulations or were they only applied to the other 6 helices? In the section “Base Pairing Analysis of the Protein Data Bank,” it is mentioned that the analysis likely over-estimates the problematic modeling of helices in cryo-EM derived RNA structures. Given that 15 Å is larger than the expected 8-11 Å (Pietal, M. J., 2012) distance for N1/N9 distance, would this not underestimate the number of problematic helices? A detailed analysis of H-bonding within the 6 helices would be useful to get a mechanistic understanding of why the 3 helices (b,d,i) unfold and the other 6 don't—for example, it might be helpful to provide a comparison with the model generated from a single structure approach to know if the same H-bonds exist in it or not as the model forwarded by this paper. ERMSD approach: we know relatively less about non-Watson Crick base pairing apart from Hoogsteen and G-U wobble base pairs since so much depends on the context (specific region of the structure, ion concentration, pH etc.) (we’re still thinking about how to phrase this point). Balance between experimental measurements and MD sampled conformational states: lack of experimental validation when remodeling mismodeled regions for RNA - how do we know when specific interactions are too ideal? How is variability between forcefield parameters for divalent metal ions or other ions addressed, especially considering that these are required for proper folding of RNA? Dispersive interactions play a huge role in RNA integrity: how confident can we be about these parameters when comparing various nucleic acid specific force fields? Can these differences lead to unfolding of the 3 properly base paired helices? With reference to the line on page 4: “The trajectories obtained with metainference simulations were then analyzed by back-calculating the corresponding averaged density map and comparing it to the experimental one”, was the solvent density included in the back-calculated density? What proportion of the CC_mask arises just due to fitting of rigid part of the structure and how much of it arises due to the improved fitting of the flexible regions from the 9 loops? Would it be possible to separate these contributions? Minor Points: Would it be possible to show Fig 2C as a violin or box plot rather than a bar plot? This would allow visualization of the distribution of CC_mask for different conditions with clusters representing conformational states that may agree with the experimental data. Is local resolution considered while plotting the RMSF? For this purpose, it would be useful to have a local resolution estimation for the map to help the reader understand whether the unfolding of helices occurs simply because the specific regions were not well defined or if these regions are inherently flexible. How effective is DeepFoldRNA in filling gaps in structure as it is normally known for sequence based structure prediction—specifically regarding the modeling of the 38-nucleotide gap? For benchmarking purposes, applying this approach to other RNA structures or providing additional validation against independent experimental data (e.g., SAXS or chemical shifts from short RNA motifs) could further strengthen the conclusions. Aside from the pre-1r (6ME0) and pre-2r (6MEC) states, Haack et al. (2019) found additional 3D classes that indicated disordered density in conserved regions, which they did not investigate further. They also suggested that the post-2r complex may be captured in one of the 3D classes that yielded a low-resolution 3D reconstruction. Is it possible that one of the structures found by the metainference method could have sampled one of the structures that were not investigated further or the post-2r complex? Why is there a sudden fall in the number of helices formed in 32 replicas (Fig 2E)? Sentence on page 4: “As a result, 32 replicas appeared to be the best compromise between agreement with experiment and computational cost.” Has it been ensured that this is not a result of overfitting? One of the ways to do this can be to use half-map cross validation i.e. to check if the refined ensemble fits both the half maps equally.

Some questions/comments: 1. to which extent this is specific to functional connectivity and not to EEG activity? Like, is EEG activity more, or less, ""driven by"" 1/f activity than FC? To which extent are the results here different from the evidence that if you filter a signal in a specific band you get some nonzero number even if you don't have a pure oscillation at that frequency throughout the duration of the signal? 1bis. If you would like to look at the differences (or lack thereof) between 1/f of a single variable and 1/f of FC between two variables, you could compute FC as cross spectral density and relate the 1/f of the cross spectrum with the 1/f of the two time series. Spoiler: the relation is quite unsurprising, figure here, from the internship work of Thibault Marichal, Ghent University  Btw in the left panel you can see that 1/f changes linearly with time as anesthesia kicks in. What this is due to? Creation of aperiodic activity coming from where? From nonstationary (some waxing some waning) oscillations (see points below)? From somewhere else? Who knows. https://imgur.com/tYyAqCN. 2. computing FC in 4 seconds long windows assumes that the series (and the oscillations in this case) are stationary across the whole duration, like you have sustained alpha, theta, gamma, beta, delta for 4 seconds. Actually for the whole duration of the recording. Why epoching in 4 seconds then? The thing is that even if you have nothing else than perfectly nice and sinusoidal oscillations, but their amplitude fluctuates in time, a 1/f part of the spectrum is generated. See this figure, again courtesy of Thibault Marichal https://imgur.com/y7WJCam. This is unavoidable, but it does not mean that there are no oscillations, simply that our stationarity assumptions are not met. And that's why I think that the activity should be called 1/f but not ""aperiodic"", at least when we re conflating spatiotemporal (neuronal) scales as we do in EEG. 2bis. The spectrum is a whole, separating it in oscillatory bands and ""aperiodic"" or 1/f is as artificial as separating it in bands. But the bands are at least associated to some behavior and to some neuronal activity. 1/f is a bag of everything else, including oscillations (perhaps not when you consider spikes, there 1/f is more specific, but this is not the case here). To this extent, is not surprising that 1/f accounts for a lot of stuff. 3. What does the percentage mean, when in the abstract you write that X% of {alpha, beta, etc.} networks are driven by 1/f? I read it as ""we have 100 alpha networks, of which 23 to 55 are driven by 1/f"". Now, apart from what ""driving a network"" means, it's not clear what these networks are. From the text, I think you refer to connections being retained. In this case you should refer to connections, and specify that this is an average at the group level. 4. what's the rationale of extracting ""networks"" from full correlation matrices? What does ""efficency"", or ""shortest path"", or ""centrality"" means when computed on a thresholded correlation matrix? The fact that these quantities can be defined does not mean that they are meaningful. And if they do correlate with something interesting, is most likely because they are connected to (local) spectral features, see https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809419303416 and https://pubpeer.com/publications/0732054EAAF1E3BC7C8248A8296CFC 5. What is the justification to the fact that the 95% of connections that you threshold away are ""spurious""? Just based on the value? This seems off. And this artificial sparsification of the matrix conflate the thresholding issue with the oscillatory vs 1/f issue. 6. speaking of ""conflating"", you write of oscillations ""conflated by aperiodic activity"". Do you mean ""inflated by"" or ""conflated with""? 7. There's a sentence on covariance matrix computed in the pre-stimulus part, but it's not clear how this is used, and why a stimulus is relevant here. Maybe just a leftover from a study investigating some stimulus activity. Thanks for listening!

Thank you for your contribution and dedication to the field. As I read through your paper, I have a few comments I would like to offer. Fig1: While I was intrigued by the several stainings and experiments carried out by your team, it would be helpful to understand your rationale for choosing the gestational ages of interest. Additionally, since this is a comparative review, it would be useful to visualize the corresponding gestational ages in mice. I also noticed you cited these phases in mice, but it would be much more memorable if there was a clear schematic comparing the two species' gestational ages to go along with the rest of the figure as well. Fig2: I noticed a one-way ANOVA was carried out for several of the corresponding data. However, ANOVA's are designed to compare means of groups with samples >3. In the supplemental figures, several groups were either missing data, or had samples <3. Asterisks marking significance would also be useful to visualize significance on the graphs. Fig3&4: Quantification of fluorescence would be useful to make statistical comparisons. As is, the evidence is too correlative to make any conclusions. Fig5: For clarity, place comparative groups in alphabetical order (ex: 5a and 5c should be 5a and 5b). Additionally, 5k-q show dim fluorescence, and should be quantified to make accurate  statistical comparisons. 5f should be compared via a multivariate-ANOVA. Final remarks: Further manipulative, molecular experiments are required to make conclusions on similarity. A stronger argument could be made if additional evidence were included. Additionally, sex and cultural differences likely will cause variation among your data. Stating the sex of the samples can help make more accurate comparisons between data. Comparative experiments between sexes and across ethnicities in humans may also be useful.",2024-10-15T20:51:50,,Alexa Jennings,10.1101/2024.07.26.605346,Characterisation of human hair follicle development,"Zoe R.

B., Kurteff, G. L., & Chang, E. F. (2023). Inhibitory control of speech production in the human premotor frontal cortex. bioRxiv, 2023-03. This manuscript by Zhao and colleagues examined the role of the human premotor frontal cortex in speech inhibition. The results provide us with important conceptual advances as previous research studies in inhibitory control have been centered on simple motor control such as eye and hand movements (Aron et al., 2014; Schall et al., 2002).  However, we have several conceptual and methodological suggestions for improving the manuscript. Major 1. Statistics The authors reported t-values for each electrode locations, and thresholded the values so they could choose electrodes based on the categories they specified (Figures 1 and 2). However, without knowing the degree of freedom, it is hard to tell whether the activity showed statistically significant modulations based on stopping and production. Further, the distribution of the three (green/orange/purple) populations in Figure 1 and the ES/NF/Both in Figure 2 could change based on how they threshold t-values. It would be useful to get more information regarding how statistical threshold were chosen for these t-values. 2. Beta activity in NF The authors showed HGA separately for Stop+/Prod- and Stop+/Prod+, but did not separate the two groups in showing beta activity in Figure 2G. The scatter plot in Figure 2H indicates that the t-val is higher for NF than that for ES. Although the authors conclude “beta-band activity is not specifically related to early stopping” (page 6 line 8), we wonder if there is a general trend of beta activity showing higher correlation with natural finish. An analysis showing the proportion of ES and NF in beta activity might support that beta activity codes NF while HGA codes ES. In addition, a supplemental figure showing Stop+/Prod- and Stop+/Prod+ in beta band could help readers have a better understanding of beta band activity across these two populations. 3. Latency in “Cue” and “Action” related activity and other connectivity measures The authors showed that “Cue” electrodes have earlier latency than “Action” electrodes, and that “Action” electrodes have correlation with Stop RT while “Cue” electrodes do not (Figure 3). The authors’ interpretation of these results was that “The difference in peak time of stop activity suggests that neural signals may track different events relevant to the stopping behavior in their temporal order. The cue related activity may be involved in identifying the need to stop speaking, which constitutes an early stage. In contrast, later stage action related activity may be involved in forming the stop command and controlling the execution of speech stopping.” (page 7 line 11-15). However, to further support their interpretation, the authors need to show more information about how cue-related activity influences stop-related activity. Connectivity measures between the two populations using Granger causality (as the authors did in Figure 5E) or a different connectivity measure would provide more convincing evidence for their interpretation. 4. Stopping activity in “Midword” and “End-of-word” The authors showed that stopping activity is higher in “Midword” than “End-of-word” (page 7 line 24-26; Figure 4). Are these “Midword” trials all trials when the speech stopped within a word? The authors provided “Fri” as “Midword” example and “Friday” as “End-of-word” example. Is their modulation based on where the subject stops? (e.g. Is there a difference when you stop at “Fr” or “Frid”) Whether there is a modulation based on specific stopping point could provide a stronger support for this modulation based on abrupt vs. complete ending in stopping activity. 5. Granger causality results and additional connectivity metrics The authors provided evidence on connectivity based on “Granger causality.” They mentioned that these are from “raw neural signals” (page 9 line 2). We are assuming this is based on LFP-LFP relationship between two electrodes. However, it is not clear at which frequency they looked at for the Granger causality. Please specify whether LFP signals and frequency range were used in Figure 5E. Further, Granger causality is often susceptible to noise and one connectivity analysis alone is usually not sufficient to support the interpretation regarding connectivity between brain regions (Bastos & Schoffelen, 2016; Strahnen et al., 2021). An additional connectivity metric such as coherence or pair-wise phase consistency between spikes and LFP signals would better support the interpretation. 6. Speech/hand specificity The authors suggested specificity based on motor modalities (page 10; line 12-14). There are separations of the populations for “Speech only” and “Hand only” in Dorsal and Ventral (Figure 6B). In Figure 6A, it seems like that green dots are located more posterior. An additional figure showing separation based on a different dimension (e.g., anterior-posterior axis) could help readers have a better picture of the populations in a different dimension. Recent neuroimaging studies suggested that there might be action-specificity rather than effector-specificity (Liu et al., 2020, 2022).  Whether these two groups of electrodes are intermingled or segregated in a different dimension could give us important insight into cortical organization of action and effectors. 7. Discussion for speech arrest vs. speech error The authors provided “tennmtwo” as an example of speech error (Figure 7A). More examples of speech errors could help readers better understand these errors. If another error was “twenn,” it could be a mixture of speech arrest/error for pronouncing “twentytwo”. A more detailed explanation about how the authors group or define speech arrest vs. speech error can be added to Methods. 8. Discussion about neural circuits for speech production and stopping based on neural modulation The fact that Stop+/Prod+ (purple) cells in Figure 1E show modulations to both production and stopping makes us wonder whether and how the neural circuits for speech production and stopping are same or different. One could imagine that these purple cells might have different connectivity to brain regions that contribute to speech articulation. In the Discussion section, it would be good to add an explanation or speculation about the similarity or differences in neural circuits for speech production and stopping based on the finding of these purple cells. 9. Adding Method details in the Results section The structure of the manuscript follows Introduction – Results – Discussion – Methods. Because methodological details are described at the end of the manuscript, it would be useful to add a few more details at the beginning of the Results section. For example, the information that participants were epilepsy patients is crucial (otherwise the info “left hemisphere or LH, right hemisphere or RH” is confusing). Further, to sufficiently understand the paradigm, it should be mentioned whether every trial required participants to stop and whether the delay was variable across trials. In addition to the range of finished trials, it would also be good to mention the average of included trials. Minor Figure 1C: The “blue” horizontal bars look like green. We would suggest changing the color to a stronger blue color. Page 4 lines 16: It is a bit unclear why “example” electrodes are described here. Representative electrodes can be used for graphical depiction (as in Figure 1C) but should not be used for statistical testing (unless these are the peak electrodes?). Also, a sentence on how stop/prod electrodes were classified would be helpful. Page 12 line 13: syntax (“in additional to” should be replaced with “in addition to”) References Aron, A.

By conducting a transcriptomic analysis of plants with varying levels of tolerance to Cd and Hg, the study identified tissue-specific, genotype-specific, and metal-specific gene expression patterns. Notably, plants inoculated with mercury-tolerant rhizobia strains carrying a mercury reductase (Mer) operon experienced less reduction in nodule number, plant biomass, and iron distribution under Hg stress. This suggests that Hg-tolerant rhizobia can mitigate Hg toxicity in plants, enhancing resilience in contaminated environments. These findings highlight the potential to optimize legume-rhizobia interactions for improving plant tolerance to heavy metals and reducing heavy metal transport to edible parts of the plant, which is critical for food safety.",2024-10-08T19:41:38,disqus_esZHcfuXVr,Reena Sharma,10.1101/2024.10.06.616885,Plant genotype and microbial strain combinations strongly influence the transcriptome under heavy metal stress conditions,"Reena Sharma, Sanhita Chakraborty, Aditi Bhat, Michael Clear, Meng Xie, José J.

I have concerns about the validity of the cryoEM result presented in this paper. The authors claim they obtained “a structure of the NINJ1 segment at 4.3 Å”. At this resolution, the following features should be clearly resolved in a cryoEM map of a protein containing alpha helices: •	The pitch of alpha helices (~5.5 Å) •	Large amino acid side residue side chains (e.g. Phe or Tyr, of which there are several in Ninj1) Neither of these features are demonstrated in the figures prepared by the authors. Figure panels S2D and E are consistent with a resolution of ~ 8-10 Å, where alpha helices are resolved as tubular features. No regular indentation or ridging corresponding to the helical pitch is apparent in the figures, or upon visual inspection of the deposited map ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/EMD-42301). No features corresponding to Phe or Tyr side chains are visible. At the resolution claimed by the authors, features corresponding to the side chains of residues Phe100, Phe117, Phe127 and Phe135, which are all located in alpha-helical segments (not in loops), would be expected to be resolved in the map, but they are not. In my view, based on this map inspection the authors should not have made this resolution claim. To support their resolution claim, the authors present Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curves from the cryoSPARC software in Figure S2C. While the FSC curve shown by the authors does cross the 0.143 threshold at ~4.3 Å, the FSC curve exhibits pathologies, which should have alerted the authors to the possibility that the 4.3 Å resolution estimate may be unreliable and that the map should be interpreted with caution. Most notably the curve starts dropping off at around 15 Å, indicating that the signal-to-noise ratio in the map is significantly deteriorated at resolution of ~15 Å and beyond. After completion of 3D refinement, cryoSPARC also outputs a second FSC figure, which includes an additional curve (“Corrected”), which accounts for effects of masking on resolution estimation by the FSC. It is unfortunate that the authors didn’t include this in their manuscript. The most likely explanation for this pathological FSC resolution estimate and its mismatch with the features resolved in the map is that the 3D refinement failed (due to high noise, or preferred orientation, or other pathologies in the dataset or in the refinement parameters), leading to overfitting to a local minimum in the scoring function. Indeed, the validation report for the deposited map and PDB (EMDB: 42301; PDB: 8UIP; https://files.rcsb.org/pub/pdb/validation_reports/ui/8uip/8uip_full_validation.pdf) contains evidence of overfitting during refinement. The orthogonal projections of the raw map (Section 6.1.2 of the validation report) show overfitting artefacts, as do the orthogonal standard deviation projections in false color of the raw map (Section 6.4.2). Such overfitting causes artifically inflated FSC values, which may help explain why the FSC-based estimate of resolution was wrong in this case. Given a map of this quality, it’s unclear how the authors built an atomic model of Ninj1. In that respect, the publication’s methods section is not detailed enough. Table S2 indicates that the authors started from a computational structure prediction from AlphaFold2. Given the lack of any features in the map to help place any residue side chains, I assume the location of key residues mentioned in the paper originated from this computational prediction rather than from the cryoEM result itself. The lack of support for the modeled atomic coordinates from cryoEM is also made evident in the EMDB/PDB validation report by the unusually poor Q and atom inclusion scores for a map/model of the claimed resolution. A Q-score of 0.04 is unusually low and shows very little map-to-model fit. These metrics, together with a visual inspection of the map and model as deposited, suggests that a significant fraction of the sequence was built outside the map and that the cryoEM result does not support the authors’ atomic model beyond the general shape and relative orientation of parts of the alpha-helical segments. The positioning of individual amino acid residues is not directly specified by the cryoEM result and may have come mostly from the AlphaFold model the authors used as a starting point. Note: the above observations should be not be taken as having any bearing on other key cryoEM-based observations in the paper, such as the curvatures of Ninj1 assemblies, which are supported by two-dimensional class averages of cryoEM images and not affected by overfitting in the later 3D refinement process.",2024-10-08T00:33:10,alexisrohou,Alexis Rohou,10.1101/2023.06.01.543231,NINJ1 mediates plasma membrane rupture through formation of nanodisc-like rings,"Liron David, Jazlyn P Borges, L.

In the Introduction, you note that one drawback of RFDiffusion/MPNN-based pipelines is the need to screen thousands to tens of thousands of designs in silico before finding the 10-100 that pass the quality metrics and can be tested experimentally with good success rates. Does BindCraft also require screening of thousands to tens of thousands of designs, or is it more efficient in silico than an RFDiffusion pipeline? You mention in the paper that BindCraft outputs statistics from each design run, and that biasing away from alpha helical binders reduces the in silico design success rate; so it sounds like you have the statistics ready to hand, at least for the targets reported in the paper. I’d love to see these design success rates added to a table, either in the main paper or the SI. Another thing I’d like to see is some quantification of the compute time and cost required to run the 4-step pipeline until 100 designs pass the in silico filters. I understand this cost scales with target/binder size and target difficulty, but I would imagine you have the data required to calculate these metrics at least for the design campaigns reported in the paper. I saw on Twitter that you’re working on a direct BindCraft / RFDiffusion pipeline comparison; I hope you’ll include the computational hardware and total CPU/GPU time for each side of that design campaign.

Simply put: I know that low p-values require sufficient sampling, so do you, and so do readers of the paper."" This seems disingenuous. First, you were not replying to the incorrect phrasing of ""the highest p-values"" and ""elevated p-values"", but to ""better p-values"" In my response to your response, I was clearly referring to elevated relative risk, elevated signal in your heat map, elevated statistical signifigance. I did incorrectly say elevated p-values this time, and for that I apologize, but my points still stand. Whether or not people know that better p-values (lower values, higher statistical significance) come from more sampling is irrelevant. I was not addressing how people would interpret them. I was addressing what could be concluded from them: The highest signal for relative risk (and the lowest p-values for elevated relative risk) does not colocalize with the stalls selling wild animals. Lowering the resolution to just the south-west portion of the market broadens the scope to essentially being equivalent to saying it coincides with where they sampled. ""it's clear that you get the point that 'all viruses aren't equal' and are now moving the goalposts. That's a game you're going to have to play alone."" Au contraire, it's a game you must play alone. You are the one that spoke of different distributions depending on hosts (and transmission methods):""identical regardless of their hosts and modes of transmission,"" As the paper heavily focuses on the raccoon dog as a host (and statements to the lay media do as well), which is the same host, and has the same transmission method (respiratory). I used data that you yourself saw fit to present, to address ""goalposts"" that you set, so I don't understand this objection. Of course, all viruses aren't equal, but we have to make due with the data we have. If we move from different (proposed) hosts, to specifically CoVs: -then the data still clearly shows an association between bamboorat mt reads and bamboo rat cov reads. It also works pretty well for canineCoVs The data is even able to show a correlation between a CoV, and the predator of the CoV's host (snakes and rats) https://i.imgur.com/prBYydu.png Yet it can't show a correlation with SARS-CoV-2 and a proposed intermediate host, I find this strange. ""the way you interpret this is inappropriately ignoring sampling differences between January 1 and January 12. This is a mistake you introduce and is not in Bloom 2024."" I do not ignore them at all, which is why I specifically linked to Bloom's figure 1: https://academic.oup.com/view-large/figure/436646794/vead089f1.tif If we only look at January 12 (so no sampling differences to account for), then SARS-CoV-2 reads are orders of magnitude less abundant than other CoVs seen at the market. On the interactive plot ( https://jbloom.github.io/Huanan_market_samples_addtl_analysis/viral_counts.html), you have to play ""find the pixel"" to get the number of SARS-CoV-2 reads: *20 total from 12 January. In contrast: * 1207 Bamboo rat CoVs (>60x more reads) * 900 canine CoV HeB-G1 reads (45x more) * 551 canine CoV SD-F3 reads (27.5x more) * 319 Rabbit CoV HKU14 reads (16x more) Even the hedgehog viruses have more reads (44 and 45), 4.5x more reads (combined) Why is it that sampling the wildlife stalls was able to detect all these other CoVs in such great abundance, but SARS-CoV-2 barely registered? Isn't the hypothesis supposed to be intense transmission among traded animals kept in poor condiditions, close together in cages, enabling multiple spillovers into humans after many probing mutations/infections? There's no such evidence of that in these samples, just a few scattered reads consistent with shedding from humans passing by. For that matter, isn't the 1 Jaunary sampling less biased? sampling around where the first signs of human infection were noticed within the market? I notice that you and your co-authors did not touch on why it seems none of the wildlife vendors got sick, in contrast to previous market zoonoses (ie: 2002-2003 SARS outbreaks) "" 'even when stratifying by collection date, clear negative correlations still come up' -- sorry I have no idea what this means in context."" https://dictionary.cambridge.org/fr/dictionnaire/anglais/stratifying stratifying: ""to arrange the different parts of something in separate layers or groups"" As per above, and Bloom 2024, if you group the samples by collection date, even in the 12 January collection date group, it clearly doesn't correlate with the wildlife reads. "" you wrote, 'I see nothing new here,' yet then and now you are referencing quite a bit of analysis in our paper."" Allow me to be more precise: I see nothing new of significance here that supports a market origin. You can always do a new analysis, but it won't neccessarily tell us anything new: * We already knew where the stalls were that sold wildlife * We already knew that live wildlife was being sold and which species (Xiao 2021), - notably, this analysis doesn't establish which wildlife was sold live. * Heatmaps of relative risk, which pointed to the mahjong rooms and bathrooms more than any stalls selling wildlife had already been published. * We already knew that there was a lineage A sequence generated from a market sample So from the above, I am left wondering, what are the new conclusions or inferences that can be drawn from this analysis? To me the most interesting one is the source of the raccoon dogs: Xiao 2021 did not report it. The evidence presented here obviously points to them being locally caught, but you and your co-authors did not seem to assign any significance to this. Instead, there is a statement to the effect that the full geographic range of these SNPs is unknown, leaving it uncertain where the raccoon dogs come from, ending up in an identical scenario to that of Xiao 2021, which also leaves the source of the raccoon dogs unknown. So yes, there is more analysis here, but I don't see that it helps answer any questions, or when it does (raccoon dog source), this is dismissed. ""You're also free to flesh out your 'mahjong/bathrooms' origins theory"" I have proposed no such theory of the origin. I am simply stating the fact that the heat maps produced from this data using your parameters show higher elevated risk (and higher statistical significance to that elevated risk) around those locations than around the stalls where wildlife was present. This fact suggests that the heat maps reflect significant human to human transmission within the market, not the origin of the virus, at the time it was sampled. That is not a theory on origin, just an interpretation of the heat maps. I would add that it also suggests that circulation among wildlife at the virus prior to the market closing (exact time period unclear) was low at best - which is also somewhat surprising given that we have seen plenty of cases of human to animal transmission of SARs-CoV-2 (deer, mink farms, domestic animals, zoo animals, etc), which may argue against any significant susceptibility of the animals t0 the pre-D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2.",2024-10-07T08:22:46,disqus_25ZToSOvrx,Ema Nymton,10.1101/2023.09.13.557637,Genetic tracing of market wildlife and viruses at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Alexander Crits-Christoph, Joshua I.

Behavioral regulation by enteric neurons is poorly understood and this manuscript address this gap by comprehensively characterizing the functions of Gr43a expressing enteric neurons using multiple approaches. We were particularly impressed by the assay developed and used in Figure 6 to monitor sucrose transit through the gut as well as the technically challenging imaging of enteric neurons. Overall, this manuscript is a major addition to the growing body of work on enteric neurons (see other recent articles on enteric neurons here: https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-024-01020-z and https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2866-8). The figures are excellent and nicely complement the streamlined manuscript. We have very few minor suggestions that the authors could choose to address during their revisions. •	Figure 3H and I: While the XZ plane convincingly shows that Gr43a neurons innervate the foregut lumen, it is difficult to decipher the differences in anatomy between the two classes. Stochastic labelling techniques such as MultiColor FlpOut could assist in visualizing the morphological differences between the two sets of neurons. •	Figure 4B: It is not clear to the readers why the response with EN-3 was statistically significant but the response EN-4 wasn’t. We did not observe any drastic differences in the two responses in Extended data Figure 4. Besides this one question that would be worth addressing is whether Gr43a is required in these neurons for the response to sugar or other gustatory receptors (if expressed) in these neurons mediate the response. Perhaps something to address in the future.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.12.607533v2#comment-6563744659,biorxivstage,3,"We read this paper as part of a journal club, and have decided to compile a collective review and publicly share it with the authors. This was inspired by the Arcadia Science Preprint Review Pizza Party Initiative, and this represents our fourth preprint review. Ji et al. present a transformer-based foundation model, called Prophet, which stands for Predictor of Phenotypes. The authors train Prophet on a variety of data modalities including gene expression, cell viability, chemical structures, and cell morphology using publicly-available sources. The authors should be commended for using such vast and disparate resources for such an innovative approach. The task of Prophet is to predict assay endpoints, such as cell viability, and to learn a useful embedding space which can be mined to identify novel, and potentially impactful, relationships. Most often, the phenotype prediction is in the context of some form of perturbation. The authors present a variety of benchmarks comparing Prophet to other methods, and they present both in vitro and in vivo applications to demonstrate potential use-cases. The applications range from looking up untested compounds that are similar to clinically-relevant compounds and predicting zebrafish cell type proportions after gene knockout. Overall, Prophet is methodologically interesting and the applications demonstrate that the method may help generate hypotheses at a low cost. However, we have several major and minor concerns mostly to do with clarity, performance, and software. Major concerns: 1. Unclear and inconsistent terminology and definitions. a. It is unclear exactly what the authors mean by “phenotype”. It seems that sometimes the term is being used interchangeably with prediction/output but other times it is being used to describe observable physical properties. Additionally, the authors refer to gene expression as a phenotype, and, while technically true, it could be confusing given the authors are also using cell morphology as a phenotype. Furthermore, it is unclear if the authors are describing the collection of genes in the gene expression vector, for example, as the phenotype, or, if it is just a single gene. This confusion is also related to our confusion about model outputs (whether the output is a single element or a vector representation; see below). Given the word is in the article’s title, it seems particularly important. b. The terminology of “experiments” is also unclear. The authors claim to use 4.7 million experiments, but does this refer to plates, conditions, samples, something else? How did the authors calculate this count? c. At times, it is unclear what format the input data are and at what level of processing. What are the different possibilities of input data and how might a user decide which to use? Can a user input multiple kinds of data? Did the authors apply any sort of post-processing or quality control? d. The output of Prophet is ambiguous. Does Prophet predict a single value per input (or different inputs), or, does it predict a cell state vector? The authors describe outputting a one-hot encoding. Does this refer to the output phenotype? What is this structure? The authors write: “we train Prophet to predict cell viability, compound IC50, Cell Painting morphology features, mRNA transcript abundance, and cell type proportion.” Does this mean Prophet will output all of these predictions if the data you have is only morphology features? Does a user have control over these decisions? Furthermore, the authors write ""Prophet’s transfer learning capability is not limited to phenotypes seen during the pre-training stage. We did not pre-train Prophet on any morphological measurement, but Prophet fine-tuned on JUMP outperformed both the Prophet-individual model trained only on JUMP and the baseline (Fig. 2b).” What is being predicted from the JUMP data? Morphology feature profiles? Images? Drug class or MOA? This needs to be expanded upon to make these claims. Please clarify the output structure and how a user will interact with the output. Figure 1C does not make this clear. e. Critical methodological details are discussed without sufficient detail. For example, the data split and validation strategies were ambiguous. How were training, test, and validation splits handled? What partitioning methods, if any, were used? The three-fold cross-validation procedure also lacked clarity. Were all datasets used in cross-validation? How did individual data-set models training differ and influence the full model fine-tuning? What is the specific pseudobulking procedure for RNA? 2. Unclear justification for Prophet architecture decisions a. The authors present table S3, which provides hyperparameters. How are these justified? For example, the choice of GeLU over alternatives like ReLU or SiLU. Why use an embedding dimension of 512? Were alternative configurations explored? How would modifying individual architecture decisions impact performance? b. 20.1 M parameters is a fairly small transformer, will this model need to grow as more perturbations or data types are added? In other words, how long will this model be foundational until the next best model is released? c. Encoders sequentially relate inputs with a positional embedding. Does this architecture use a positional embedding in the encoder? What does the position represent? 3. Concerns about model comparisons, baselines, and performance a. The authors compare Prophet to much simpler machine learning models (random forest, MLP, linear regression), individual Prophet models (trained using only one modality), and a mean baseline representing the average value of that intervention. The authors write: “This approach follows the same strategy as current foundation models (19, 36, 37), which are pre-trained on large amounts of data and then fine-tuned for specific datasets using the pre-trained model as a backbone.” Why not use these current foundation models as benchmarks for Prophet? The authors should also consider comparing different transformer architectures and non-transformer models (e.g., state-space models) as well. b. Prophet’s performance is low. The highest R2 value is 0.27 with a low of -0.03 and many predictions that perform the same as the mean baseline. Given the low, variable performance, it is difficult to trust Prophet’s output, or, at best, understand which outputs may have incorrect predictions. The authors claim an R2 improvement as low as 0.04 represents a 13x increase in number of hits, but it is unclear how the authors calculate this value. The authors also claim Prophet reduces “the number of experiments needed for viability screens by at least 60x” What statistics are calculating this estimate? c. The ML model comparisons compared to baseline are incredibly low. Results in Figure 2B suggest that the mean is a better predictor than nearly 100% of ML-based predictions (mean baseline is better in 41/45 comparisons). Our guess is that something might be going wrong in the model training or evaluation procedures. d. It is confusing if there is only one “final” Prophet model or if there are multiple “final” Prophet models since each must be fine-tuned to single datasets. Why not fine-tune on all datasets? Figure 2A suggests that for each time you perform inference in a new data category (e.g., cell morphology vs. gene expression), fine-tuning is required? If so, this strategy will lead to variable predictions and perhaps unexpected results and this is not a foundational model, but, at best, a foundational architecture. e. The authors performed a critical analysis, in which they restricted the amount of training data by 50%, 30%, 20%, 10%, and 5%. The authors state: “We found a clear trend: the more treatments and cell states seen by Prophet, the higher the confidence in the predictions (Fig. 2g).” This is an expected result, however, it is unclear how Figure 2G supports this statement. What is an “axis holdout”? Standard deviation of R2 for which predictions? What do the different points represent? How does this show confidence? 4. Concerns about limited discussion of technical artifacts a. The authors mention technical variation in the limitations section, but this should be elaborated upon. How might Prophet’s performance be impacted by technical artifacts? b. Earlier in the manuscript, the authors write: “We universally decompose each experiment into a unique combination of three fundamental elements—the cellular state, the treatments being performed, and the intended phenotypic readout.” Signals from technical artifacts are likely a fourth fundamental element, or, at the least, there should be an experiment to test the impact of technical artifacts. 5. Concerns about publicly-available source code on Github a. We provide a full GitHub review following our manuscript review below. Minor concerns - Pg. 3 ln 5, the authors write: “To train it, we collected 9 perturbational datasets to create the largest compendium of publicly available screening datasets to date:...” The language suggests that these datasets were all collected by this group, but the datasets are all publicly available. Also, the Figure S1 reference probably should point to Figure S2. JUMP is listed three times in Figure S2 (one for compound, one for genetic treatment, and then one for both) Why is it listed for both when it is already split into the two perturbation types? Also, the right subplot in S2B (the complexity trade-off) is a bit misleading. JUMP has far higher complexity than PRISM, for instance, but this graph would suggest otherwise. Perhaps the missing piece not described here is readout complexity? - Figure 1B is a bit difficult to understand. For example, the bullet points for the “intervention” box don’t seem like interventions? It seems like these should be listed elsewhere or the heading should be changed. How is a “gene sequence embedding” an intervention data transformation? - The authors should tamp down claims. For example, the authors write “We did not pre-train Prophet on any morphological measurement, but Prophet fine-tuned on JUMP outperformed both the Prophet-individual model trained only on JUMP and the baseline”. The performance is only marginally improved (0.01). The authors retrained the zebrafish Prophet model, but it would be helpful to see performance for the original prophet model applied. - What is a pre-built plate? “To do so, we used a setup with existing pre-built 384-well plates, each with 352 unique drug perturbations applied to 9 cancer cell lines (Table S9). In total, there were 16 pre-built plates.” GitHub comments and concerns 1. Documentation and Usability a. The README provided by the author is well-structured, offering clear instructions on installation, usage, and licensing, which provides a strong starting point for using Prophet. This level of clarity is especially valuable for researchers and users who are new to the tool. b. While the README provides a good overview, the documentation around model training is sparse. It would be beneficial to include an explanation in the README on how the model was trained and provide a small explanation of the embeddings captured. More detailed usage/inference examples would enhance comprehension.  It’s also unclear how users can apply the method to their own datasets. This will offer quick and easy access for users to understand the functionality and purpose of Prophet. c. Commented-out code and TODOs are scattered throughout the scripts. Best practices suggest removing unused code to reduce clutter and confusion. Example: prophet/ http://model.py #L12. 2. Software Environment and Dependencies a. Users may face reproducibility challenges when trying to set up the software, particularly due to missing environment isolation. Creating an isolated Conda environment or improving instructions around environment setup would help ensure users avoid dependency conflicts. b. The project uses an older version of Pandas (1.5.x), despite newer versions being available with important fixes. Updating the Pandas version would improve compatibility and performance. c. A http://setup.py and requirements.txt are both provided but are not used together, creating confusion over proper environment management. d. No Python version range is specified in the http://setup.py, which led to issues with earlier Python versions (3.8, 3.9). Python 3.10 worked, but this should be clarified for future users. e. The provided notebook requires a specific version of NumPy that differs from what is stated in http://setup.py. Errors occur with newer versions. NumPy 1.24.4 was found to work, but this should be addressed in the dependencies. f. We were able to install it into a Linux machine. However, an error occurs when attempting to install the software on macOS. The error reports: “ERROR: No matching distribution found for scipy==1.14.0” g. A Jupyter notebook is included, but Jupyter is not listed as a dependency in the http://setup.py or requirements.txt, which prevents seamless execution within the provided environment. 3. Other comments a. The repository does not include any software tests or automated testing via GitHub Actions or similar tools. Incorporating automated testing would help validate the code’s functionality and improve its robustness. b. The code does not pass several linting checks (e.g., through dslinter), highlighting the need for improved code quality and adherence to data science best practices. c. The repository lacks key community health files like http://CONTRIBUTING.md and http://CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, which are important for guiding open-source contributions and user interactions. d. Data provided in .xlsx format (e.g., via Figshare) can cause formatting errors and is less open-access friendly than formats like .csv. Switching to a more stable format would improve accessibility and avoid errors. e. In the tutorial notebook, the code blocks are not executed in a sequential order, which can lead to potential bugs. This lack of sequential execution means that changes made in earlier cells may not be reflected in subsequent cells, resulting in inconsistencies or errors in functionality. 4. Recommendations for Improvement a. Address installation issues: Fixing the bugs related to installation and setup should be a priority, as they could deter users from exploring Prophet further. Ensuring an isolated environment setup (e.g., using Conda) would help resolve these issues. b. Enforce version control for dependencies: Better organization of http://setup.py and requirements.txt, as well as enforcing version control for dependencies, would enhance reliability. c. Expand the README: Adding a table of contents, additional usage examples, and sections on contributing guidelines and testing procedures would make the README more comprehensive. d. Adopt best software practices: Implementing clear setup instructions, enforcing dependency version control, and organizing the code more effectively would increase usability and accessibility for a wider scientific audience.
