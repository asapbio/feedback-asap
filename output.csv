That said, I do agree it would have been of greater scientific interest to assess fluent speakers of less naturalistic conlangs like Toki Pona or Lojban.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.30.610541v1#comment-6562075341,biorxivstage,1,"We discussed this paper in our Journal Club and the comments arising from our Discussion are the following: 1) Why focus on “rhizosphere soil” rather than “ bulk soil” to study the dynamics of fungal functional groups in fields of different age? The rationale behind that choice is not clearly explained, most of the references used in the Introduction and Discussion sections to explain the effect of time since planting on functional groups come from soil studies rather than rhizosphere studies. The term “field age” is also misleading as it suggests that bulk soil was sampled, and other terms such as “plant age” could maybe be considered. 2) There were no replicates per field age, as only one field per age was considered, although we understand that different plots were sampled per field. Other parameters than “field age” could cause the observed effects on fungal functional guilds, such as differences in soil nutrients between fields, for example. As seen in the PCoA, fields C and D (both classified as “old fields”) are different in terms of fungal community structure. Including replicate fields would have allowed to avoid possible confounding effects. 3) Important details are missing from the field description. Considering the Discussion on the possible effects of fertilization and fungicide applications, information should be added on the agrochemical management of these plots. Was it similar across fields? Across sampling years? Information regarding the soil nutrient status, and possible climatic variations between the two years of sampling, should also be included. 4) Methodological bias was also discussed. For example, most fungal taxa identified with the UNITE database would not be able to be assigned to a functional guild. How did you account for these taxa that could not be included into a functional category? Another possible bias that was discussed is the fact that relative abundance data may not represent what is actually occurring in the rhizosphere: absolute abundance data would also be needed and should be used for the implementation of microbial networks. 5) The discussion could also benefit from adding some consideration on the “functional group” categorization. How categorical is a “functional group”? Mortierella for example is listed as a saprotroph but it can also act as a plant pathogen. Mycorrhizal fungi included both EMF and AMF, yet strawberry only form symbiosis with AMF. As the focus of this study is on strawberry rhizosphere, why not discuss possible strawberry pathogens and symbionts? 6) An effect of plant genotype was not detected on relative abundance nor richness of fungal functional guilds. However, significant effects may be found in terms of taxa composition. Why not include such analysis in the study? Other minor comments are enlisted below. Abstract Results seem to report differences in soil fungi rather than rhizosphere fungi. Why the focus on rhizosphere and not bulk soil? Plant genotype is not mentioned in the Results either, yet it was mentioned in the Background section as an important determinant of microbiomes. Introduction L50: “The essential functions of soil microbiomes, such as pathogenesis, mutualism, and decomposition…”. Is pathogenesis a function? Functions of the soil microbiomes could rather include maintenance of soil structure, fertility, plant productivity… L66: Research gap: “Despite their significance, our knowledge of the dynamics of different fungal functional groups that co-exist in rhizosphere soil microbiomes is limited (Zanne et al. 2020; Martinović et al. 2021)”. The importance of filling this research gap is not clearly explained. L69: “Soil fungal functional groups can be dynamic in the plant rhizosphere. For example, fungal pathogens can accumulate over time, especially in monocultures or ecosystems with low plant species diversity (Cook 2006; Li et al. 2014; Peralta et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2023a)”. These references are for soil, not rhizosphere. Second paragraph of the Introduction: mostly on soil build-up of pathogens, and possible decrease of AMF over time. But this section seems to address the effect of long-term cropping, not plant age (rhizosphere). The rationale behind the selection of rhizosphere as the soil compartment to be studied is needed. You may want to check paper by Sun et al. (2022), published in Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, on the dynamics of fungal functional guilds in the rhizosphere of wheat. Methods Why establish and sample plots (20 x 20 cm) and not plants if rhizosphere soil was considered? Is there only 1 plant per plot (i.e. 3 plants sampled per genotype and field age)? It is unclear. Were the same plants sampled in 2021 and 2022? If not, a plant effect could be observed between both years. Results L205: The increase in pathogens in the older fields is observed for one sampling year only (the pattern does not hold in 2022), yet it is described (and discussed) as a general finding. What happened in 2022 with AMF that decreased dramatically in all fields (both in relative abundance and in richness)? It is briefly discussed as possibly caused by the fertilization regime, which is not described. Differences in community composition could be assessed statistically to test for significant differences in taxon relative abundance between fields or sampling years. Regarding your Figures, stating the age of the field in the “x” axis rather than letters “A”, “B”, etc., could be more informative. Discussion The discussion on the accumulation of pathogens over time is also based on references on soil microbiomes, not rhizosphere microbiomes. Were the same plants sampled in 2021 and 2022? L301: fungicide applications are mentioned to explain the “levelling off” of pathogens in older fields (C and D). Any data on application rates and application dates? This is important if fungal communities are studied. How specific were these agrochemicals? How were they applied? L311-312: Fusarium is a large genus with many species, not all are pathogens. Making inferences such as “the causal agent of Fusarium wilt in strawberry” is a bit far-stretched. Which Fusarium species are actual strawberry pathogens? The whole discussion regarding the potential accumulation of pathogens in the rhizosphere calls for symptom incidence data. It is something that was measured? L387: “the similarity in fungal functional groups across genotypes observed in this study may indicate functional redundancies and stable essential functions of microbiomes.” The microbiome was not studied and differences may be reflected in bacterial communities rather than fungal ones.",2024-10-02T09:06:19,frdriquereverchon,Frédérique Reverchon,10.1101/2024.08.30.610541,Contrasting dynamics of soil fungal functional groups in the plant rhizosphere,"Na Wei, Madelynn Nakaji-Conley",2024-09-02

First, the authors showed that iPSCs could efficiently differentiate into pericyte-like cells, express pericyte specific markers, and promote angiogenesis, barrier integrity and contractility. They then investigated the differences between iPLCs derived from healthy individuals and those derived from AD patients carrying APPswe mutations. Compared to controls, APPswe iPLCs exhibited a distinct expression of pericyte markers, were able to secrete amyloid beta 1-40 and 1-42 within the media, had an altered transcriptome for key genes involved in cytoskeleton reorganization and metabolic regulation, were more sensitive to mediators of inflammation, and showed compromised angiogenesis, barrier integrity and hypercontractility. Overall, the manuscript uses a novel approach (iPLCs) to investigate an interesting and sometimes overlooked topic - the specific contribution of pericytes to AD pathology and vascular disfunction. Previous work conducted in in vitro BBB models showed that pericytes play a key role in amyloid clearance contributing to the removal of aggregated Aβ from brain capillaries (Ma et al, Mol Neurodegeneration 13, 57 (2018) and Blanchard et al, Nat Med. 2020 Jun;26(6):952-963). Here, the authors focus on the contribution of pericytes in amyloid secretion, emphasizing the novelty of their research. However, the high variability within datasets and the small number of replicates raises some concern. Major comments •	The statement “…overproduce beta-amyloid” in the manuscript title suggests that pericytes have a significant role in Aβ production. Although the authors showed that APPswe iPLCs could secrete 10 times more Aβ1-42 than the control cells, the Aβ1-42 levels are 100 times lower than neurons. Thus, the authors concluded that “contribution of pericytes to total brain amyloid load in AD is limited”. The title should be changed to indicate the main findings of the work and should be supported by the data presented. •	APPswe iPLCs were derive from 3 donors versus iPLCs from 7 healthy controls. Importantly, among the donors, only one had AD, while the others had pre-symptomatic AD or no symptomatology (in this case the mutation was introduced using CRISPR-Cas9 as reported in the methods). The variability in AD cases plus the differences in symptomatology may skew the results and may contribute to the high variability shown in several graphs (Figure 2 A, B, C, F, J). Figures •	The authors should be consistent in the number of replicates used: different groups in the graphs show only 1 or 2 replicates, even for control cell lines, which makes the reader question the reproducibility and accuracy of their findings (see Figures 1B, 1I, 1K, 2H, 2J, 4E). •	The authors should clarify the findings reported in Figures 2E and 2H: the figures are similar, but it is not clear if iPLCs in 2H derive from APPswe iPLCs (as reported in the figure legend) or control. •	The authors should correct Figures 1A and 2I as sample labels are missing. The authors should also modify the arrows used in Figure 2I and 2D as it is not clear to what they are pointing. Scale bars should be added on both images since they show different magnification. •	Figures should be arranged in a consistent manner e.g., same format and order should be used consistently. Discussion •	An interesting finding is that the HIF1a pathway is downregulated in APPswe iPLCs (Figure 3B). The authors should mention this finding in the discussion. This finding could also support the fact that APPswe cells have decreased VEGF levels and impaired angiogenesis and no change in BACE1 levels (as VEGF and BACE1 are HIF1a target genes). •	For future experiments, the authors should discuss whether APPswe iPLCs exhibit differences in oxidative stress, ROS production and mitochondrial activity compared to controls. •	For future experiments, the authors should use cell lines and human-derived cells as models as they may reveal differences from iPLCs. Minor comments •	The authors measured the changes in expression of several pericytes associated genes in Figure 1. However, it is not clear why the authors were not consistent with these specific genes for their further analysis. For example, in Figure 1B they measured PDGFRB, DES, LAMA2, DLC1, and PDE7B while in 1C they measured LAMA2, PDE7B, DES, omitting PDGFRB but adding genes ACTA2 and CD248. Then, all genes were analyzed in Figure 2A-B. Thus, the authors should provide change in expression data for all genes (PDGFRB, LAMA2, DLC1, CD248, PDE7B, ACTA2, DES) in 1B and 1C or provide reasoning for leaving some out. •	Please correct the repeated sentences on page 5: “…which are known to express detectable levels of LRP121 (Figure 2 J). Furthermore, when iPLCs were subjected to pHrodo-conjugated zymosan-coated beads, no uptake of these pathogen-mimicking particles was observed (data not shown). Thus, it appears that the phagocytic activity of these iPLCs is low.” •	Additional edits for word choice and sentence construction are also needed, e.g., pg 10, 2nd to last paragraph, 2nd to last sentence is awkward. Decision for the editor: Major revisions The manuscript presents a novel idea that could advance the AD/CAA field but, at this stage, I have several major concerns regarding reproducibility and possible accuracy of the described findings. I would consider the manuscript for publication only if all major concerns are addressed by the authors.",2024-10-01T18:51:48,,Maria Valle,10.1101/2024.06.07.597867,Human iPSC-derived pericyte-like cells carrying APP Swedish mutation overproduce beta-amyloid and induce cerebral amyloid angiopathy-like changes,"Ying-Chieh Wu, Šárka Lehtonen, Kalevi Trontti, Riitta Kauppinen, Pinja Kettunen, Ville Leinonen, Markku Laakso, Johanna Kuusisto, Mikko Hiltunen, Iiris Hovatta, Kristine Freude, Hiramani Dhungana, Jari Koistinaho, Taisia Rolova",2024-06-07

The authors used a SIEMENS WIP sequence of segmented 3D-EPI at a Terra scanner with 0.8mm isotropic resolution during a finger tapping task to see if they can detect previously reported activation in the upper and deeper layer of human M1. The study combines advanced hardware (novel 7T) with advanced sequences (segmented 3D-EPI) and advanced processing (phase-based QSM and laminar signal pooling). Each step is of interest to the MRM readership. The study is overall well described. And the study design is clear. I believe that every design choice is justified and relevant for the overall research question: feasibility of laminar fQSM. In the emerging field of layer-fMRI, there is a big research focus on finding acquisition and analysis methods with the best compromise of sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility. There are about 70 papers about this topic published already. The manuscript at hands augments this literature with a modern set of tools and innovative combination of established methods. The layer results are a bit messy. Layer profiles in Figs. 4 and 6 look quite noisy. This is partly expected for the ambitiously accelerated protocols used here (GRAPPA 6 and 12). The results are consistent enough to claim “feasibility of fQSM”. No group average layer profiles are shown (unclear if group results would be clearer?!?). I recommend the publication of this manuscript with a few small suggestions of revisions to be considered. I list them below: 1.) It is not really clear to me how the M1 ROI was selected. Some previous studies exclusively focused the analysis on the evolutionary older part of M1 (BA4a). (e.g. outlined here: https://layerfmri.com/2018/03/13/finding-roi-of-the-double-layers-in-m1/). Maybe the authors can state how they defined their ROIs? 2.) It is not trivial to obtain interpretable phase data with EPI. given that the authors use CAIPI field of view shifting, they must use the icepat reconstruction from SIEMENS. This framework does not allow saving RF channels uncombined. So it might be helpful to the reader if the authors can state which coil combination method was used? Some of the default EPI Nyquist phase correction methods calibrate the global phase on a TR by TR basis. This would make it harder to interpret functional phase changes. Maybe the authors can mention in the manuscript, which phase correction was used. 3.)  For some of the protocols, Partial Fourier was applied in two directions. This is surprising to me. In my understanding, partial Frontier imaging is based on the assumption that when the image is real (no imaginary part), k-space is point-symmetric. This can be helpful to obtain magnitude data in Partial Fourier without much loss in resolution. But I am not sure if this also applies to phase data. Doing partial Fourier with phase imaging sounds like reconstructing a phase with an algorithm that assumes that there is no phase in the first place. Doing additional partial Fourier in the second phase encoding direction is even more surprising to me. The k-space symmetry is a point symmetry, not an axis symmetry. This means that doing a double partial Fourier results in complete loss of high resolution information in two diagonal directions. Maybe I am misunderstanding something. If authors agree with my worries, they could include a statement in the manuscript stating that their resolution might be affected by Partial Fourier imaging. Maybe they can state in the manuscript which partial Fourier algorithm was used? I believe POCS is not available in IcePat? 4.) The acquisition protocol is relatively ambitious. With extremely large coverage (80-212 slices) and high acceleration factors (GRAPPA 6-12). In the field of layer-fMRI, there are currently only first cautious attempts in the field to get towards whole-brain imaging. But due to the high noise level of these protocols, whole brain layer fmri required up to 51 runs (e.g. see Kenshu dataset). Here, the acquisition protocol is covering large parts of the brain, while ‘only’ activating the sensory motor system. This means that the feasibility test investigated here refers to a worst case scenario for generalizable acquisition protocols. For more tailored, brain-area-specific protocols with smaller FOV and with less required acceleration, and shorter TRs, the results might be even more robust. 5) Stylistic comment: Figures 1,3,5,6 use the term “fMRI” as GE-BOLD. I think this could be confusing. Technically fQSM and VASO are also fMRI. Similarly in Tab. 1 BOLD is referred to at 3D-EPI, whoever VASO is also using 3D-EPI.

I note that it also does not address the points raised in Bloom 2024. It only tangentially addresses 2 points in my post, both of which are apparently misconstrued. The first point that was addressed was about the p-values- however this response did not acurately portray the argument. My post never said it was misleading, but rather that the sampling bias towards the stalls would concentrate the highest p-values near the stalls, even more so than a simple relative-risk heatmap would, making the result of elevated p-values near the stalls expected whether or not the stalls were the origin of the outbreak. Compare: https://i.imgur.com/iDD6D93.jpeg to https://i.imgur.com/2YmYlZp.png The second point ""an argument that implicitly assumes all expectations for all coronaviruses are identical regardless of their hosts and modes of transmission,"" No, it does not assume they are ""identical"", but rather that there are general similarities. I am asking for an explanation why the distribution is so different. Neither mode of transmission nor host explain this - nor does date of sampling. While not explicitly stated, there is a substantial focus on Raccoon dogs. You show the distribution of a virus with the same putative host (Raccoon dogs) and same transmission methods (respiratory). The distributions are strikingly different. Compare https://i.imgur.com/iDD6D93.jpeg to https://i.imgur.com/OFXpCIf.jpeg This paper argued (in preprint), and it still argues )in final published form) that the 12 Jan RNA had more time to decay. Considering the market was closed at the same time, why did the SARS-CoV-2 reads decay to such lower values than other CoVs in samples from the same dates, and within the same samples, as shown by Bloom? See here: https://i.imgur.com/kIOTTYq.jpeg -even when stratifying by collection date, clear negative correlations still come up. Overall, I find that a lot of speculation is offered, but it comes accross as excuses for the data not actually showing that the virus originated from the wildlife stalls. I'll also raise additional critiques now: 1) The heat maps do not colocalize with the potential hosts: SARS-CoV-2 (RR p-values) and Raccoon dog reads shown here: https://i.imgur.com/AyAiag9.jpeg In the paper, instead the focus is on the south-west portion of the market. As I see it, there are two possibilities: i) The analysis DOES have sufficient resolution: in which case the resulting heat map not co-localizing with the wildlife stalls would exonerate them ii) The analysis DOES NOT have sufficient resolution: in which case it must be noted that the eastern and northern parts of the market were very poorly sampled. In this case, finding more positive samples where more samples were taken does not allow any conclusions to be drawn. 2) The analysis of the SNPs of the Raccoon dogs clearly aligns with the the SNPs of locally caught wildlife (the C14859A + A15304G genome from Hubei, and the C14372T, C15102A, C15252A, T15306C genome from Hubei). Despite the evidence clearly pointing to locally caught raccoon dogs, speculation is offered (again) that maybe racoon dogs with these SNPs are found further south. Notably, Hubei (the local province) is not a plausible origin of the progenitor. Pekar seemingly agrees: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.12.548617v1 In essence, this paper shows: i) 3 lineage B sequences 1 low quality lineage A sequence have a (very very wide) tMRCA confidence interval that overlaps with a tMRCA calculated from many more A and B lineage genomes: hardly anything surprising or something that conclusions can be drawn from ii) Within the heavily sampled area of the market, the areas of elevated relative risk don't actually overlap with the locations of the wildlife stalls -There is just one stall on the periphery of an area of elevated risk, the one closest to the entrance/mah jong rooms/bathrooms, which is where the higest elevated risk is. iii) The raccoon dog genomes from that stall suggest that they are locally caught, and do not come from areas with potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2's precursors On balance, the sum of this evidence seems to suggest that the HSM wildlife stalls in general, and raccoon dogs specifically, were not the origin of this virus. Much speculation and many excuses are offered, but it must be reiterated that these excuses and speculation, not evidence. The correlation analysis of Bloom can point right to the hosts of other viruses. The heat maps produced for this paper can point right to the hosts of other viruses. SARS-CoV-2 continuously fails to produce evidence and associations that other animal viruses at the market produced. The way these findings are presented in the paper and to the general public through the media seems to be at odds with what the data actually shows.",2024-09-30T08:04:04,disqus_25ZToSOvrx,Ema Nymton,10.1101/2023.09.13.557637,Genetic tracing of market wildlife and viruses at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Alexander Crits-Christoph, Joshua I.

Not sure where to discuss after the paper was published, but wanted to add some insight regarding the endogenously purified Pks13 protein used for cryoEM, crosslinking mass spec, and LC-MS (for identification of endogenous lipid). As it's published at NSMB, the paper doesn't address the fact that the endogenously purified Pks13 used for the above mentioned experiments, using the same purification protocol each time, showed variable SEC traces. After a while, we could not reproduce the peak1 and peak2 peaks in SEC (shown in Extended data fig1), but the two peaks either overlapped, or peak1 essentially disappeared. Sometimes, other interacting proteins were also pulled down along with Pks13, which confounded the SEC traces. CryoEM was done with peak1 with TAM inhibitor added, while XL-MS and LC-MS were done with mixed peak1&2 species. Protein used for XL-MS also had ""contaminant"" species which could actually be functionally-relevant binding partner. Since these protein preps behaved differently in SEC, we are not sure about the functional ramifications of these proteins purified at different times.

However, having a major conclusion and an implication that Mac1 inhibitors are not antiviral based solely on negative data is misleading. We have published that a macrodomain inhibitor can inhibit virus replication (PMID: 38592023) and will have another story that will soon be available in BioRxiv that describes even more Mac1 targeting compounds that inhibit virus replication. There are some notable problems with the compound described here that could explain its lack of antiviral activity that should be taken into account. Again, I think the novel chemistry identified in this paper is exceptional, but more cautiousness should be taken before making broad claims that this is not a good drug target. Based on genetic data Mac1 and another recent paper on bioRxiv ( https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.08.606661), it appears that Mac1 is a suitable target for antiviral development, and we are continuing to work to see that dream come to fruition.",2024-09-24T16:44:20,thefehrlab,The Fehr Lab,10.1101/2024.08.19.608619,Discovery of potent SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 macrodomain inhibitors uncovers lack of translation to cellular antiviral response,"Alpha A.

Keating, and Gene-Wei Li (MIT): We thank CJ San Felipe, Priyanka Bajaj, and James Fraser for their thoughtful review of our manuscript, “High-throughput computational discovery of inhibitory protein fragments with AlphaFold” ( bioRxiv 2023.12.19.572389). We were pleased the reviewers appreciated our contributions in predicting protein fragment binding modes. The major point the reviewers raise is uncertainty about how MSAs were treated in making the FragFold predictions. We now address this and several other points alongside extensive additions to this paper, including new high-throughput experimental data supporting the computationally predicted fragment binding models. Here we summarize our responses and changes in this revised manuscript, now available as Version 2 on bioRxiv . Throughout, we use bold text blocks to indicate our responses, and italic text blocks to indicate reviewer comments. From introductory comments and reviewers’ major point 1: The major strength of this paper is in developing a method that could be used to identify regions of proteins that are involved in PPI's based on evolutionarily related sequences that recapitulate the native binding interfaces. The major weakness of this paper is that the underlying method of MSA concatenation is not clearly explained (see Major point 1). Why is the discontinuous unpaired strategy optimal relative to other AlphaFold-multimer-like strategies? Overall, the paper demonstrates the power of AlphaFold to closely recapitulate the structures of experimentally determined fragment binding interfaces by working exclusively in sequence space in a high-throughput manner. Further, in the absence of experimental structures, the authors present plausible AlphaFold predictions of fragment bound structures that are supported by biochemical and genetic data which could further contribute to the utility of this method in studying known PPI's. Major points: 1) The authors state that they generated multiple sequence alignments for both the fragments and target protein prior to running AlphaFold2 to minimize computation time. Although it is not clearly explained, the authors claim they concatenated these two MSA's into a single MSA. We interpret this to mean that the input MSA's were not directly pairing the fragment sequences to the target sequences but leaving either side of the fragment sequence and the target sequence blank to force AlphaFold to co-predict the structure of the fragment with the target protein by treating it as a single discontinuous sequence. While we were surprised by the simplicity of this method and the ability to remain in sequence space based on evolutionary similarity of fragment and target protein sequences, there are several questions we have regarding this implementation From the explanation provided with figure 1A, the fragment sequence appears to be directly paired to the target sequence, however in fig 1B the method appears to work by using the evolutionary information of many orthologs and related proteins of both fragment and target to co-predict their structures using a discontinuous input sequence. Is this correct? Could the authors provide a clearer description of how they are concatenating the MSA's? We were also curious to know how different concatenation strategies affect the accuracy of predictions. For example, could the authors also try concatenating directly paired fragment-target sequences from the same species of origin (or even try this as a single continuous sequence)? If the sequences are continuous, does adding linker regions between the fragment and target alter the results? Does the order of concatenation affect the results (concatenating from the N or C-termini of the target?). We thank the reviewers for pointing out this potential point of confusion in our methodology. We have now revised the description of our methods in the Results, Figure 1, and the Materials and Methods to clarify what was done. No novel methods of MSA concatenation were developed in this work. Rather, protein-peptide binding predictions were run using the established approach natively implemented in the ColabFold version of AlphaFold2, in which multiple polypeptides are explicitly modeled as separate chains (Mirdita et al. , Nature Methods 2022). Likewise, multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of the separate protein partners (i.e., fragment and target protein) were concatenated, a standard input for ColabFold required for predicting interactions between multiple polypeptide chains. MSAs were concatenated in a strictly row-wise, unpaired fashion. Crucially, we note that while the MSAs are concatenated (as required by ColabFold), the sequences of the protein fragment and full-length protein polypeptide chains are distinct and not connected. The strictly row-wise concatenation performed here means that in principle the order of concatenation should not matter for these predictions. We do not claim in this work that unpaired MSAs necessarily have better performance than paired MSAs (which we did not test). Rather, we deliberately used unpaired MSAs to avoid co-evolutionary signals of full-length protein-protein interactions being used in the prediction of protein-fragment interactions. As we report in the manuscript, we find that the performance with unpaired MSAs and multiple chains modeled in AlphaFold2 with monomer weights is very good, with protein-fragment interactions predicted well without the model having been trained on multi-protein complexes (only single chains) and not using multi-chain MSA pairing. All of the above clarifications have now been added to the revised manuscript. 2) In Figure 2A, the peaks indicating inhibitory activity correlate positively with the observed peaks in calculated weighted N_contacts, which forms the basis for all inferences. However, the data reveals an interesting observation in the initial segment of the protein fragment (0 to 100 aa) that while there is a peak indicating predicted binding by the AlphaFold model, there is no corresponding inhibitory activity observed for the protein in that region. Any comments on this discrepancy? In the revised manuscript, we now discuss the predicted fragment binding peak centered around residue 60 of FtsZ, which lacks corresponding inhibitory activity in our high-throughput in vivo experiments. As we describe, this region maps to a region of the protein involved in filament formation and predicted to bind in a native-like manner by FragFold. However, this same region of the full-length protein was found to exhibit a high B-factor in previous crystallographic characterization of the binding interface, suggesting it contributes little to the binding energy (Schumacher et al. , Acta Cryst F 2020). We therefore note that this example peak represents a case of a plausible predicted binder which does not inhibit the parental full-length protein interaction. 3) The authors introduce (f_native,pairwise) and (f_native,binding) to quantify similarities between experimentally solved structures and AlphaFold2 models. We found the explanation of these metrics to be confusing, one refers to the fragment and the target site but the other refers to the native binding site bound by the fragment. Is one referring to the contacts made in the experimental structure and the other the contacts in the AlphaFold model? Further clarification of what these precisely correspond to would be helpful for discerning the similarities and differences between the two. Thanks to the reviewers for noting this opportunity to provide increased clarity. In the revised manuscript, we now clarify these terms at the time they are introduced. (These terms reflect, respectively, the fraction of pairwise fragment-protein contacts from experimental full-length (native) protein-protein interaction structures predicted by FragFold; and the fraction of target protein residues from the native, experimentally determined interaction mode predicted by FragFold to be bound by any fragment residue.) 4) In both figures 2 and 3 the authors show structures of the experimentally solved complexes and the predicted AlphaFold models side by side. We were curious to know whether the AlphaFold models were able to recapitulate the sidechain conformations. In addition we were also curious to know whether the AlphaFold model recapitulated any key contacts made between the binding site and the fragment (ex: salt bridges, electrostatic interactions between charged amino acids, pi-pi stacks, hydrogen bonds between sidechains). A full investigation of the quality of sidechain conformation predictions made by AlphaFold is beyond the scope of this work and has been previously considered by others (e.g., Karelina, Noh, and Dror, eLife 2023; Jumper et al. , Nature 2021). In prior work the root-mean squared deviation (RMSD) of all non-hydrogen atoms (including sidechains) between experimental structures and AlphaFold2 models was generally found to be low (e.g., median RMSD of 2.9 Å; Karelina, Noh, and Dror, eLife 2023) but not necessarily sufficient for docking small molecules as well as enabled by experimental structures. Although sidechain conformations were not a focus of our study – and we do not compare in detail between predicted and native structures – we do now provide several predicted protein-fragment binding mode structures including sidechains, comparing FragFold models to FragFold models relaxed with the Rosetta energy function (see new Figure S8). We find that in the predicted structures, details including sidechain orientations and hydrogen bonding patterns at interfaces tend not to change substantially upon Rosetta relaxation,  suggesting that the predicted binding modes are physically and biochemically reasonable (see also the section on further additions to the manuscript, below). 5) The authors explain their use of tiling to generate inhibitory fragments and that overlapping fragments generate greater predicted binding peaks. Have the authors attempted to use smaller fragments in their program (i.e. what is the smallest fragment size that AlphaFold can still predict to be correctly binding?). We are curious to know if effects vary by changing the fragment sizes. Further, can this method be expanded upon to study multiple different fragments that bind to different sites on the target protein simultaneously? We thank the reviewers for raising these interesting ideas. Here the reviewers point out several directions we are excited to pursue in future studies but that are outside of the scope of the current work. We focused on 30-amino acid fragments for all proteins except for LptG, because based on experimental data (Savinov, Swanson, and Fields, PNAS 2022) this fragment length tended to give the best signal-to-noise and specificity of inhibitory effects in these experiments. That said, for the case of LptG, both the experimental data and our FragFold predictions reported in this manuscript were for fragments of 14 amino acids, and we were successful in predicting inhibitory peaks at this fragment length. This result illustrates that the binding modes of fragments as short as 14 amino acids are capable of being predicted by FragFold, and we too are curious how far this finding generalizes, and whether even shorter fragments will still yield comparable results. The reviewers also raise an interesting idea regarding modeling multiple binding fragments simultaneously. While our goals in this work were to model single fragments, allowing direct comparison to our high-throughput experimental data in cells (where each cell expresses a single protein fragment), in the future modeling multiple fragments should allow prediction of synergistic inhibitors, which is a promising direction for designing superior inhibitory peptides, e.g., with multiple binding fragments connected by peptide linkers. Minor points: 1) The orange and yellow lines used to show contacts between the fragment and target are difficult to distinguish from each other. Consider a different set of colors? 2) Figure 4C+E. The use of black in the model makes it difficult to distinguish the sidechains and interactions with the fragment. We believe both of these issues were related to lower-resolution figures in the initial bioRxiv submission. The revised manuscript both includes higher-resolution figures, and in several cases larger figures, allowing for small details including contact lines and sidechain interactions to come through more clearly. A brief summary of further additions to the revised manuscript: In addition to our responses to the comments from San Felipe, Bajaj, and Fraser as summarized above, we herein provide a brief highlight of other changes and additions to the revised manuscript: •	We now include extensive experimental deep mutational scanning (DMS) data on several inhibitory protein fragments. These data reveal mutations that yield further improved inhibitory protein fragments, with implications for designing peptide-based therapeutics. The DMS data also provide systematic experimental support for the FragFold-predicted fragment binding modes, including for the novel binding modes predicted for the C-terminal fragment of FtsZ. •	We perform an analysis of predicted fragment binding energy with Rosetta to show that the predicted fragment binding modes are physically plausible and broadly consistent with those seen for known peptide binders with experimentally-determined structures. Furthermore, relaxation of FragFold predicted structures using the Rosetta force field does not substantially change the binding conformations or binding energies, suggesting the binding modes directly predicted by AlphaFold are reasonable without further adjustment. •	We perform additional extensive FragFold predictions against non-cognate protein partners to further demonstrate prediction specificity. •	We compare the performance of FragFold with an alternative approach, the Rosetta-based Peptiderive protocol.",2024-09-23T18:54:22,andrew_savinov,Andrew Savinov,10.1101/2023.12.19.572389,High-throughput computational discovery of inhibitory protein fragments with AlphaFold,"Andrew Savinov, Sebastian Swanson, Amy E.

The central premise of the paper is to use a yeast selection based around the oligmerizaton/aggregation of Sup35 fused to a peptide (in this case abeta) as a proxy for amyloid forming potential. This is cool information on its own and the experimental analysis and computational framework for linking to energies is top notch. The point of using double mutants to enhance the dynamic range is very well explained and will solidify their approach to impactfully link DMS experiments to thermodynamic concepts. The major framing of the paper revolves around an analytical protein folding/engineering concept of phi-values that highlights energetic differences in the importance of interactions for forming the transition state vs. the ground state. For the textual interpretation of the results, one must buy into the energetic effects of the Sup35 system as a readout of the transition state (and secondarily for FoldX calculations on various PDBs of abeta polymorphs to be a readout of the ground state). The major issue is that an alternative (and perhaps simpler) explanation is that mutations in APR2 are more disruptive to the Sup35 oligomerization process in the screen and that this reflects amyloid/oligomerization propensities and not strictly TS of initial nucleation. The data from previous studies that is used to draw correlations to justify their interpretation around the TS is buried in extended data figures and is a bit all over the place, especially the deconvolution of primary vs. secondary nucleation. The existence of multiple polymorphs in human cells (and populations), which may or may not have related transition states - and the exact conformational requirements of the Sup35 activation mechanism - further complicate this interpretation. In summary - this contains amazing data, but I do not see the language of the interpretations lining up with the strength of the _specificity_ of the claims about the transition state.  A fuller discussion of the limitations of the prior low throughput assays that are referenced in extended data 1 and 2 and detailed kinetic characterization of some of the more surprising mutants in a biochemically defined system would greatly improve the match between the data and the claims. These issues should not stop others from building on this beautiful work - but in doing so, other investigators should note that there remains ambiguity as to whether the effects are truly on the TS or on the ground state.

This is not true, so it's appropriate to respond here. Both commenters note that low p-values for relative risk maps (Figure 2 and Figure 4) require sufficient sampling density to obtain a low p-value. Of course, this is correct. Both commenters argue that this is misleading. I disagree. No co-author, peer reviewer, or editor involved was misled. News articles on the paper thus far have almost all portrayed the data and analysis accurately. We do not argue in the paper that SARS-CoV-2 could not have been found in places that were not sampled; I'm unaware of anyone making this argument based on our paper; it's not misleading if no one is misled. On top of this, the proportion of positive samples in each location is displayed along with the relative risk p-value. The n=1/1 sample that Bahry complains ""shows little heat"" is clearly indicated as a sampled location with high positivity in Fig 2A. And the underlying data is available in supplementary figures and tables. It's demonstratively not misleading. The other arguments the two commenters make consist of (1) arguing against a different paper published years ago, (2) a demand for a citation of an irrelevant paper, (3) arguing for an alternative analysis method without demonstrating that it would have more statistical power, (4) an argument that implicitly assumes all expectations for all coronaviruses are identical regardless of their hosts and modes of transmission, and lastly (5) a typo in a citation.

Given the history of the Iberian peninsula, would it not be more plausible to attribute such lineages to the Alans? Sarmatians carried Y-chromosome haplogroup Q-L332, and there seem to be a decent amount of Spaniards and Portuguese which carry Sarmatian-related lineages to this day. Perhaps the R1a-Z94 lineage could also be there through Sarmatians but it would depend on the subclade, as R-Z94 is over 4000 years old and was carried by various peoples - mostly of Indo-Iranian origin however. If there were any sources used regarding the Jewish origin of Q-L332 in the Iberian peninsula or perhaps archaeological signs which affirm the Jewish origin of sample PT_23227, I would be interested to have a look.

(2024) identified a physical interaction between ERC1 and ATG8e, leading them to explore potential ATG8-interaction motifs (AIMs) in ERC1. Using the iLIR database (Jacomin et al., 2016) for AIM prediction, they found the results irrelevant to the ERC1-ATG8e interaction, indicating a false prediction. Through truncated ERC1 variants, they identified a non-canonical AIM undetectable by current prediction tools, which focus on the canonical [W/F/Y]-[X]-[X]-[L/I/V] sequence. They validated this motif with AlphaFold2-multimer (AFM), a method we previously demonstrated (Ibrahim et al., 2023) to accurately predict non-canonical AIMs, as shown with ATG3.

Obviously there are informative samples in the world that weren't sequenced and there is sequencing data that hasn't been published. An identity vs sampling date plot would be limited to samples that were later published and would be out of date in a couple months. More importantly, I don't see any value in the impossible counterfactual of what we would know if sequences that were eventually published had instead been instantaneously sequenced and published on their sampling date. Of course, the answer is: ""we would know what we knew eventually, but earlier."" But that's also the answer if sampling followed by sequencing and publication was more frequent regardless of the rates of the different steps. Figure 2 in this paper clearly shows the value of adding data, especially before the spotlight shines on a virus like it did in 2020 and triggers sequencing of retrospective samples. This is important, because several of the data points in Figure 2 correspond to samples that have had the scientists who collected and sequenced samples and published the sequences targeted with conspiracy theories. This disincentivizes rapid publication of data. For example, the mid-2021 data point for RaTG15 prompted a letter to one of the authors of the corresponding publication with a weirdly inaccurate argument that an early-2020 data point for RaTG13 is inauthentic. The letter says ""it has not been possible to assemble the RaTG13 genome sequence"" while linking to a Virological.org post in which everyone who tries succeeds at assembling the RaTG13 genome sequence.

There has been an ongoing debate over whether DJ-1 acts directly on MG (direct substrate) or requires a protein intermediate acting as a protein/nucleic acid deglycase (glycated protein substrate). The authors used fixed-target micro-crystallography and mix-and-inject serial crystallography to structurally analyze covalent intermediates in the reaction catalyzed by DJ-1. One of the significant achievements of the study is the successful use of these advanced crystallography methods to determine the structure of key reaction intermediates: hemithioacetal and L-lactoylcysteine, providing new insights into DJ-1's glyoxalase mechanism. However, a major weakness is that the authors' claim refuting the alternative deglycase mechanism are not fully supported by the presented data. Despite this limitation, the study advances our understanding of DJ-1’s enzymatic function by leveraging MISC at synchrotron using the new flow cell injector. Major points Major point 1 The claim made in the discussion that: “These results provide direct structural evidence supporting a growing number of enzymology studies also indicating that DJ-1 is not a deglycase…” is not supported by evidence presented in the manuscript. Although this work elegantly demonstrates that MG covalently modifies the catalytic cysteine of DJ-1 (Cys106), the crystallography experiments presented are unable to test whether the alternative mechanism (with a glycated substrate) occurs. More careful treatment of this logic in the discussion would strengthen the manuscript, and would help the manuscript to be more focused on the compelling X-ray crystallography results. We recognize it is difficult to “prove a negative” however these experiments affirm the primary activity without directly testing the alternative one. Major point 2 The authors report compelling evidence that the DJ-1 catalytic cysteine (Cys106) is covalently modified by MG. However, the concentration of MG used was 50 mM, and non-catalytic cysteines might be covalently modified at this concentration. Indeed, it’s possible that one of the DJ-1 surface cysteines is covalently modified (Cys53), based on the large positive difference peak in the FO-FO difference density (Figure 5b, Figure S8) (although it is suggested that this is evidence of allosteric communication). Covalent modification of a surface cysteine leading to lattice disruption is consistent with the observation that MG is known to dissolve DJ-1 crystals. The manuscript could be strengthened by consideration of these points, as well as analysis of difference maps around Cys53 for the fixed target structure (e.g. add panel to Figure S1 showing FO(methylglyoxal)-FO(free) maps around Cys53). Discussion of the differences in modification rates for the catalytic and surface cysteines, and the impact of large versus small crystals, would be helpful. Major point 3 Is it plausible that a second, synchronized turnover is captured by the mix-and-inject experiment? This claim might be developed by modeling the concentration profile of the intermediates along the 30 second time course (e.g. similar to Figure 4 in PMID 29848358). To this point, were the occupancies of the covalent adducts refined at each time point? Did the authors consider whether a mixture of species might be present? The evidence supporting the second turnover comes from the featureless difference map calculated between the 3 sec and 20 sec time points (FO(20s)-FO(3s) in Figure S6). Is there an alternative explanation for the decreased occupancy at this time point other than synchronized turnover? E.g. a problem with sample mixing resulting in lower substrate concentration at this time point. A related concern is whether the data as presented can discriminate between the two covalent intermediates (HTA or LC). Perhaps Figure S7 would be strengthened by adding the FO-FC difference maps for each of the intermediates modeled with the other species (e.g. the HTA dataset modeled with LC and vice versa). Can the authors comment on the lack of correlated negative (or positive) density in the FO-FO difference map matrix (Figure S5) in panels comparing sp2 and sp3 carbons (e.g. FO(15s)-FO(3s)). In this example, there is a large positive peak in the difference map for the sp2 to sp3 change, but no correlated negative peak. Minor points Minor point 1 Was the covalent adduct observed in the MG-soaked DJ-1 crystals presented in Figure S1c modeled? Is the difference density consistent with the HTA or LC intermediates? Or a mixture of both? Minor point 2 Is it possible that movement of the active site histidine (His126) away from covalent intermediate (Figure 4a) is consistent with histidine protonation? Or is the geometry such that protonation is unlikely? Minor point 3 We find it helpful if the figure (or figure legend) includes PDB codes for their quick look up. Minor point 4 The size of the scale bar in Figure S1a might be increased. Review by: Pooja Asthana, Galen J. Correy & James S.
