This has an advantage over using detergents such as CHAPSO, because the target protein concentration can remain lower. It seems like this would be a straightforward method to implement for challenging specimens and therefore should be of broad interest. We would find it helpful if the authors could provide more methodological detail in the manuscript, especially given it is a methods-based paper. For example, when was LEA added to the samples? What concentration was the stock solution of LEA? Is glycerol necessary for LEA protein stability? The manuscript would be strengthened by investigation into the mechanistic basis of how LEA proteins improve particle quality. The authors hypothesize that LEA coats the air-water interface and could further investigate this. The orientation bias of the samples in this study suggests that the sample proteins are still interacting with an interface. Tomography could help explain these. It would also be interesting to know if the authors attempted to reconstruct crosslinked PRC2 in the absence of LEA (as a control, instead of comparing to other laboratories' work).",2024-04-12T16:25:56,lori_passmore,Lori Passmore,10.1101/2024.02.06.579238,Small LEA proteins as an effective air-water interface protectant for fragile samples during cryo-EM grid plunge freezing,"Kaitlyn M.

Introduction and Abstract: Strengths: - good summary of current work in the field, well motivated Potential improvement: -Could be more clear to introduce cell migration first then explain the impact of the ECM on these processes which is a smoother lead in to the research question. Right now it jumps from ECM to migration back to ECM and reads as choppy and disjointed. Methodology: Strengths: -Thorough throughout, providing replicable description of the work , culturing, and data analysis Potential Improvement: -We wanted the same level of detail in the experimental methods as was given in the cell culture. Results: Strengths: -Easy to follow. Great figures, well organized. Potential Improvements: -We suggest moving figure 1a-b to a separate figure. -It would be more useful to consider cell averages across more replicates. Some experiments only had N=1 biological replicates, which we only found in the legends - these would be appreciated on the figures themselves in cases where we were comparing between groups (figure 3a control and b2-KO, e.g.). -Sufficient replicates were not always performed to make robust statistical comparisons. Conclusions: Strengths: -explained why they did what they did -compared their work to previous work -nice summary flow (first sentence is what was their goal, followed by some background, etc,) Potential Improvement: -would help clarity to refer to their own figures in the conclusions.

Indeed, the correct interpretation is that the enrichment-based methods allow inter- and not intra- sample comparison. A very nice explanation is from Nadel et all 2021 quoted here ""Also included in this study are four signature quantification tools, which include DCQ, MCP-Counter, SaVanT and xCell [9, 11, 12, 27]. These tools operate by calculating scores intended to correspond to the relative abundance of each cell type across samples. These scores should not be interpreted as fractions and are, in fact, often unbounded and sum to values >1.0. Although scores for a particular cell type can be compared across samples, comparisons of scores across cell types may not be valid. For example, a sample with a higher score for B cells compared with natural killer (NK) cells does not imply that there are more B cells than NK cells present. The tools MCP-Counter and SaVanT generate signature scores by calculating the log-sum of a set of marker genes [11, 27].""",2024-04-10T11:27:08,disqus_j8HB2aFhOJ,Anna Vathrakokoili Pournara,10.1101/2023.01.19.523443,CATD: A reproducible pipeline for selecting cell-type deconvolution methods across tissues,"Anna Vathrakokoili Pournara, Zhichao Miao, Ozgur Yilmaz Beker, Nadja Nolte, Alvis Brazma, Irene Papatheodorou",2023-11-07

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.11.584392v1#comment-6431953574,biorxivstage,0,"We want to congratulate the authors for this manuscript addressing what we think is a very interesting and relevant topic. The dataset is impressive, the methods are outstanding, and the results are robust and relevant. However, in our opinion, the manuscript does not fully clarify whether environmental similarity between relatives affects phenotypic heritability versus phenotypic heritability estimates of the animal model. This clarification is crucial for interpretation of the results obtained by anyone fitting similar models. In other words, are the estimates after accounting for environmental similarity the 'correct' values for the trait’s heritability (implying that otherwise, they would be overestimated, and environmental similarity only affects heritability estimates but not heritability per se)? Or, when accounting for environmental similarity, do heritability estimates reflect the heritability after controlling for environmental inheritance (i.e., environmental similarity does affect heritability and its effects are statically removed when fitted in the model, resulting in an underestimation of total heritability)? We believe that this topic could be better addressed, by referring to recent theoretical work presented in Munar-Delgado et al. 2023 ( https://doi.org/10.1111/204.... Here we showed how heritability is affected by environmental similarity only when the environment itself is somehow inherited and affects the phenotypic trait via phenotypic plasticity. In such a scenario, the total heritability of the trait is the sum of the direct heritability (the inherited basis for the phenotypic trait) plus the indirect heritability (the direct inherited basis for the focal environment, proportional to the square of the strength of phenotypic plasticity). Thus, accounting for environmental similarity in the animal model statically removes those indirect effects. Both heritability estimates (when not accounting for environmental similarity and when doing so) are statistically 'correct' (unbiased) estimates. However, they do reflect different things biologically, and not considering this can bias their interpretation. As a side note, we think that the effect of environmental inheritance on the heritability of the phenotypic trait has the same outcome when the environment is genetically inherited (in the ms mentioned as ""If it results from a genetically mediated breeding environment choice, then this could actually be considered part of the 'genetic' heritability of the trait"") and when it is non-genetically inherited (in the ms mentioned as ""by assuming similarity in the environments used by individuals is driven purely by non-genetic""). Animal models estimate the proportion of the variation in the phenotype transmitted across generations. This variation can be both genetically and non-genetically transmitted. In this context, it might be helpful to talk about 'inclusive heritability' (Danchin and Wagner, 2010 - https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1... when referring to the heritability potentially affected by environmental similarity, which can be both genetically and non-genetically inherited (this includes environmental inheritance via limited dispersal). Overall, we would state that environmental similarity does increase heritability of the phenotypic trait if it is affected by a heritable environment (unlike the title of the ms that states that it decreases heritability). Once again, congratulations on your work, and we are happy to discuss this further if you wish.

A group of student editors synthesized the individual reviews into this PreReview. We hope that the authors and readers of this paper will find our comments useful! Introduction The paper, “Complete chromosome 21 centromere sequences from a Down syndrome family reveal size asymmetry and differences in kinetochore attachment,” delves into the role of centromere structure and epigenetic features of chromosome 21 (chr21) in contributing to Trisomy 21 (T21). Trisomy 21, clinically known as Down syndrome, is the most common autosomal chromosomal aneuploidy in humans, which is caused by the presence of an entire extra chromosome 21 in the affected individual. While there are multiple ways this syndrome can be inherited, the most common path is a nondisjunction of chromosomes during maternal meiosis I (MI) due to an error in segregation of chromosomes. Centromeres are crucial for the correct segregation of chromosomes during meiosis; thus, understanding their role and how their characteristics might contribute to nondisjunction of chromosome 21 is a current gap in knowledge. The authors hypothesized that genetic and epigenetic variation at the centromere of chromosome 21 can act as risk factors for chromosome 21 nondisjunction. Previously, centromeres sequences were inaccessible using short-read sequencing technologies. To overcome this limitation, the authors employed a variety of sequencing methods including Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) high-fidelity (HiFi) long read sequencing and ultra-long Oxford Nanopore Technologies (UL-ONT) along with ChIP-seq. Utilizing these technologies, the team sequenced and assembled centromeres from a parent-child trio, where the child, diagnosed with Down syndrome, exhibits three distinct chromosome 21 centromere haplotypes with significant size differences. Finally, the centromere variations in the T21 family were compared to a population sampling of 35 completely sequenced chromosome 21 centromeres from diverse ancestry, which revealed unique features of T21 centromeres, especially size asymmetry and epigenetic differences. The authors concluded that these findings suggest an impairment in the kinetochore formation that can lead to nondisjunction and T21; therefore, providing insights into Down syndrome’s molecular mechanism and emphasizing the importance of centromeric structure in chromosomal stability. Main Limitations The authors acknowledged several major limitations of the study, including the sampling of only one proband-parent trio and the exclusive use of transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines. Here, we elaborate on the significance of these limitations and introduce additional limitations for consideration by the authors. 1)	The sequencing of only one parent-proband trio is a major limitation of the study, given the heterogeneity in higher order repeat (HOR) array length and centromere dip region (CDR) methylation pattern found among the 35 previously assembled chromosome 21 centromeres. Although the results did show that the HOR array of one of the proband's maternally inherited chromosomes was significantly shorter than any HOR array from the control human population, it still cannot be assumed from one parent-child trio that this unusually short length or asymmetry in the mother increases the risk of nondisjunction and trisomy 21. The paternal sequencing data also showed centromere asymmetry, to a lesser extent than that of the mother, and without data from more trios, we are still left with the question of whether paternal asymmetry can also contribute to nondisjunction risk. Furthermore, some individuals, such as HG03710 in Figure 3C, also exhibit centromere HOR asymmetry and differential CDR methylation patterns across chromosome 21 centromere haplotypes. Thus, with the current data, it is difficult to distinguish between normal variation and variation associated with trisomy 21. Sampling only one trio is accompanied by yet another limitation specific to trisomy 21 – the mother’s age at conception was 29, which is not representative of the increased risk of trisomy 21 at maternal ages greater than 35. Finally, the of sampling only one trio, while very informative of the most common type of meiotic error leading to trisomy 21 (meiosis I, maternal), does not necessarily explain the mechanism by which other meiotic errors lead to trisomy 21. To make a well-supported conclusion about what genetic factors confer risk for trisomy 21, more parent-child trios would need to be analyzed. While we acknowledge the costs of long-read sequencing and the resources needed to carry it out, obtaining the sequencing data of just one or two additional trios could potentially provide more confidence that these epigenetic differences and asymmetry are conserved across cases of trisomy 21 and contribute to nondisjunction. 2)	The authors of the study extracted DNA from transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines rather than primary tissue material collected from the individuals. There is currently limited evidence on the genomic and epigenomic stability of these cells at the centromere. Repeating the analysis on DNA taken from primary culture, if possible, could bring certainty to the fact that the observed genetic and epigenetic features are associated with nondisjunction/trisomy 21, and not with the EBV transformation of these cells, for example. A broader analysis across cell types in the future could also remove epigenetic differences between cell lines as confounding variables. 3)	While the authors extensively characterized the centromeres of chromosome 21 in one case of trisomy 21 and identified variations in size, methylation patterns, and CENP-A enrichment, they did not directly demonstrate the functional significance of these differences in promoting chromosome 21 nondisjunction. To address this limitation, the authors could perform functional assays using cell lines or animal models to assess the impact of altered centromere structure and epigenetics on chromosome segregation and the occurrence of trisomy 21. These additional experiments would strengthen the study's conclusions and provide deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying trisomy 21. However, we understand that these kinds of functional experiments may not be the focus of the research group that carried out the study, and other research groups or collaborators may choose to complement their findings with functional experiments. 4)	Although the title of the paper claims that the sequencing of the chromosome 21 centromeres revealed “differences in kinetochore attachment”, there is no functional evidence of differences in kinetochore attachment provided in the paper. At several points throughout the manuscript the authors use more speculative language to refer to what can be gleaned about the kinetochore from their epigenetic results. For example, in the abstract: “these epigenetic signatures suggest less competent kinetochore attachment” and when referring to the CDR on p. 5, “the likely site of kinetochore attachment”, or on p. 7 “ thought to define the site of kinetochore attachment”. We recommend that the authors either remove this from the title, incorporate uncertainty into the title, or add additional experiments to the paper that would provide evidence for differences in kinetochore attachment. For example, ChIP-seq for other kinetochore proteins could bolster this claim. Minor Limitations While the paper mentioned several major limitations, there are also some minor limitations that we found relevant to the paper.  Minor limitations include recommendations for improved clarity and figure presentation. 1)	A brief statement elucidating the significance of the AluY retrotransposon insertion highlighted in the text would add clarity to its relevance. 2)	Furnishing more details about the controls, such as their geographic origin and diversity, would strengthen the study. We infer that the abbreviations in parenthesis next to the sample names in figure 4 refers to ancestry information, but it would be helpful to add these abbreviations in the figure legend. 3)	 The large size of the pedigree in Figure 1 made it challenging to discern the epigenetic profiles and heatmaps due to their small size; enlarging these elements or providing clearer delineation could address this issue. 4)	Integrating portions of supplemental figures 2 and 5, which compare the proband to the parents, as additional panels in the main figures, would emphasize differences in methylation patterns and CDR more effectively. 5)	Figures featuring numerous colors or intricate details, such as figures 2 and 3, could benefit from additional textual labeling or zooming in on key regions of interest to enhance comprehension. It would have been beneficial to strengthen the evolutionary significance portion of their article. Centromeres are complex genomic regions subject to unique evolutionary forces, including concerted evolution, which can lead to rapid turnover and homogenization of repetitive sequences. The evolutionary history of α-satellite HORs may involve intricate processes that are not fully captured by sequence divergence analyses alone. Without additional comparative genomic analyses or experimental validation, it is challenging to accurately infer the evolutionary age of specific α-satellite HORs. While sequence divergence can provide insights into the evolutionary history of genomic regions, it may not always accurately reflect the age of a particular sequence due to factors such as selective pressures, genetic drift, and genomic rearrangements. Therefore, relying solely on sequence identity plots to infer evolutionary age may oversimplify the evolutionary dynamics of α-satellite HORs. 6)	In the methods, the authors state that the proband had a mosaic karyotype, and provide the same karyotype information that is given on the Coriell repository website for the cell line. Did the authors perform their own validation of the karyotypes of the trio in their cell line aliquots at a passage close to what they used for their experiments? It would be useful for the authors to comment on how the 58% of cells with the translocated chromosome 21 and 22 in the proband might impact their results, if at all. Significance The paper reports significant technical advancements in the study of centromere structure and epigenetics, particularly within the context of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Utilizing long-read sequencing technology PacBio HiFi and UL-ONT, combined with ChIP-Seq, the researchers comprehensively examined centromere size and epigenetic differences, overcoming previous limitations associated with conventional methods. This approach not only facilitated the resolution of complex repetitive regions like centromeres but also enabled the integration of genetic sequencing with epigenetic profiling, providing a holistic understanding of centromere biology. In the broader context of human genetic disorders, the findings of this study offer novel insights into the role of centromere structure and function in the prevalence of Down syndrome. By highlighting the potential contribution of centromere size variability and epigenetic differences to the risk of chromosome nondisjunction, the paper opens new avenues for understanding molecular mechanisms of nondisjunction events, with implications for other aneuploidies beyond Down syndrome. Moreover, further exploration of centromere size variability and epigenetic differences could lead to advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for genetic disorders, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare practices.",2024-04-05T17:40:42,adriannasanroman,Adrianna San Roman,10.1101/2024.02.25.581464,Complete chromosome 21 centromere sequences from a Down syndrome family reveal size asymmetry and differences in kinetochore attachment,"F.

The results however are not satisfactory to this observer’s eye. Taking into account that heat maps can be deceiving ( doi.org/10.1038/s41590-021-..., looking at your Fig. 5C it seems to me that the evidence that the problem is only marginally solved is: -  SMA in lane 15 (Endo): endothelium CD31+ CD14- VIM+ should be SMA-, while you do not have SMA in the stromal clusters, where it should be. - Macrophages (lane 14) are generally CD20-, except for signal bleeding from adjacent C B cells. And, for what is worth a heat map, CD4 signs should be stronger than CD3. - CD8 vanished Your “PD1+ B cells” are probably TCF1+ CD3+ CD4+ T follicular helper cells. As per the smart strategy to use of a plausibility score from a priori knowledge, the only example I do know of usable markers are PAX5 for B cells, CD3 and CD8 for T cells and CD163 for macrophages. Maybe one can add CD14, although it has been described on cDC2 and B1 cells. Everything else is shared by more than one cell type (experience on ~80 markers). CD68 is Macs + pDC, your CD68 clone, KP1, labels also neutrophils, CD20 is on some T cells, CD31 abundantly labels Macs, etc. etc. As per your table S1, CD31 labels T cells (doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02434 ), CD20 and CD68 mutual exclusivity is emptied by your cluster 14 data. Plausibility score should therefore be based on maybe 3-4 hypothetical mutual exclusion. But dimensionality reduction algorithms are much better at that. I believe that the problem is somewhere else in the analytical pipeline: data processing. We developed a pipeline, BRAQUE (Dall’Olio, L.; Bolognesi, M.; Borghesi, S.; Cattoretti, G.; Castellani, G.

Entropy 2023, 25, 354. https://doi.org/10.3390/e25... in which data pre-processing has a major effect in separating clusters, to be further classified. We found (ms in preparation) that endothelial cells can effortlessly be separated from SMA+ fibroblasts. The “doublets” of CD4 and CD8 are minimized (see Table 2). All this without any of the processing you developed with STARLING. Imagine by combining BRAQUE with STARLING! Our data are available in the public domain and can be shared for a focused collaboration. While I do congratulate for the effort and long-standing work in the field, I hope that my observations will further improve the experience in the field.

I've been working on the cultural dimension for some time now and I have reached the conclusion that what is needed is a transition from the growth imperative to the balance imperative. This accords with the panarchy cycle in terms of shifting from the growth stage to the conservation phase. https://passel2.unl.edu/vie.... It accords with the necessary transition from a r-selected strategy to a k-selected strategy. It accords with the maximum power principle in that the goal of evolutionary system design is to optimise the balance between the rate of energy transfer with efficiency of energy transfer which means optimising the balance between force functions, resilience functions, adaptability functions and reproductive functions. In other words, maximising survival potential. https://www.ecologycenter.u... Finally the transition from the growth imperative to the balance imperative accords with the need for the human species to balance with Earth systems and in particular balance human activity with the natural carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and water cycles to ensure healthy and resilient functioning of these cycles. It is of course, natural cycle disequilibrium that typifies human ecological overshoot with the exponential growth of high entropy waste associated with an exponentially growing human abiotic environment which cannot be assimilated naturally by nonhuman biotic and abiotic systems. Therefore I propose that the Post Growth cultural revolution be predicated on the balance imperative with the understanding that nonhuman associated ecological growth needs to be balanced with the human biotic and abiotic enterprise. And that this is a zero sum game between the k-selected strategy and the current r-selected strategy. I think the meme of 'Post Growth' is more relevant than the meme of Degrowth although degrowth can be seen as sub category of Post Growth. I think Post Growth is more relevant because it better describes what is actually occurring within the panarchy cycle and is therefore more relatable in terms of public education and public discourse in terms of explaining actually existing dynamics regarding human societies hitting per capita limits to economic abiotic growth and human societies hitting per capita ecological carrying capacity limits. I would suggest limits to economic growth is indelibly linked to breaching carrying capacity limits but further research is needed to qualify that. This hypothesis suggests that capitalism is responsive to both ecological scarcity and ecological carrying capacity breaches through the price mechanism and should be considered as part of the suite of educational tools to inform the public exactly what is going on beyond the false growth narrative being disseminated by politicians, think tanks, the media and business leaders. Similarly, the capitalist state system does have resilience mechanisms by which economic contraction can be absorbed to some degree. I feel we need to utilise these systems rather than throw the baby out with the bath water. By educating the public at the same time as leaning on the resilience functions embedded within the state capitalist system, we can help coordinate temporary and long lasting solutions to permanent per capita economic contraction by rerouting energy and material throughput as necessary. Therefore rather than a solely bottom up approach, I think we also need to utilise current top down systems to facilitate bottom up participatory approaches in order to try and create a win win mutualist strategy. This would include allowing maladaptive state capitalist functions to perish. Thus rather than using post growth dynamics to reject the state capitalist system which I think will make our shared future even more daunting, I suggest we use the state capitalist system to provide ourselves with buffers to deliberate on the next steps. This would include devising remedial solutions as different parts of the state capitalist system collapses. This means a more gradualist contraction strategy whereby we rationally respond to the changes that are being indicated by the state capitalist system which as I argued above is probably in sync with ecological scarcity and carrying capacity limits via the invisible hand of the market. This isn't to say that part of the cultural revolution from the growth imperative to the balance imperative is to try and make capitalism more sustainable. It is to recognise that capitalism itself emerged as a bottom up strategy from its mercantile roots and that we can now activate the emergence of another bottom up system from the roots of the capitalist system. #BalancenotGrowth #OnePlanetLiving",2024-04-04T17:09:33,stevegwynne,Steve Gwynne,10.1101/2024.04.01.587657,Population growth poses a significant threat to forest ecosystems: a case study from the Hindukush-Himalayas of Pakistan,"Naveed Alam, Zahid Ullah, Bilal Ahmad, Ahmad Ali, Kashmala Syed",2024-04-03

However, present-day Hungarians are overwhelmingly derived from Slavic and German peasants from nearby Hungary. This is not a controversial claim on my part; it's backed up by historical sources and a wide range of genetic analyses. Hungarians still show some minor ancestry from Hungarian Conquerors (early Magyars), but this signal only reliably shows up in large surveys of Y-chromosome samples. The Scythians that you used to model the ancestry of present-day Hungarians are of local, Pannonian origin, and they don't show any eastern nomad ancestry. So they're either acculturated Scythians, or, more likely, wrongly classified as Scythians by archeologists. And since these so-called Scythians lack eastern nomad ancestry, the similarity between them and present-day Hungarians is not a sign of the impact from Avars, Hungarian Conquerors and the like, but rather a lack of significant input from such groups in present-day Hungarians. I've done a rather long blog post about your analysis of Medieval Poles and present-day Hungarians at the link below.

Some comments: 1) Your abstract ends:""Here, we show that these empirical patterns all emerge from a single theory incorporating the evolution of cis and trans-acting regulators of gene expression. This theory offers a level of parsimony and generality rarely seen in biology."" But you don't say what ""THIS THEORY"" is! A vague mention of ""cis and trans-acting regulators of gene expression"" does not well encapsulate your hypothesis, if I understand it correctly. Your problem is to explain chromosome-wide effects, the effect of overall ancestry. You don't mention a key part of your theory, which is DOSAGE COMPENSATION!!! I think you should do this in the abstract. 2) You don't cite our papers, and why should you have done so? -- they came out very recently, probably after you'd done most of this work. However, I think our recent genomic mapping papers on Haldane's Rule in female heterogametic butterflies are highly relevant and provide circumstantial evidence for the chromosome-wide, polygenic effects required in your dosage-compensation hypothesis, especially on the Z chromosome. The two relevant papers are: Rosser, N., Edelman, N.B., Queste, L.M., Nelson, M., Seixas, F., Dasmahapatra, K.K., & Mallet, J. 2022. Complex basis of hybrid female sterility and Haldane's rule in Heliconius butterflies: Z-linkage and epistasis. Molecular Ecology 31:959-977. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec...

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 120:e2300959120. https://doi.org/10.1073/pna... The latter paper especially, which re-analyzes inferences made about the weird epistatic sterility effects inferred via QTL analysis  in the former paper. A quantitative  proportion of ancestry effect is a better fit, according to Xiong et al., than the single locus + (left and right end of the chromosome pairwise epistasis) proposed by Rosser et al. Of course, it was well known since Dobzhansky 1936 that hybrid sterility in Drosophila was multi-locus. See: Dobzhansky, T. 1936. Studies on hybrid sterility. II. Localization of sterility factors in Drosophila pseudoobscura hybrids. Genetics 21:113-135. https://doi.org/10.1093/gen... I think our papers suggest, or at least comport with the idea that in two distantly related pairs of butterfly species, female hybrid sterility is also mediated by multilocus effects, at least along the Z chromosome. The fraction of ancestry matters. As we wrote ""The molecular nature of polygenicity is unresolved. In our case, it is tempting to consider epigenetic mechanisms between autosomes and the Z chromosome. For instance, genetic variance of pupal weight in backcross males is much smaller than that in females (SI Appendix, Table S2). This is consistent, for instance, with dosage compensation in Lepidoptera in which both Z chromosomes in males are partially suppressed (37), which will dampen the effects of introgressed factors.""

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.27.568675v1#comment-6417484638,biorxivstage,1,"Upon reading the recent preprint titled “Dietary reconstructions of Magdalenian canids from SW-Germany do not indicate that the area was a centre of early European wolf domestication” by Bons et al. on BioRxiv, it has come to our attention that certain aspects require clarification to ensure accurate information is conveyed. First and foremost, it is essential to mention that the referenced paper has undergone a rigorous peer-review process and did not meet the acceptance criteria, resulting in its rejection. Maintaining transparency and accuracy in discussions related to the scholarly review process is imperative. In responding to the preprint, our intention is to focus on rectifying any potential misinterpretations within the content of our work. While constructive criticism and scientific discourse are vital components of academic discussion, our emphasis remains on addressing the scientific aspects rather than engaging in personal disputes. Below we address the seven main scientific criticisms of our study. 1. Why were the canids from Gnirshöhle called dogs? In our paper, we did not definitely classify the remains as dogs or wolves on purpose. We hypothesize that all Gnirshöhle canids had restricted diet and where at the beginning of the domestication process of wolves leading to dogs, which is why we have chosen the title as ""A refined proposal for the origin of dogs"". All scientific evidence points out that wolves are the wild ancestors of dogs, so addressing the origin of dogs requires that we investigate some ancient wolves. During the early steps of wolf domestication, it is expected that the first changes will take place in the behavior of some individuals within a larger wolf population and therefore, changes in the isotopic composition of canid bones will occur among individuals with similar genetic background. This is exactly what is documented in our article, as the canids were genetically like wolves at the mitochondrial level, while their diet was very specific and not comparable to the diet of other wolves from the Magdalenian. To us and the reviewers of our study, this was convincing evidence of a restrictive diet, most likely influenced by prehistoric humans, which can be interpreted as pet-keeping. This would be the first step of wolf domestication - hence the title of the article, consistent with recent scientific literature. 2. Why did we include foxes and did two large canid clusters? As Bons et al. correctly pointed out, the number of clusters can be reduced or increased. To test if the chosen number of clusters leads to a bias in the distinction between the two clusters of large canids, we made another analysis by first excluding the foxes and reducing the number of clusters to two. The result is that the large canids are divided in the same way, as in our three clusters, into two groups of large canids. Only the one wolf from Schussenquelle (SCH-11), formerly in the fox niche, joins the canids from Gnirshöhle, because of its low δ15N value. Nevertheless, the same clear difference can be seen between the large canids with high δ15N values (δ15N = 7.9 ± 0.9 ‰) and the large canids with low δ15N values (δ15N = 5.8 ± 0.3 ‰, which we have called diet-restricted canids). To separate the foxes and use them as a ‘trophic outgroup’, we decided to construct three clusters instead of two in our original article. 3. Why is comparing the isotopic variation of modern wolf hair with the isotopic variation in ancient wolf collagen invalid and misleading? Bons et al. compared our measured isotopic values in bone collagen with those of modern wolf hair from the USA. This argument is intended to show that our niche reconstruction is not valid because the intraspecific variability of the isotopes is too large to allow it. However, hair records a snapshot of individual life and therefore are subject to short-term and seasonal dietary fluctuations, leading to potentially high isotopic variability. In contrast, bone collagen records average isotope values over several years of the animal's life. Therefore, the ranges of isotopic variations of bone collagen are not comparable to those from hair. A high variability in hair isotope data comes from seasonal, regional, and other short-term and local variations, while in contrast, high variability in bone collagen can only come from different dietary preferences over a long period of time spanning over a year. Thus, isotopic variations in bone collagen were adequate to show different feeding strategies and are related to trophic behavior and niches. 4. Did the inclusion of one data point possibly from the Late Pleistocene to Holocene transition influence the interpretation? We used only isotopic data from the Magdalenian (c. 16 to 14 k yrs calBP) to calculate diet and niches, therefore prior to this environmental transition. Only one single wolf from Hohle Fels (c. 13.2 kyrs calBP) could fall into the Late Pleistocene to Holocene transition, which dated from c. 12.4 - 10.8 kyrs BP. However, this potential chronological outlier was not the subject of discussion. All the other 13 canid individuals, as well as the food resources, come from secured archaeological layers of the Magdalenian or have even been directly dated (all dates were published in our article). 5. Why did we use the TEF of foxes instead of wolves? Bons et al. questioned our decision to use the TEF values of foxes from Krajcarz et al. (2018) and not using the published wolf’s TEF values. The values calculated by Krajcarz et al. (2018) correspond to a “natural” case study, where canids have to actively forage, catch, and consume their own food, in contrast to the published wolf TEF values, calculated more indirectly. They are thus the most recently published and the closest to the reality of canid’s metabolism. The metabolism of foxes and wolves is very similar because they belong to the same taxonomic family and could feed on the same kind of prey. 6. Was essential information about our dietary reconstructions not provided, and why are the results apparently not the same as in Bons et al.? We have included all the necessary raw data in our article to allow scientists to replicate our calculations. The most important control factors for good and usable models are the Geweke and Gelman-Rubin tests. Both tests independently indicate the convergence of the model and are essential information that must be given for the models used. The chain length of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) must also be reported, as well as the number of chains and the burn-in. The reason that Bons et al. got different results from the model than we did may be that their model did not run convergently, which cannot be verified due to the lack of Geweke and Gelman-Rubin test results. 7. Did the individual age of GNI-999 as a subadult change the interpretation? According to Bons et al.’s interpretation of the CT scans of one individual, GNI-999, this is a subadult individual, which would have significantly changed our interpretation if we had included it. This is incorrect. As Bons et al. also acknowledge, this was not a young puppy, which means that the bone collagen examined was not influenced by consumption of mother’s milk. In fact, the isotopic values of subadult canids should be considered equivalent to those of an adult animal because they do not have a 15N-enriched milk signal after weaning and thus, the δ15N values of their bone collagen are not elevated. According to Geiger et al. (2016), the CT scan of GN-999 shows an age of at least four months, whereas wolves are weaned after three months (Packard 2019). Therefore, this statement does not affect our interpretation of its isotopic values. Moreover, it has also no consequences on the interpretation of the 13 other specimens of large canids considered in the paleogenetic and isotopic investigation presented in our article.

I have following comments/questions: Major: - Definitely the current state of the research suffers from insufficient validation. Please, reproduce your analysis on (Thompson, 2018); (Meer, 2018) datasets as well as other single-cell hepatocytes datasets like (Gravina, 2016.) - It is not theoretically clear how the exponent in PC-1 component is related to the one in Gompertz law. Provide more theoretical explanation as one, for example, was proposed in (Vural, 2014, Phys. Rev.) - The exponential fit to PC1 scores seems to be unreliable because I expect a large confidence interval for this parameter due to the small number of data points. Please, add confidence interval for the parameter. - I also recommend to compare exponential fit with other model families like parabolic or sin or others. AIC criterion could be used here for model comparison. - ""Such a pattern of exponential growth in both mean and variance is indicative of stochastic instability of the organism state..."" - this is the key phrase I saw in multiple papers from your group. I assume using this statement you implicitly refer readers to the Wiener process property of increase variance linearly with time. But I do not know which well-known process has exponential increase in variance. Could you please elaborate this explanation more in the text by adding the necessary literature references? - In your previous paper (Aging clocks, entropy and limits of age reversal) you obtained linear relation for human blood PC1 scores, no relation for PC2 scores and hyperbolic relation for PC3. My question is why PC2 in humans shows no relation with respect to some function? - I also interested why you changed methodology of CpG-sites pre-selection by comparing with the previous work in humans? - ""The distribution of the loading vector components for the exponential feature, DNAm-PC1, displays heavy tails, indicating the presence of sites significantly associated with this process"" - is the order of PCA loadings stable? Did you test the CpG sites with boostrap procedure, by subsampling the dataset and checking the stability of PC-loadings? - In figure 4b you demonstrate that CR mice demonstrate higher PC2/tBA values than Control. But what if this observations is due to the covariate shift between two datasets which was caught by PC2 and not caught by PC1 axis? This could explain the differences by a pure data distortions without attracting more complex theory. - No code - No supplementary info Minor: - ""...as heavy regularization tends to select a number of features approximately equal to the sample size, based on their correlation to the target phenotype."" - could you please add a reference to this theoretical result.

My research is focused on studying the interaction between plants and bacteria. Our laboratory has activities that include reading articles related to the areas of knowledge we study, called “Preprint Club”. For this activity, I selected your preprint called “Culturable approach to rice-root associated bacteria in Burkina Faso: diversity, plant growth- promoting rhizobacteria properties and cross-comparison with metabarcoding data” for reading and evaluation. In your manuscript you carried out tests with isolated bacteria and this was very interesting, studies like yours are very important to clarify the processes involved in the plant microbiome. However, I would like to make some observations about your manuscript: In the introduction I thought you covered several topics, which are important to the topic, but are not specific to your research so they are not that relevant. On the other hand, how do you make a direct comparison of your results with the study referring to your bibliographic reference (60) (Barro, et al 2022) I thought I could address aspects of this study in its introduction. Regarding the captions, in general I would suggest that the authors write more details when describing the figures so that it would be better to understand the results. This is important for the reader. Specifically in the caption of figure 4, we note that there is no caption for some images (specifically figure 4d) Regarding the figures in general, I would also like to suggest that the authors increase the size of the details in the figures. Specifically in figure 8, where the species included in the heat map are so close together and because they are very small, it is not possible to read them and this hinders the understanding of their results. And finally, I would like to suggest more photos and data on the results of the in vivo tests of the two rice cultivars. These are some notes that I thought were important to write, I hope they are useful for the authors. It was a pleasure to read the preprint of your research.

I am curious about your discrepancy with Rousset et al. (2022) regarding whether PARIS is a toxin-antitoxin system. They state, “We then focused on the system from E. coli B185 for subsequent experiments. Deletion of either ariA or ariB was non-toxic and abolished defense, excluding the hypothesis of a toxin-antitoxin system and showing that both components are required for activity (Figures S4C–S4E).” If ariB encodes a toxin, I expect they would have observed growth inhibition when deleting ariA. They don’t show the growth curves of these two mutants, only lawns with plaques in Figure S4. Additionally, Burman et al. (2024) state “As opposed to prototypical toxin-antitoxin systems, AriB isn’t toxic when expressed alone. This suggests that AriA activates AriB through a structural modification that enables dimerization or an unidentified posttranslational modification. More work will be necessary to determine the mechanism of AriB release and activation.” And “Expression of AriB alone is not toxic to the cells, nor does it provide phage defense [Rousset et al. (2022)]”. In your experiments, you only observe toxicity when overexpressing AriB, and not from the native promoter. Do you think this is an accurate representation of the natural/normal toxicity of AriB? Do you think these genes are transcriptionally regulated and only expressed at levels sufficient for toxicity during phage infection? Do you think the basal level of AriB expression from the native promoter is low enough to avoid the toxicity you observe during overexpression? Your results suggest that AriB toxicity doesn’t necessarily depend on “a structural modification that enables dimerization or an unidentified posttranslational modification” as posited by Burman et al. (2024). Do you think that when overexpressed at a high enough level a fraction of AriB can homodimerize without release from AriA by Ocr? You stated that “while we were initially unable to express and purify soluble AriB, we found that incubating AriA-AriB with Ocr released soluble AriB for further analysis (Figure 4c).” This made me wonder about the necessity of AriA+Ocr for AriB solubility and dimerization/activation. If you were to quantify the cellular/chromosomal abnormalities in the microscopy images presented in Figure 6 and Figure S15, do you think AriB overexpression would exhibit an intermediate phenotype to AriA and AriA+AriB+Ocr? It is hard to tell from the (single) images, but it looks like there is a higher proportion of dead (yellow) and abnormal cells in Figure S15C compared to S15A, perhaps suggesting increased AriB activity/toxicity when released from AriA by Ocr then when expressed on its own. It's nice that you have similar conclusions regarding the structure of the PARIS-Ocr complex as Burman et al. (2024). Additionally, their work supports your hypothesis of AriB blocking protein synthesis “potentially through cleavage of as-yet unidentified essential cellular tRNAs.” In short, what do you think underlies the discrepancy in AriB toxicity between your study, Rousset et al. (2022) and Burman et al. (2024)? Rousset, F., Depardieu, F., Miele, S., Dowding, J., Laval, A.L., Lieberman, E., Garry, D., Rocha, E.P., Bernheim, A. and Bikard, D. (2022).

""Scheduled"" caste comes from affirmative action by government of india which is based on British list. On the other hand, Other backward caste gained positive affirmation as a political alternative to Ram temple agitation. Both are collection of several castes. There are ""most"" backward caste MBC and so forth. I think ""Jati"" is the better way to go for genetic analysis. Several years ago, jati was involved with a specific profession and marriages took place inside those jati only. In my opinion it would be better if comparison was made between various Jati in different regions. Also, inside the same region among various jati. Also, It would be worthwhile to mention here that the regions marked north/central/east etc are based on political boundaries which came into existence in the 20th century, the main purpose of which was to exercise strict control over the population. It would not be appropriate to club entire 21st century political unit as a homogeneous one for genetic analysis. So, in summary, i think comparison could be more on the basis of traditional occupation based on jati, like yadav for milkmen, yet at the same time most important beneficiary of positive affirmation or kurmi/patel for vegetable grower etc.",2024-03-05T05:02:39,,vkfromIndia,10.1101/2024.02.15.580575,"50,000 years of Evolutionary History of India: Insights from ∼2,700 Whole Genome Sequences","Elise Kerdoncuff, Laurits Skov, Nick Patterson, Wei Zhao, Yuk Yee Lueng, Gerard D.
