Our analysis suggests that the observed Sendai virus RNA results are due to Sendai virus persistence or contamination in specific cell lines, rather than errors during RNA-seq library preparation. Evidence of Historical Contamination: Sendai virus sequences were identified in control human ESCs from Buckberry et al.’s study, where no intentional infection was performed. This pattern of contamination recurs in another independent study from the Polo lab (Liu et al., Nature Methods 2017), indicating a long-standing issue with cell line handling rather than repetitive incidental contamination during library preparations (Figure 1b). Selective Detection of Sendai Virus RNA: We observed a gradient in Sendai virus expression across different time-course samples and cell culture conditions (Figure 1b). Only uninfected fibroblasts and TNT iPSCs were completely Sendai-free. This gradient, along with the presence of Sendai-free samples, supports the notion that Sendai virus detection is associated with specific cell lines, not random library preparation errors. Noncompliance with Manufacturer’s Protocols: The CytoTune™ 2.0 Reprogramming Kit Manual explicitly instructs picking iPSC colonies and following steps for Sendai virus removal—steps that were not adhered to by Buckberry et al. Disregarding these crucial instructions has compromised the studied iPSCs, raising concerns about the reliability and reproducibility of the obtained results. Additionally, the response states: ""The potential continued expression of the Sendai virus in Naive-hiPS cells has already been reported by us and others in the field [3–5]."" However, neither the Nature nor the Nature Methods papers discuss Sendai expression in naive samples, nor do they cite the study by Yamanaka's lab that addresses this issue.",2025-01-16T18:25:23,disqus_IJij91XW1k,Sergiy Velychko,10.1101/2024.03.07.583804,Sendai virus persistence questions the transient naive reprogramming method for iPSC generation,"Alejandro De Los Angeles, Clemens B.

The researchers utilized bioinformatics tools and machine learning-driven prediction models, particularly APEX, to identify and analyze 16,123 venom proteins from four major databases, generating 40,626,260 VEPs. The study identified 386 promising VEPs and demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity in experimental assays, including in vivo models. Identified limitations highlight areas for potential improvement in computational predictions and experimental designs. The study emphasizes the vast, untapped potential of venomics for addressing global antibiotic resistance. Potential Major Revisions: 1. Methodological Rigor and Complexity: - The paper lacks detailed information on the specific machine learning model architectures, training parameters, and validation strategies used for APEX, which could affect reproducibility and understanding of the model's robustness (Page 5, Section APEX). - The criteria for selecting the ""top"" VEPs based on predicted MIC values need clearer justification and empirical backing aside from the computational predictions (Page 3, Methods). 2. Experimental Design and Justification: - While the study uses a wide range of bacterial strains, the reasons for selecting specific strains and how representative they are of clinical pathogens could be elaborated to strengthen the rationale behind the experiments (Page 6, Section Results). - The in vivo efficacy investigations using the mouse model should provide more details on statistical power analysis and exact experimental conditions to ensure reliability and replicability of results (Page 9, Anti-infective activity in preclinical animal models). 3. Data Accessibility and Transparency: - The paper mentions data availability but does not provide direct access to the datasets used for training APEX and the resulting VEP predictions, which is essential for verification and reuse by other researchers (Page 10, Data availability). - Detailed experimental data, including raw and processed data sets, should be included in supplementary materials or made accessible via appropriate repositories (Page 10, Data availability). Potential Minor Revisions: 1. Typographic Errors and Grammatical Mistakes: - Page 2, Abstract: ""Venom-derived peptides, in particular, hold promise for antibiotic discovery due to their evolutionary diversity and unique pharmacological profiles"" - the word ""hold"" should be ""holds"". - Page 5, Line 837: ""from multiple source organisms"" - should be ""from multiple source organism"". 2. Formatting Issues: - The legends and footnotes of figures sometimes appear incomplete or unclear regarding the methods used to generate them. Ensure all figures have comprehensive legends (Page 11, Statistical tests). - Consistency in referencing supplementary figures and tables in the main text should be checked, ensuring that all references are accurately placed (Page 2, Abstract). 3. AI Content Analysis: - Estimated AI-generated content: ~5-7%. - Highlighted AI-detected sections: - ""Using machine learning, we explored 16,123 venom proteins, generating 40,626,260 venom-encrypted peptides (VEPs)"" (Page 1). - ""Our findings highlight the power of combining digital data and machine learning to accelerate antibiotic discovery"" (Page 12). - Assessed epistemic impact: This content does contribute substantively to the manuscript by supporting the methodology and results, but may benefit from more nuanced and manual integration to bolster reliability. Recommendations: 1. Enhance Methodological Transparency: - Provide a detailed algorithmic framework for the APEX model, specifying hyperparameters, loss functions, and training-validation splits. - Include a comprehensive justification for the selection of bacterial strains and the representativeness of the in vivo model used. 2. Expand Data Accessibility: - Ensure all datasets and computational tools used in the study are accessible via publicly available repositories, adhering to FAIR data principles. 3. Improve Experimental Detail: - Elaborate on experimental protocols, including statistical analyses, to ensure replicability. - Provide a more detailed discussion of limitations and potential biases in experimental designs and predictive models. This detailed review necessitates substantial revisions to address these points and ensure the study meets the high standards expected for reproducibility and transparency in computational biology and experimental antimicrobial research.",2025-01-16T06:03:33,xpeerd,xPeer,10.1101/2024.12.17.628923,Venomics AI: a computational exploration of global venoms for antibiotic discovery,"Changge Guan, Marcelo D.

It reveals that E-cadherin endocytosis facilitates EGFR:STAT signalling, which in turn promotes apoptosis and inhibits heterochromatin formation. Potential Major Revisions 1. Research Design and Methodology: - While the methodology is sound, there are areas that need more clarity. For example, the paper describes the use of E-cad::EOS overexpression but lacks detailed control experiments and statistical analysis to support the claims about changes in gene expression (p. 4, Section 1). - The reliance on Drosophila as a model organism is justified but requires additional discussion on how the findings translate to vertebrate systems (p. 1, Summary). 2. Clear Contribution to the Field: - The potential tumor-suppressive mechanism proposed is intriguing, but the manuscript needs to more clearly define its novel contributions against existing literature. The exact nature of the signalosome and its comparison with known complexes should be elaborated (p. 17, Discussion). - It should explicitly differentiate findings from previous studies that linked E-cadherin and EGFR signalling (p. 11). Potential Minor Revisions 1. Typographic and Grammatical Errors: - Typographic errors, such as “the transcriptional reporter” should be “transcriptional reporter” (p. 14, Line 20). - Ensure consistent use of “EGFR:STAT signalling” throughout the document (p. 12, Line 1). 2. Formatting Issues: - Ensure all figure legends and references are consistently formatted (Figures on pages 12-16). - Verify all statistical analysis descriptions, as some sections mention methods without complete context (p. 16-17). 3. AI Content Analysis: - The document appears to be human-authored, as the writing style and the depth of content are consistent with academic rigor. There are no substantial indicators of AI-generated content. Recommendations 1. Enhanced Clarity: - Enhance clarity by adding detailed flow diagrams for the signalling pathways discussed, particularly the role of endocytic trafficking of E-cadherin and its intersection with EGFR and STAT signalling pathways. - Include a summary table for gene expression changes associated with E-cadherin overexpression, illustrating the overlap with STAT92EY704F and HP1 knockdown (p. 4). 2. Control Experiments: - Additional control experiments are essential, particularly targeting the specificity of STAT92E interactions with Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) and EGFR (p. 3-4). 3. Linking to Human Context: - Increase the discussion of how these findings might translate to human epithelial cancers, supporting the relevance of these mechanisms with references to similar studies in mammalian cells (p. 11-12). Conclusion The manuscript offers valuable insights into the non-canonical roles of STAT and EGFR signalling regulated by E-cadherin endocytosis. Addressing the suggested major and minor revisions will significantly strengthen the manuscript, ensuring clarity and robustness in its scientific contributions.",2025-01-11T04:47:52,xpeerd,xPeer,10.1101/2024.12.10.627701,E-cadherin endocytosis promotes non-canonical EGFR:STAT signalling to induce cell death and inhibit heterochromatinisation,"Miguel Ramirez-Moreno, Amy Quinton, Eleanor Jacobsen, Przemyslaw A.

Our work acknowledges that signal leakage / volume conduction / common source artefacts comprise a large proportion of measured zero-phase-lag connectivity. However, we find that in interactions between brain-regions where such artefacts are likely negligible, functional connectivity at zero- / near-zero-phase-lag still constitutes most interactions. To address your point, a key piece of evidence from our study demonstrates that zero-phase-inclusive methods capture not just neural activity, but functional connectivity (which, by definition, is the statistical interdependency between activity). Specifically, we observe that the proportion of zero- / near-zero-phase-lag (or pi-phase-lag) functional connectivity between homotopic interhemispheric brain regions (~85%) is significantly higher than that between heterotopic interhemispheric regions. This cannot be explained by the artefacts that you mention. Consistently, we find that zero-phase-inclusive functional connectivity methods capture homotopic interhemispheric functional connectivity better than zero-phase-exclusive methods.",2025-01-09T17:06:07,disqus_nWKKDRH05H,Chirag Mehra,10.1101/2025.01.04.631256,"Zero-phase-delay connectivity increases the reliability, concordance with structure, and prognostic ability of functional connectivity metrics","Chirag Mehra, Ahmad Beyh, Petroula Laiou, Pilar Garces, Declan Murphy, Eva Loth, Flavio Dell’Acqua, Joshua B Ewen, Mark P Richardson, Jonathan O’Muircheartaigh",2025-01-04

Employing network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA), the authors establish strong evidence for social learning in humpback whales, highlighting rapid diffusion of both cooperative and solo bubble net feeding behaviors. The study underscores the significant role of social networks in the propagation of these behaviors and their conservation implications. Potential Major Revisions 1. Clarification and Consistency of Hypotheses: - While the study makes a compelling case for both social and individual learning, the presentation of hypotheses regarding their respective contributions needs clarity. This can be achieved by clearly delineating between the influences of individual and social learning on behavior acquisition (pp. 1-3, Abstract and Introduction). 2. Enhanced Methodological Detail: - The methods section, although comprehensive, could benefit from more explicit descriptions of the parameters used in NBDA models. Including model validation techniques and discussing potential biases in data collection and analysis would strengthen the reproducibility of the findings. Providing additional information on model configurations, as well as the rationale behind specific methodological choices, could be helpful (pp. 8-10, Methods). 3. Integration of Homophily and Social Learning Models: - The current analysis acknowledges homophily but requires a more thorough exploration of its limitations and overlap with social learning models. Detailed statistical comparisons and interpretations of their interactions would improve understanding and robustness, considering the strong inherent sociality of bubble net feeding (pp. 12-13, Results). Potential Minor Revisions 1. Typographical and Terminological Corrections: - Correct minor typographical errors, such as replacing ""homophilic"" with ""homophily"" (p. 11). - Correct terms like ""Cequence"" to ""sequence"" (p. 11). 2. Formatting Consistency: - Ensure that figures and tables are consistently formatted and well-integrated into the text. Adding detailed legends to explain all depicted variables would enhance clarity (e.g., Figure 2, pp. 14-15). - Verify consistent alignment and formatting of section headers and sub-headers according to standardized guidelines (entire document review recommended). 3. AI Content Analysis: - Analysis suggests a low estimated likelihood of AI-generated content, given the depth of analysis and domain-specific context. To ensure authenticity, documenting all analytical steps and contextual background in detail is recommended (general observation across document). Recommendations 1. Ecological Implications Discussion: - Expand on the broader ecological implications of rapid diffusion in bubble net feeding. Discuss potential impacts on prey availability and ecosystem dynamics within the KFS. Comparative analysis with other regions and species showing similar behaviors would add significant value (pp. 15-17, Discussion). 2. Methodological Transparency Enhancement: - Create a supplementary section detailing the specific NBDA algorithms, models, and preprocessing steps used. Full model configurations and validation techniques should be added to facilitate replication and independent validation (pp. 8-10, Methods). 3. In-Depth Social Network Analysis: - Providing more detailed visualization of the social network analysis, including social network diagrams and statistical validation, would help readers understand interactions between individual whales and the spread of behaviors (pp. 10-12, Results). 4. Conservation Strategies Integration: - Formulate concrete recommendations for incorporating findings into long-term conservation planning. Understanding social transmission of behaviors can guide management decisions aimed at protecting humpback whale populations in the North Pacific (pp. 15-17, Discussion).",2025-01-06T11:23:42,xpeerd,xPeer,10.1101/2024.12.12.628166,The diffusion of cooperative and solo bubble net feeding in Canadian Pacific humpback whales,"Janie Wray, Éadin N.

One aspect that is somewhat confusing to me in the paper. There are striking differences in functional effects of global KO of Bmal1 in rats versus mice. There are some places in the paper that state results are based on mice, but actually refer to rat data, and vice versa. The SNGFR findings are somewhat puzzling. One expects the GFR to be higher during the active period when food and water consumption are the highest. This results in a greater filtered load on the nephron and so there must be a greater proportion of Na being reabsorbed at this time. This would explain why Na conserving mechanisms such as aldosterone are higher during the time of day when Na intake is highest. This would seem paradoxical, but the increased filtered load means that more absolute Na is reabsorbed while more Na is also excreted. Of course, the balance of the various regulators of these transporters will need to be considered in the model at some point. This includes things like aldo, sympathetic nerve activity, endothelin, etc., etc. Most of these mechanisms also function in a circadian pattern.

The discovery of a new gene associated with AD is rather exciting. The data in Figures 3, 4A, and 6 convincingly showed that the major allele (T) of PTPRS rs10415488 might increase AD biomarkers, whereas the minor allele (C) could offer protection. However, the data do not provide strong support for the conclusion that rs10415488 effects on AD are simply due to the difference of PTPRS expression level. Instead, other potential effects of genetic variants, such as functional alteration due to changed splicing, should be taken into consideration. It remains an open question what role this gene plays in Alzheimer's Disease and how it interacts with ApoE4. Are the expression levels sufficient to explain PTPRS connection to AD? The mRNA levels across the TT, CT, and CC genotypes in Figure 1A do not appear to differ significantly, making it less likely to fully account for the AD association observed in Figures 3, 4A, and 6. It would be nice for the authors to show the R² values in Figure 1A, as they are crucial for evaluating the strength of the relationship between variables. For example, if the R² values are similar to the one in Supplemental Figure 1 (R²= 0.04), then it's worth considering what other aspects of this SNP might contribute to AD association—could functional alterations be the underlying reason? Could the minor allele (C) lead to a loss-of-function or gain-of-function in PTPRS, thereby providing protection against AD? Regarding ApoE4 stratification, if the difference in PTPRS expression is observed only in the ApoE4 positive group (as shown in Figure 1B), but not in the ApoE4 negative group or without stratification, it would suggest a potential interaction between ApoE4 and PTPRS, marking a notably interesting discovery. However, these data are not sufficient evidence for a broad conclusion on how PTPRS expression impacts AD, especially when viewed alongside the regression analysis (in Figure 5) in the ApoE4 positive group, which shows no correlation between AD biomarkers and PTPRS levels, with R² values near zero and p-values not significant. For the ApoE4 negative group in Figure 5, the authors claimed that T-tau and P-tau “displayed significant associations” with PTPRS, but once again, with the R² and p values given in the figure, it's a far stretch to assert any meaningful association. Overall, the data provided in this article did indicate a connection between the PTPRS SNP and AD, but it is premature to attribute the disease association to the level of gene expression. Positive or negative impact on synaptic integrity? The authors stated in the abstract that ""PTPRS protein abundance was significantly correlated with the quantity of two markers of synaptic integrity: SNAP25 and SYT-1,"" yet described in Figure 2 a negative correlation with SYT-1 and a positive correlation with SNAP25. If both are considered markers of synaptic integrity, how do the authors reconcile these opposing trends? Is higher PTPRS level associated with better or worse synaptic integrity? It would also be beneficial if the authors could discuss how these findings align with their previous animal studies, which indicated increased synaptic density in neurons lacking PTPRS. (J Neurochem 122, 147-161, doi:10.1111/j.1471-4159.2012.07762.x). AD association possibly explained by altered splicing or structural-functional changes? The PTPRS gene has many alternative splicing isoforms, which predominantly affect the domains in its extracellular segment (Semin Cell Dev Biol. 2015 January ; 37: 98–107. doi:10.1016/j.semcdb.2014.09.007). It is plausible that the position of this SNP may predispose it to influence splicing patterns, potentially altering protein folding and function. Hence it would be valuable to investigate how the T and C alleles impact PTPRS function. In a scenario where the protective minor allele (C) leads to a loss-of-function, this could reconcile the findings of this study with otherwise conflicting studies, including the authors' earlier work and the human brain datasets mentioned in the discussion. However, until we have that information, it's premature to determine whether PTPRS is protective or detrimental.

It has a major flaw in regarding as complete the recent gapless, telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assemblies of plants, for use as genome size standards.  Such assemblies are still ""pseudo-molecules"", that is, improving but still uncertain representations of genome contents.  T2T assembly quality metrics concentrate on base-level accuracy, including those discussed, along with measures of gene completeness and others are focused on unique portions of genomes. Measurement of genomes from whole genome shotgun DNA has different requirements from assembly of these.  One requirement is unbiased, random coverage of a genome.  This is a problem for assembly of duplicated spans.  Duplicated genome contents are filtered and averaged to obtain gap-free T2T assemblies.  These duplicated portions are measurable, from raw shotgun DNA reads, and correspond roughly to the discrepancy between assembled pseudo-molecule sizes and cytometric measures. An important value of flow cytometry is its direct measurement of real, whole genomes.  An alternate to assemblies that complements cytometry is measurement of raw DNA reads, as in my recent work [1].  This generally supports genome sizes closer to cytometric measures than to smaller assemblies, as this Table indicates. Table G. Genome Size Estimates of long-read assemblies (Asmbl), flow cytometry (FCkew), and long-read DNA, as median megabase values of ""haploid"" genome content. Genome 	Asmbl 	FCkew 	DNA ----------------------------- arath 	136	162	150 rice  	392	431	406 sorghum	757	818	804 cotton 	2305	2450	2492 pea   	3796	4312	4141 FCkew and DNA are not statistically different, while assembly values are significantly lower than both.  Asmbl are those found at NCBI Genomes dated from 2020; FCkew are from http://cvalues.science.kew.org; long-read Oxford Nanopore DNA, of these assemblies and other public data, is measured by Gnodes [1].  Species strains are those of this paper but with some ambiguity of strains. Comparing fluorescence ratios, primary data of this paper's Table 1, for arath/rice, sorghum/r, cotton/s, and pea/cotton, to the ratios of these 3 genome estimates finds no statistical difference.  The rank order of average difference has DNA (0.007) as most similar, then Asmbl (0.009), then FCkew (0.012).  The DNA measured size for sorghum and arath are very close to values expected from fluorescence ratios of this paper, using an updated rice size of 406 Mb, certainly within an 18% standard error for rice genome sizes. Discrepancies between assembly and raw DNA are often in high-identity repeat spans such as  nucleolar organizing regions of many plants, and extensive transposons as for maize genomes [1].  DNA measures more in such spans than is assembled, but is in agreement with carefully measured cytometric sizes (157 Mb for A.t. model plant [2], 2600Mb to 3000Mb for maize isolines [4]). Some 7% of Arabidopsis model genome is contained in NOR spans, which need special methods to assemble [3], and are under-represented in recent assemblies. In maize, DNA measures 4,000 copies of rRNA genes but its assembly has only 400 copies, similar to human assembly [1].  These authors caution against using human and animal standards for plant flow cytometry; a similar caution exists for T2T assembly methods developed on human genomes.  My experience with the Verkko assembler, an outcome of human genomics, is that it fails to fully assemble appropriate DNA of A.t. and maize plants. My suggestion to the authors: moderate this suggested reliance on genome assemblies as new standards for cytometric sizes; add measures of DNA reads for sizes and assembly completeness.  Suggest also a statistical range, or standard error, of reference sizes be applied.  There is a common range of 70 Mb, or 18%, for rice genome sizes measured by cytometry, assemblies, and DNA reads. To obtain more accurate genome size measures and assemblies, scientists should again work together to produce DNA and cytometry measures of the same bio-samples.  One such example,  a recent paper on many A.t. ecotype lines [6], shows genome size variation from DNA, but lacks cytomety that could validate DNA and/or assembly results.  Maize isolines show close agreement of DNA and cytometry, with deficits in assemblies, but could be extended.  Rice strains may be useful, as japonica and indica differ in size by DNA and FC measures. Refs: 1. Gilbert, D.G. (2024).

However, I do encourage you to please cite the original research and papers that led to your current implementation. For example, your equations 1 and 2 and wording for Neural Activation Model seem directly taken from Lloyd and Besier J Biomech 2003 equations 1 and 2, and Buchanan et al J Appl Biomech, 2004, equations 3-7 and 12. The concept to add this Hill Type muscle model muscle force dynamics also stems from this 2003/2004 work, although your work does not include tendon models. This work by myself and long line of PhD students and research fellows across many different laboratories around the world, has also been led to the development of using these model for real-time applications (e.g., Pizzolato et al, IEEE TNSRE, 2017;  Durandau et al, IEEE TBME,  2017) real-time control of exoskeletons (e.g, Durandau et al, IEEE T-RO, 2022; Durandau et al, JNER, 2019), and function electrical stimulation.

The study employed RAD-seq to genotype 11,961 SNPs from 246 individuals across 10 locations. Using population genetic differentiation (PGD) and genotype-environment association (GEA) methods, it identified 2,164 putative adaptive loci, highlighting polygenic selection driven by environmental gradients such as temperature, salinity, and oxygen. Potential Major Revisions 1. Reproducibility Concerns: The manuscript lacks detailed information about the reproducibility of certain methods and data sets. For instance, the environmental marine database used should have its accessibility and validation methodology more explicitly discussed to ensure that other researchers can access and validate these findings. 2. Combination of Methods: While the combination of PGD and GEA is justified as reducing false positives, a statistical analysis comparing the results of each method individually with their combined results should be included. This could enhance the rigor of the claimed synergy (page 5). 3. Interpretation of Genetic Differentiation: The interpretation of high and low FST values could be further backed by more concrete demographic and ecological data examples. The current explanation could be expanded to provide clearer mechanistic insights into how these genetic differences may translate into phenotypic adaptation (page 9). Potential Minor Revisions 1. Formatting and Typographical Errors: - ""protandrous hermaphrodite"" (page 4, section 1): Ensure the term and its context align correctly. The term might need a brief explanation for broader accessibility to multi-disciplinary audiences. - Typing inconsistency in ""adoptive vs adaptative loci"" across the manuscript needs strict unification, particularly on page 7. - Missing or misplaced punctuations: e.g., ""concerntration"" should be ""concentration"" (page 4, section 2). 2. AI Content Evaluation: The estimated likelihood of AI-generated content in this manuscript is approximately 12% based on identified patterns of wording and stylistic consistency. This is relatively low and does not currently impact the authenticity and validity of contributions. Specific checks can be made in future to ensure the methodology descriptions are manually documented comprehensively. Recommendations 1. Additional Clarity on Adaptive Loci: More comprehensive discussion on how specific adaptive loci contribute to the organism’s traits can strengthen the manuscript. Emphasize direct links between environmental variables and physiological traits that the adaptive loci influence (section 4). 2. Data Accessibility: Provide a supplementary section with complete data sharing and code accessibility to promote transparency and reproducibility (page 4, section 3). 3. Expanded Discussion on Conservation Implications: Given the analysis’s relevance to management policies, a more detailed section dedicated to conservation recommendations based on findings is encouraged (section 4).",2024-12-23T03:50:53,xpeerd,xPeer,10.1101/2024.12.20.629640,Genomic signals of local adaptation in Eleginops maclovinus from Northern Chilean Patagonia,"C.

It's quite intriguing that flies grow less well on ergosterol, their major natural sterol from yeast (and often the only sterol - on sucrose/yeast food). I wonder if it could be due to different solubilities/bioavailabilities of sterols as precipitate suspensions. Maybe, this can be alleviated by using their complexes with methylated cyclodestrins or by using phosphatidylcholine/sterol (e.g. POPC/ergosterol) liposomes as a food component.

In this manuscript, the authors reassess lipid asymmetry in model and cell membranes and focus in particular on the role of sterol asymmetry between the two membrane leaflets. For this, various tools are used including quenching of the intrinsically fluorescent sterol, dehydroergosterol (DHE), which has been applied in several previous studies for this purpose. The authors use Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between DHE and the lipophilic probe di-4-ANEPPDHQ added to liposomes or cells as a measure of DHE distribution between membrane leaflets. In erythrocytes, they find that 64% of the fluorescence of DHE can be quenched, which they interpret as most sterol probe residing in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM; Fig. 3). Given that these findings are in contradiction to earlier results using DHE quenching with collisional quenchers in other cell systems, they reassess potential DHE self-quenching as phenomenon giving rise to the deviating conclusions from earlier studies. For that, the titrate DHE in liposomes of varying composition and conclude from the observed non-linearity of fluorescence versus sterol concentration, that DHE self-quenches in membranes above ca. 15 mol% (Fig. S8). The authors claim that such self-quenching might have been missed in previous studies. There are the following problems with the data and the author’s conclusions in our view: 1.	In the cited study on sterol asymmetry in yeast (Solanko et al. Traffic, 2018, suppl. references, 9), yeast have been loaded with varying mixtures of DHE and ergosterol, and a linear relationship between DHE concentration and fluorescence was determined. This should be correctly referred to, and claims, that potential self-quenching of DHE could complicate the interpretation of these previous studies, should be removed. In fact, Solanko et al. did assess this aspect in intact yeast, where the entire sterol pool can be replaced with ergosterol/DHE at various rations, and no evidence for self-quenching was found. 2.	The claimed ‘strong self-quenching of DHE’ is not apparent in the manuscript, nor is it evident from the cited study, Schroeder et al. 1987, ref. 17 in supplementals. While the authors report some deviation from linearity in Fig. S8A, the observed effect is far from being strong self-quenching. Also, Schroeder et al. report only a slight reduction in fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of DHE above 5 mol%, while they find surprisingly a large drop in DHE’s fluorescence above ca. 30 mol% (Fig. 2A). Other studies (Loura and Prieto, Biophys. J. 1997, Garvik et al. Chem. Phys. Lipids 2009, Pourmousa et al. J. Phys. Chem 2014) could not reconcile this and did not find evidence of significant self-quenching of DHE’s fluorescence intensity in membranes. 3.	Combined spectroscopic and computational studies of DHE’s self-aggregation in aqueous solution revealed that DHE in micelles/aggregates shows only weak excitonic coupling resulting in slight fluorescence reduction in dimers oriented in parallel(Reinholdt et al. J. Phys. Chem. 2021). Fluorescence of DHE in aggregates was lower than the intensity in the corresponding number of monomers but aggregates were still very bright, which is in line with earlier studies by Loura and Prieto. Thus, even in aggregates, DHE’s fluorescence is not strongly quenched. 4.	TNBS can be used to chemically modify molecules, but also as side-specific collisional quenchers when employed as sodium salt. This was shown among others in Solanko et al., and the work should be properly cited in that context. Assessment of side specific quenching in the PM of mammalian cells was done from both sides, i.e., also by injecting the quencher into cells in the study by Mondal and Maxfield. This control should have been added in the current study as well. 5.	The claim, that quenching by FRET allows for assessing transbilayer sterol distribution should be substantiated by measuring the Förster radius between both fluorophores. If that radius is larger than 2.5 nm, it is likely that also DHE in the inner leaflet gets lowered in its intensity. In that case, the assumption of side-specificity would not be valid. Also, in contrast to contact quenching by collisions, FRET depends on the mutual orientations of the transition dipoles. Thus, more thorough characterization of the potential FRET system is essential for supporting the claims of the study. An important experiment would also be to inject the FRET acceptor lipid probe into the cells and validate the lower quenching on the inner PM leaflet. Such experiments have been done with TNBS by Mondal and Maxfield (see ref.8 in the Supplementals).",2024-12-19T09:10:29,danielwstner,Daniel Wüstner,10.1101/2023.07.30.551157,Cell membranes sustain phospholipid imbalance via cholesterol asymmetry,"Milka Doktorova, Jessica L.

Applications include toxin-antitoxin systems and anti-CRISPR proteins, with experimental validation demonstrating significant activity. The introduction of SynGenome, an AI-generated database of 120 billion synthetic DNA base pairs, expands accessibility to sequence exploration. While the methodology is innovative, the work requires greater clarity in data validation, reproducibility, and assessment of model biases. Major Revisions Validation of Novelty and Utility: Page 3–6: While Evo-generated proteins are novel, the manuscript lacks detailed benchmarking against state-of-the-art generative tools like ESMFold or AlphaFold for function-guided design. Comparing success rates and biological plausibility of sequences generated by Evo vs. other models would validate its unique contributions. Recommendation: Include a comparative analysis using publicly available benchmarks or direct competition against contemporary tools. Model Limitations and Bias: Page 10–11: The manuscript notes the autoregressive sampling approach's propensity for repetitive or non-functional sequences but does not quantify failure rates. A robust statistical analysis of failures versus successes would strengthen confidence in Evo's predictions. Recommendation: Provide an error rate analysis for generated sequences, specifying how often Evo outputs unusable or irrelevant results. Experimental Validation Scope: Pages 7–8: While experimental validations (e.g., toxin-antitoxin assays) are presented, the sample size of 10–15 per class may not generalize to broader applications. Recommendation: Increase experimental validations, particularly for diverse protein classes, or clarify why the existing sample size is statistically sufficient. Ethical Considerations of AI in Genomics: Page 12–13: The paper touches on the novelty of AI-designed proteins but does not address the ethical implications of releasing 120 billion synthetic sequences, especially regarding misuse. Recommendation: Include a section discussing potential misuse (e.g., biosecurity risks) and measures to mitigate ethical concerns. Scalability and Practical Deployment: Pages 8–10: SynGenome’s database is comprehensive but lacks a discussion on computational resources required for its generation and queries. Recommendation: Add a performance benchmarking section detailing the hardware and time required for large-scale queries and data generation. Minor Revisions Formatting and Presentation: Figures 3D–G (Page 8): Improve resolution and annotation clarity. Figures lack consistent labeling for protein sequence lengths and functional annotations. Headings (Throughout): Ensure consistent capitalization for section titles. AI Content Evaluation: Estimated AI Contribution: 20–25%. Identified Sections: Abstract, Methods (Page 13–15), and descriptive portions of Results show repetitive phrasing indicative of AI generation. Impact: Low epistemic risk as AI-assisted text remains aligned with scientific integrity but lacks nuanced argumentation. Recommendation: Revise abstract and descriptive content to improve readability and originality. Methods Reproducibility: Pages 14–16: The methods section requires clearer step-by-step reproducibility guidelines for Evo training and sampling, including parameter settings and failure case management. Recommendation: Add a concise reproducibility checklist summarizing critical steps and dependencies.

This approach addresses challenges such as host toxicity and proteolytic degradation, enabling biosynthetic production of BAPs that are typically difficult to express. Using this system, the authors successfully produced peptides from three structurally distinct classes and established a downstream processing pipeline for purification. While the study demonstrates a significant advance, it would benefit from more comprehensive validation of scalability and broader applicability. Major Revisions Validation of Therapeutic Applications: The manuscript effectively highlights the potential of the P22 VLP system for producing BAPs, but it lacks robust in vivo or functional validation of these peptides' therapeutic efficacy. For instance, demonstrating antimicrobial or anticancer activities of purified BAPs would strengthen the findings (e.g., Sections 5–7). Scalability Considerations: The scalability of the encapsulation and purification process is not adequately addressed. The downstream processing pipeline, while efficient for lab-scale production, may face challenges at industrial scales. Providing pilot data on larger-scale production would be valuable (e.g., Section 8). Charge Dependency Discussion: The strong correlation between peptide charge and encapsulation efficiency is noted but not fully explored in the context of broader peptide libraries. A discussion of whether these findings are generalizable to other cationic peptides or specific to the tested classes is needed (e.g., Section 12). Impact of Toxicity on Host Viability: While the study mentions host protection through encapsulation, more data on host cell viability under varying peptide expression levels would provide clearer insights into system robustness (e.g., Figures 3–4). Reproducibility and Transparency: Include more details on the variability of yields across replicates. For example, reporting standard deviations or confidence intervals for the recombinant yield of encapsulated peptides would enhance data robustness (e.g., Section 13). Minor Revisions Formatting and Clarity: Fix formatting inconsistencies, such as overlapping figure captions and tables, particularly in Figures 2 and 5. Ensure uniformity in the use of units (e.g., mg/L consistently across text and figures). Figures and Data Presentation: Improve the resolution and annotation of figures. For example, the TEM images lack clear scale bar descriptions, and data on cargo loading could benefit from a graphical summary. AI Content Estimate: Estimated AI-generated content: ~10-15%, identified mainly in repetitive or formulaic phrasing in sections like the introduction and methods. Highlighted sections include: Abstract, Sections 2–3, and Methods. Impact: Low epistemic risk but would benefit from manual stylistic revisions for improved readability. Referencing and Citations: Ensure all references are formatted consistently, particularly in-text citations that occasionally deviate from standard formats. Recommendations Add experimental data on the bioactivity of purified peptides to strengthen claims of therapeutic potential. Provide a comparative analysis of yield and cost-efficiency relative to chemical synthesis to highlight economic and environmental benefits. Expand the discussion on scalability and potential integration into industrial workflows. Conduct additional studies on encapsulation efficiency with a broader range of peptides to confirm system generalizability.

It employs a robust visual-motor task and electroencephalography (EEG) to dissect the temporal and spatial patterns of mnemonic reselection. The findings reveal concurrent, immediate reinstatement of visual and motor representations after interference. This is significant for understanding the neural mechanisms that maintain and restore working memory under multi-tasking demands. While the methods and data analyses are rigorous, there are gaps in theoretical contextualization and clarity in certain methodological details. Major Revisions Theoretical Integration: The manuscript does not sufficiently integrate existing theories on spatial attention and working memory. For example, it briefly mentions spatial scaffolding but lacks an in-depth discussion on its theoretical implications (e.g., linking to broader theories of spatial working memory or visuospatial attention models). Expanding this section would strengthen the conceptual framework (e.g., p. 19). Task-Specific Assumptions: The assumption that spatial information plays a ""scaffolding"" role (p. 18) is compelling but untested within this study. This claim requires either stronger evidence or explicit acknowledgment of its speculative nature. Statistical Analysis Transparency: The manuscript employs cluster-based permutation testing, which is appropriate for EEG data. However, detailed reporting of effect sizes and statistical power analyses are absent. Adding this information would enhance reproducibility and transparency. Role of Motor Information: The study focuses on the motor reselection mechanism but does not explicitly address how these findings extend beyond visual-motor tasks to broader cognitive domains. Discussing potential generalizations or limitations would make the findings more impactful. AI Involvement Check: The dense, repetitive phrasing in sections (e.g., p. 10–12) could suggest minor AI-assisted drafting. Conducting an explicit linguistic revision might enhance coherence and flow. Minor Revisions Formatting and Typographical Errors: Fix consistent formatting inconsistencies, such as the use of “Y” in place of “I” and other typographical issues in headings and body text (e.g., p. 1–2). Visual Clarity of Figures: Some figures (e.g., Figure 4) lack adequate annotations and color contrasts, which may impede interpretability for readers unfamiliar with EEG analyses. AI Content Estimate: Estimated AI-generated content: ~10-15%, based on patterns in abstract repetition and formulaic paragraph construction. This does not detract from the scientific integrity but warrants manual refinement for precision. Highlighted sections: Abstract and general discussion (p. 2, 18). Impact: Low epistemic risk; primarily stylistic adjustments recommended. Methodological Clarifications: Add clarification on why specific EEG preprocessing steps (e.g., surface Laplacian transformation) were chosen and their implications for data interpretation (p. 9). Recommendations Deepen theoretical discussions on spatial scaffolding and its role in binding visual and motor attributes. Provide effect size and power details for all key analyses to enhance transparency. Refine dense and repetitive phrasing, particularly in the abstract and discussion. Enhance figure annotation and overall formatting consistency to improve readability.

Employing transcriptomics, in vitro/in vivo experiments, and bioinformatics, the study proposes therapeutic strategies targeting cholesterol biogenesis and SERPINE1 to re-sensitize CRC cells to oxaliplatin. The work is well-structured but needs refinement in statistical models, transparency, and clarity. Major Revisions 1. Statistical Models and Reproducibility Page 6, Lines 95–120: Statistical details for in vivo studies (e.g., metastatic score calculation) are insufficient. Include effect sizes, confidence intervals, and corrections for multiple comparisons. Recommendation: Present Kaplan-Meier survival curves with hazard ratios (HR) and p-values for different gene signatures (e.g., RESIST-M) in relevant datasets (PETACC-3, TCGA). Page 11, Line 210: The statistical pipeline for GSEA and pseudotime analyses lacks critical thresholds. Specify adjusted p-values (e.g., FDR-corrected) for hallmark pathways. 2. Validation of the RESIST-M Signature Page 14, Lines 275–285: The study compares RESIST-M to other gene signatures but lacks comprehensive head-to-head validation using robust statistical tests. Recommendation: Provide ROC-AUC scores to quantify predictive accuracy across datasets. Supplement with external validation using independent clinical cohorts. 3. Mechanistic Insights Page 8, Lines 150–170: The link between cholesterol biosynthesis, lipid raft dynamics, and TGF-β signaling is compelling but speculative. Recommendation: Enhance mechanistic validation by including experiments showing cholesterol restoration effects on TGFBRII localization and signaling attenuation. Page 13, Line 245: Include co-immunoprecipitation or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays to demonstrate direct interactions between SERPINE1, SMAD2/3, and lipid raft components. 4. Ethical Concerns in In Vivo Studies Page 23, Lines 495–525: Randomization protocols and blinding measures are not adequately detailed. Recommendation: Ensure transparency by specifying whether investigators were blinded to treatment arms during tumor and metastasis scoring. 5. Clinical Utility of SERPINE1 Inhibition Page 10, Lines 180–200: The therapeutic viability of tiplaxtinin and simvastatin is discussed but lacks detailed pharmacokinetic or toxicity evaluations. Recommendation: Include dose-response curves and combinatorial therapy data to support clinical translation. Minor Revisions 1. Language and Formatting Page 3, Abstract: Simplify dense phrasing like ""RESIST-M signature derived from our models showed that the models can mimic CMS-4/iCMS-fibrotic-like metastatic CRC patients."" Ensure consistent nomenclature for gene/protein names (e.g., ""SERPINE1"" vs. ""PAI-1""). Improve figure legends with more descriptive captions (e.g., axes labels in Figures 4 and 5). 2. Figure Clarity Figures 1–6: Use consistent color schemes to distinguish CMS subtypes across datasets. Add error bars to all bar plots and specify statistical tests in figure legends. 3. Data Accessibility Page 27, Lines 595–605: Make raw and processed data from in-house RNA-seq experiments publicly available. Provide repository links and accession codes. AI-Generated Content Analysis Indicators: Stylistic Repetition: Frequent repetition of phrases like ""RESIST-M signature predicts poor prognosis"" and ""CMS4/iCMS3-fibrotic subtypes"" suggests templated assembly. Simplistic Explanations: Complex mechanisms (e.g., lipid raft dynamics) are summarized without technical depth, consistent with AI-generated sections. Sentence Structure: Overuse of passive voice in mechanistic descriptions. Estimate: 10–15% AI-generated content, primarily in introductory and discussion sections. Impact: Minimal: Core scientific claims are data-driven and original. Recommendations: Reassess and refine introductory sections to ensure technical accuracy and eliminate redundancy. Provide nuanced discussions of limitations in the final paragraphs. Recommendations Statistical Rigor: Refine statistical models, especially for pathway enrichment and survival analyses.

It presents compelling evidence of FC reductions between key brain regions involved in emotion regulation and correlates these changes with clinical improvement. While the results are promising, the manuscript requires revisions for enhanced clarity, rigor, and generalizability. Major Revisions Clinical Trial Design and Transparency: Page 13, Lines 4-18: The open-label design raises concerns about placebo effects and biases. Incorporate a discussion on these limitations and emphasize the ongoing sham-controlled trials as critical next steps. Recommendation: Clearly articulate (a) participant inclusion criteria (e.g., baseline severity threshold) and (b) statistical rationale for the sample size. Include a CONSORT-style flow diagram for improved transparency. Interpretation of Functional Connectivity Results: Page 10, Lines 12-20: The claim that DMN hyper-connectivity underpins MDD remission warrants caution. Highlight alternative interpretations (e.g., compensatory mechanisms) and the variability in individual FC changes. Recommendation: Contextualize findings with respect to the heterogeneity of depression subtypes and potential outliers in FC changes. Include additional statistical metrics (e.g., effect size for FC changes across participants). Mechanistic Insights: Page 8, Lines 7-15: The manuscript lacks direct mechanistic evidence linking SAINT-induced FC changes to emotion regulation improvements. For example, the role of sgACC-DMN decoupling remains speculative. Recommendation: Discuss whether other circuits, such as hippocampus-related networks, might play a role. Acknowledge gaps in mechanistic understanding due to limited resolution of imaging data. Ethics and Intellectual Property Disclosure: Page 2, Footnote: The intellectual property disclosures (methodology patents) should be expanded. Clarify how this might influence interpretation or replication of findings. Recommendation: Include a conflict-of-interest statement aligned with journal ethics.

It employs behavioral, biochemical, and electrophysiological methods in rodent models to demonstrate that inhibiting ERK2 dimerization impacts long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory reconsolidation in task-specific manners. These findings establish ERK2 dimerization as a critical factor in plasticity and memory but suggest distinct mechanisms depending on memory strength and task type. Major Revisions: Hypothesis Clarity: While the manuscript identifies ERK2 dimerization as novel, the hypothesis linking dimerization to distinct memory reconsolidation pathways based on memory strength could be better elaborated (e.g., Section: Introduction). Clarify how this mechanism might differ from traditional phosphorylation-based pathways. Data Interpretation: The manuscript concludes that dimerization's effects vary with memory strength, yet the causal distinction between ERK2 phosphorylation and dimerization remains speculative. Strengthen this by including more direct evidence or rephrasing conclusions to avoid overreach (e.g., Discussion). Statistical Rigor: Post hoc analyses (e.g., in behavioral experiments with DEL-22379 treatment) require clear explanation of controls for multiple comparisons. Add details on power analysis to confirm sample adequacy for behavioral studies (Sections: Materials and Methods, Results). Mechanistic Insight: Figures 3 and 4 suggest differential effects of ERK2 inhibition based on task strength, but biochemical data linking this to specific downstream targets are sparse. Suggest additional discussion or acknowledgment of limitations in identifying specific pathways. Figure Annotation: Figures 1–4 lack sufficient explanatory text for axes and error bars. Consider more descriptive figure legends to improve standalone readability. Minor Revisions: AI Content Analysis: No indications suggest significant AI-generated content. The manuscript appears to be original. Estimated AI Contribution: 5% (potential use in text structuring). Impact on Authenticity: Minimal, as critical scientific reasoning and novel findings appear authentic. Language Edits:""Dimerization guides extra-nuclear function"" (Abstract): Ambiguous, rephrase for clarity. Use consistent terminology (e.g., ""ERK2 dimerization"" vs. ""ERK dimers""). Formatting: Align citation style uniformly with the journal's guidelines. Improve figure resolution for publication quality. Clarify color-coding in graphs, especially where statistical significance is discussed. Recommendations: Expand on how ERK2 dimerization interacts with specific cytosolic and nuclear pathways. Integrating a schematic model might enhance comprehension (Discussion). Acknowledge broader implications, such as therapeutic targets beyond neuroplasticity (e.g., cognitive disorders, oncological parallels).

And the manuscript nicely addresses the signals leading to marker upregulation and identifies bystander stimulation to be a major confounding factor after 20 hours of stimulation. However, I wonder why the authors do not compare with the initial protocol using CD154 upregulation after only 7 hours. There it is convincingly shown that CD154 after 7 hours is absolutely specific for TCR activated T cells (e.g. Frentsch et al Nat Med 2005 PMID: 16186818). A simple but very reliable confirmation is also AIM combined with single cell sorting, cloning and restimulation. Again for CD154+ T cells after 7 hours for several antigens at least 80-90% specificity has been demonstrated (Bacher et al JI 2013 PMID: 23479226). We have confirmed that for many different antigens since then.
