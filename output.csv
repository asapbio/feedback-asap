I found the methods, the results and the discussion quite convincing, with just a few questions and observations: 1. I understand that you used 11 additional JEV positive locations for external validation of model performance. 8 of these locations were additional piggeries, similarly to the 54 outbreaks at piggeries that you used to train your model. However, 3 of these were positive mosquito pools, which are very different, could have been collected far away from piggeries, and could be impacted by other factors. However, you didn't mention if model performance against these 3 positive pools was different than against the other 8. Can you comment on that? I understand that these are extremely low sample sizes, but it would be interesting to know if the model predicted those mostly correctly as well. 2. On page 8-9, you describe the habitat suitability modeling for Ardeidae birds. However, I don't see a similar descripticion for the habitat suitability modeling for feral pigs. Was that done the same way? 3. I understand your description that the stacked composite of ardeid suitability as a proxy for regional species richness, but that it only describes the fundamental, not the realized niche. Does this have to do with either alpha, beta or gamma diversity? 4. You're citing a paper by Furlong et al. describing the distribution of JEV mosquito vectors based on environmental niche modeling. Would it be possible to include maps of those distributions in your inhomogeneous point process framework as another covariate? Would it further improve the fit and the performance of the models, or would it be confounded with existing covariates? 5. On line 312, you mention sentinel chicken surveillance data. Was that also included? If yes, I missed it in the methods. 6. Figure 3 seems to indicate that the model was restricted to Queesnland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Is that correct? You don't mention that is the text. 7. On page 12, you mention that the model demonstrated strong associations between JEV outbreaks and proximity to waterways. However, the methods or Table S2 does not include ""proximity to waterways"" as a specific predictor. It only includes ""distances to inland wetland and riparian wetland systems"", and ""distances to rivers and streams"". Which one of these is ""proximity to waterways""? Or is it a combination of those? 8. I find it very interesting that increased precipitation and decreased temperature associated with La Nina were both associated with increased risk in univariate models, but not after accounting for landscape structure and ardeid suitability. I do wonder if this could be because of only looking at a single season where there wasn't much variation spatially across the three states studied, since La Nina affected the entire area. I also wonder if there was collinearity between increased precipitation, decreased temperature and landscape structure and ardeid suitability, which might explain the different results in the univariate vs the multivariate models. 9. I noticed that in the multivariate models you used both Ardeid species richness as well as the square of Ardeid species richness to incorporate a non-linear response. Why did you incorporate the quadratic response for this particular predictor variable, based on what analysis? And why haven't you done the same for the other predictors? 10. I understand that the relationship between JEV risk and Ardeid species richness was non-linear, such that the highest risk was at intermediate Ardeid richness. Were there particular Ardeid species for which the suitability was high at those intermediate Ardeid richness levels particularly, or was it pretty much random, or just based on the distribution of specific species? You do mention the dilution effect in the discussion, and I understand that there is limited information on the host competence of specific Ardeid species in Australia, but it would be interesting to know if there's a consistent species assemblage predicted to correspond with the highest JEV risk. 11. I'm not sure I've seen the results for the relationship between feral pig distribution and JEV risk. I'm not seeing it in Table 1, or in the text, but I see that it had a negative univariate association with JEV risk in Table S2. However, I don't see it in Table S4. Was the decision made to remove it from the list of predictors, even from the full model? If yes, why? Thank you very much for posting such an interesting study, and I'm looking forward to seeing your answers to my questions!

He collected facts and then explored how they might relate. Having already made major additions to these facts, Noboru Sueoka (1995) considered one of Chargaff’s four “rules” – PR2 – in terms of base mutation rates and a “directional mutation pressure,” with little consideration of other facts. With more sequences available, Pflughaupt and Sahakyan (2022) have now extended Sueoka’s work in a “completely assumption free” manner. Supporting Sueoka, their study “reinstates the mutation rates as the major drivers behind the emergence of PR-2.” Furthermore, they have deduced that PR2 gained its universality very early in evolution. This accords well with prior considerations of PR2 using a fact-based approach (Forsdyke 1995). Here an important underlying fact was that effective information systems, whatever their nature, must gain error-correcting ability at an early stage. Accordingly, when seeking to explain introns, it was thought that nucleic acid sequences might contain error-correcting codes (Hamming 1980; Forsdyke 1981). However, as the facts of DNA structure expanded, a genome-wide recombination-based correction process that predicted PR2 compliancy, became more plausible. In a primordial “RNA world” (prior to duplex DNA and PR1) sequences were deemed to be enriched in stem-loop structures capable of mediating error-correction. Into these intron-like sequences, genes would later have been able to elbow their way, and base content would have approached equilibria as Chargaff’s other rules evolved (Forsdyke 2013, 2021). Since some readers of Pflughaupt and Sahakyan (2022) may also read Sueoka (1995), the authors should mention that they use the term “PR2” in the widely accepted historical sense (i.e., it was preceded by “PR1”), rather in the sense used by Sueoka. Furthermore, having downplayed Forsdyke (1995) by citing the works of Chen and Zhao (2005) and Zhang and Huang (2009), they should consider referring readers to his webpage rebuttals (see or search the Wayback Machine (archive-it.org)).

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262v1#comment-6073258005,biorxivstage,2,"Zhan, Deverman and Chan state that, “Our observations suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV.”  The analyses that form the basis for this conclusion are deeply flawed. Figure 1A depicts the early to late phases of SARS-CoV-1 emergence in humans. This phylogenetic tree and subsequent analyses are based on the false premise that SARS-CoV-1 evolution in humans during the early to late phases was monophyletic. The first eleven cases of SARS-CoV were geographically dispersed across a wide area from Foshan to Dongguan in the Pearl River Delta area of southern China and occurred over a 4-month period from November 2002 to March 2003 (1, 2). None of these eleven cases were epidemiologically linked. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that SARS-CoV-1 from these human cases had a common viral ancestor from a human. Indeed, 7/11 of the early cases had documented contact with animals. Subsequent studies indicated that SARS-CoV-1 had already undergone considerable genetic diversification in animals before these first human cases were described (3-8). Genetically diverse SARS-CoV-1 has been found in civets and other animals from southern China as well as in civets from Hubei province where the city of Wuhan is located. The high genetic diversity in the early phase of the outbreak thus reflects multiple independent spillovers of divergent SARS-CoV-1 from animals sold in the wildlife trade (1, 9). This is well-established in the virology literature. The SARS-CoV-1 genetic diversity observed in the early phase of the outbreak is not as the authors imply due to rapid evolution during human-to-human transfer. Contrary to the analyses in Zhan, Deverman and Chan the early and mid-phases of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak were polyphyletic with multiple spillovers and limited expansion of several lineages that were not sustained by further human-to-human passages. This is similar to human infections by Lassa virus (LASV), a hemorrhagic fever virus that is endemic to West Africa (10). Yearly, there are thousands of independent spillovers of LASV from Mastomys natalensis and other rodent intermediates or reservoirs. In a similar manner to the early SARS-CoV-1 isolates, the high genetic diversity of LASV isolated from humans is accounted for its diversity in its rodent reservoirs (11, 12). LASV transmission chains are limited in humans and thus genetic changes occurring in humans are predominantly evolutionary dead ends as were all but one of the early to mid-phase SARS-CoV-1 lineages. Zhan, Deverman and Chan stated that, “we cannot ensure that the early-to-mid epidemic samples did not straddle deep splits in the tree.” In fact, it is abundantly clear that the SARS-CoV-1 Isolates from early cases are indeed from different parts of the SARS-CoV-1 phylogenetic tree. That which the authors present as a caveat is the true explanation for the apparent high level of genetic diversity in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak. However, contrary to the authors’ flawed interpretations the genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-1 was generated in animal intermediates and the undetermined SARS-CoV-1 reservoir prior to multiple spillovers to humans. The late phase of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak is characterized by extended monophyletic spread involving a variant of SARS-CoV-1 that had sustained a 27-nucleotide deletion in orf 8 (13). There is a known index patient, a physician from the HZS-2 Hospital of Guangzhou (14). After being exposed to SARS-CoV-1 at this hospital, he traveled to Hong Kong. During a one-night stay at Hotel ‘M’ in Hong Kong he transmitted SARS-CoV-1 to 16 other guests (15). These individuals seeded outbreaks in Hong Kong, Toronto, Singapore and Vietnam. SARS-CoV-1  continued to spread with minimal genetic variation infecting over 8000 people in 25 countries on five continents and killing at least 774 people. The late phase of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak is reminiscent of the spread of Ebola virus (EBOV), another hemorrhagic fever virus, during a typical outbreak (16, 17). EBOV is transmitted from human-to-human with higher efficiency than LASV. Once a spillover of EBOV occurs there can be spread of the virus over extended human-to human transmission chains.  The genetic diversity of EBOV is considerably less than that of LASV (11). Their comparison of the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 led the authors to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 was well adapted or pre-adapted to replicate in human cells, perhaps in a laboratory. Setting aside the naivety of this argument from a virological perspective, in fact the perceived differences in genetic stability between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are artifactual. The three-month interval used by Zhan, Deverman and Chan for calculations in Figures 1 and 2 is incorrect. The genetic diversification in animals noted above occurred over an undetermined time, but likely a period of years or longer, not months. Therefore, the substitution rates of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 calculated in Figure 1C based on a 3-month interval and the analyses in Figure 2 are not correct. An extensive analysis utilizing a more complete dataset and taking into account progenitor viruses showed that the substitution rates of SARS-CoV-1-like clade varies up to six-fold across the genome, with median rates between 4.0x10-4 and 1.9x10-3 (18). These substitution rates were slightly slower than those of the SARS-CoV-2-like clade a finding at variance with this preprint. While the diversity of SARS-CoV-1 as it spread through various farmed and wild animals is known to be extensive based on available sequences (3-8), there remain gaps in this knowledge. The full extent of SARS-CoV-1 diversity in animals that existed at the time of the human spillovers in 2003-4 remains unknown. In this regard the civet viruses SZ3 and SZ16 found at the Dongmen Market (3) are not the actual progenitors of ""Outbreak 1"" as depicted in Figure 5 of the preprint. The unknown diversity of SARS-CoV-1 in animals effectively precludes assigning any one of several known lineages of SARS-CoV-1 found across a broad geographic range in China to any of the human cases. Civets and other farmed animals in Hubei province are supplied to restaurants across China (19). There must be multiple viral progenitors for what is incorrectly referred to simply as Outbreak 1, which is a composite of multiple spillover events. The lone exception are the four cases with mild illness diagnosed between 16 December 2003 and 8 January 2004 that the authors of the preprint refer to as Outbreak 2.  These cases have definitive epidemiological links to animals sold at the Xinyuan Live Animal Market (20). The authors wrote that “… SARS-CoV-2 appeared without peer in late 2019, suggesting that there was a single introduction of the human-adapted form of the virus into the human population.”  However, Pekar and colleagues (21) provide strong evidence that there were at least two introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into humans. Two lineages designated A and B emerged via the wildlife trade in Wuhan. As was the case with the genetic divergence of early SARS-CoV-1 isolates, diversification of SARS-CoV-2 into lineages A and B occurred in animals. It is pertinent to note that the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in intermediate animals in 2019 appears to have been considerably less than the diversity of SARS-CoV-1 in wildlife in 2002-3. Since the preprint by Zhan, Deverman and Chan was posted in May 2020 it has become clear that SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect numerous other species besides humans (22).  Besides this fact and the flaws discussed above, other flaws may help to explain in part why this preprint has - to date - failed to pass peer-review. For example, the authors wrote, “The only site of notable entropy in the SARS-CoV-2 S, D614G, lies outside of the RBD and is not predicted to impact the structure or function of the protein (34).” However, the D614G mutation has a profound and important impact on the structure and function of the spike shifting it to a mostly open configuration the more effectively binds ACE-2 (23, 24). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 has displayed remarkable “entropy” with the emergence of numerous variants of concern. Despite numerous errors and flawed analyses this preprint continues to be used to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a laboratory origin. For example, the misleading quote in the first sentence above is also found in the Prologue of a mass distribution book co-written by one of the authors (Alina Chan) (25). Matt Ridley, the co-author of that book considered that this preprint was “probably a careful and reputable study.” It is not. Nevertheless, Chan and Ridley continue to promote the false premise that this preprint provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may have been pre-adapted for human transmission in a laboratory (26). The preprint by Zhan, Deverman and Chan contains numerous fundamental flaws. It should be retracted, and the authors should cease promoting the misinformation that it contains. Robert F.

It is poorly described. Petri dishes are ""placed vertically"" -- distance from the source is described but height above the floor is not. I think that by ""vertically""  the authors mean that the surface of the Petri dishes were oriented perpendicular to the floor. This is NOT an appropriate method for assessing aerosol concentrations. Collection using this method is determined by the velocity of air in close proximity to the plates and size and diffusion rates -- not concentration in the air. The apparent protection by high RH may be more an impact on diffusion than actual exposure. The authors should have used a standard method for aerosol collection (e.g., an Andersen Impactor or SKC Biosampler). Phi6 is known to be much less sensitive to UVC than coronavirus when tested in liquid. Given these methodological concerns and failure to assess whether the in-duct UVC system delivered a dose expected to be sufficient to inactivate the test organism, this preprint does not present data that support the conclusions made. The test of UVC was inadequate, poorly described, and only used the least effective type of UVC system on the market, UVC in a box rather than upper room conventional or direct far-UVC. The results regarding RH may be an artifact of the poor air sampling methods used.

Cholesterol in the brain and blood are regulated separately, but influence each other. A hydrophobic statin with a high fat diet may be beneficial early on. The hydrophobic statin would cross into the brain and reduce astrocyte cholesterol and the high fat diet would compensate for some loss of cholesterol in the blood. However, in later stages when the blood brain barrier is open, cholesterol likely comes from blood. In that case, a hydrophilic statin may be better. Statins are also complicated by alterations to prenylation substrates e.g, geranylgeranyl. Prenylation works opposite cholesterol to move protein out of GM1 domains.

I want to thank you for the work that you did in this paper. We had the great opportunity to read and examine the paper in detail and we had come up with a few comments that we would like to offer! For Figure 2A, we noticed that in the UMAP data, there appears to be two separate clusters for Red Blood Cells that are far apart from one another. We were a little confused yet curious to know whether there is an explanation for such separation despite both being the same type of cells. We understand that the main focus of this UMAP was to show the presence of PGCs on embryonic day 50, but seeing the two separate clusters for Red Blood Cells, we couldn’t help but wonder whether the UMAP data were completely accurate. Nevertheless, we understood and appreciated the effort into obtaining this UMAP data showing a cluster for PGCs. For Figure 3B, we thought it would be appropriate to have some explanation within the paper or in the caption of the images to guide our attention to the significance of the brightfield images. While studying the paper, we were a little confused with what the brightfield images were trying to show except that cells aggregated together. Furthermore, since there is already a FACS data at the bottom of the brightfield images that gives readers much more useful information, we wonder whether those brightfield images could be excluded or be added as supplemental figures instead. Overall, we were still very impressed with the efficiency and the success of this induction process from iPSCs straight to cjPGCLCs without inducing into iMeLCs first. For Figure 6C, the arrow in the PCA is camouflaged by the gray background. We thought it would be more appropriate to use a different color for the arrow in order to make the figure clearer and visually appealing. In addition, both Figure 6E and 6F are a little confusing since there are so many lines jumbled together. We believe using a different visual representation may be able to clarify the significance of these two figures. Overall, this was a very impressive paper. We learned a lot and thought it definitely made a lot of significant breakthroughs in the field of generation of primordial germ cells. All the data building from figure 1 to figure 5 have a nice story and flow to it. Figure 6 and 7 disrupt the flow a little, but we understood and appreciate the effort of trying to connect the findings to human significance. Once again, thank you so much for all that work that is put into this study.

I appreciated that there were different types of evidence to support the claims being made and the experimental processes were detailed. This allowed for a good mix of qualitative and quantitative data being offered. A nice variety of visuals were also included in the figures, such as the images of mouse physiology in the extended data and the diagram of PROTOMAP DARTS in figure 2. I also liked that there were rescue of condition experiments and in general there was a considerable increase in the lifespan of male mice, meaning there is a lot of potential for future research. Finally, I did think it was extensive that two different systems of developmental model organisms were used and that these experiments took a considerable amount of time. Additionally, female mice were included in the study and all organisms were inspected daily to reduce the chance of confounding variables. I do think this paper could be made even stronger with some reorganizing and adding sections to separate the paper, ex: Introduction, Results, Discussion etc. Furthermore, some additional discussion to emphasize why this focus should be important to us would be helpful. As for statistical improvements, post-hoc tests could be added, and using power analysis or statistical tests to determine sample sizes would have been useful. Sample sizes were also really small with female mice specifically. Explaining the reason for the threshold of the False Discovery Rate would be helpful as well as including it in the figures. As for figure explanations, in terms of mitochondrial “perturbation”, additional context on if this is negative or positive change would be appreciated. In figure legends, it was hard to tell why some terminology was red and why some was black. There was a missing loading control in figure 3D and no quantification of figure 3E. Additionally, sex comparisons in mice could have been more comprehensive.

I wanted to thank you for your work in this paper, as our journal club gained a lot from reading and presenting it this quarter. As part of the group that chose your paper to delve deeper into, I had a couple of suggestions that our class felt would make your paper even better. Firstly, while reading the paper, our class was slightly confused as to why you decided to focus only on miRNA 106b-5p, when Figure 5I showed that there was a significant decrease in glucose uptake within cells transfected with mimics of both 106b-5p and Let7g-5p. Our class felt that explaining this choice further in the paper would go a long way in understanding the role that specifically 106b-5p played. Did Let7g-5p also increase in expression at lower levels of serum vitamin D? Additionally, while the methodology of this paper was very impressive, our class found that since there were no diagrams relaying methodological information it was rather difficult to find all of the information needed to contextualize each experiment. While the text explains the connections between all of the downstream effects of Jarid2 suppression due to vitamin D deficiency, some sort of comprehensive flow-chart or diagram would be very helpful for reading while trying to understand your work. Thank you so much again for making your work available for us to read. I found your work to be highly inspiring and our class had a great time deconstructing this paper!",2022-12-13T22:09:12,,Eesha Chattopadhyay,10.1101/2022.09.08.507174,Embryonic Vitamin D Deficiency Programs Hematopoietic Stem Cells to Induce Type 2 Diabetes,"Jisu Oh, Amy E.

To answer your question, in our assays, we did not observe any worm where only one of the two phasmids dye-filled. All the phasmids that we observed from both the control and our mutant worms filled with DiI. The preliminary dye-filling experiments were performed many times. The reason that we  had a low sample size was because the dye-filled worms were not analyzed with a simple dissecting scope in our experiments, as is often the convention with dye-filling assays. We were unable to analyze our dye-filled worms using a dissecting microscope because, unfortunately, our dissecting scope does not have the capability to allow us to visualize dye-filled worms. Therefore, all our images were high-resolution images that were taken with a spinning disk confocal microscope at a 60X magnification. So, we had to immobilize each worm on an agar pad prior to checking them on the scope. Due to the tediousness of this task, and since we did not observe any differences in dye-filling between our control and mutant worms in our preliminary experiments, we felt that crossing the mutation into a pan-ciliary marker strain would be a more thorough experiment to assay for cilia defects. PISA stands for ""Present in SAS-6"".

Autzen. Summary Dalal et al. investigates the structural consequences that various lipid nanodisc systems have on a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) from Erwinia (ELIC). The authors solved four structures of agonist-bound ELIC reconstituted in styrene-maleic acid (SMA), circularized Spycatcher-Spytag membrane scaffold protein (spMSP), and saposin and apo-ELIC5 (a non-desensitized mutant) reconstituted in spMSP using single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The authors compare these four cryo-EM structures with previously solved nanodisc structures of the same protein(s) and find that different nanodisc systems produce different ELIC conformations. They conclude that “the nanodisc scaffold affects the structure of ELIC and this effect likely relates, in part, to nanodisc size”. They use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to further substantiate this conclusion. The aim of the study is of great relevance for the assessment of meaningfulness of cryo-EM structures of membrane proteins reconstituted in various nanodisc systems, which has become a central approach for solving many different classes of membrane proteins. This was also one of our primary motivations for discussing the manuscript in class. As such, in its current form, the manuscript is difficult to read and primarily of interest to biochemists and structural biologists specifically working on pentameric ligand-gated ion channels in vitro. The evidence that the observed structural differences of ELIC can be ascribed to the different environments is primarily based on the cryo-EM structures. As it is not entirely clear to what extent the vitrification process influences the structures of ion channels, it is relevant to further substantiate these observations with biophysical studies performed in vitro in this or later studies of ELIC to appreciate if it is a general trend or only pertains to ELIC. Below we outline some questions and comments that the authors might consider when revising the manuscript. Several of our comments are centered on the presentation of data, which are missing details if this work is to target a broader audience than the manuscript in its present form does. Comments and Questions 1)	The authors solve ELIC in SMA-stabilized discs, generated from ELIC proteoliposomes composed by POPC:POPE:POPG, starting with DDM-solubilized ELIC. A huge advantage of the SMA technology is that it can be used for detergent-free solubilization of membrane proteins in what has been coined “native nanodiscs”. We realize that the workflow taken by the authors enables better comparison between different nanodisc systems, keeping the starting material and the lipid composition constant; however, we cannot help but wonder why the authors didn’t also attempt to purify ELIC in SMA directly from E. coli membranes to address whether this part of the preparation has an effect on the conformation. Considering previous studies indicating that ELIC is dependent on its lipid composition, it is relevant to address which influence native lipids will have on the conformation downstream. Importantly, the proteoliposome approach which was used to prepare SMA-ELIC should be directly stated in the main text such that the reader immediately knows that the SMA-ELIC structure has seen detergent. 2)	In extension of the above point, we also wonder why the authors did not attempt to vary the lipid composition in the reconstituted systems to probe their influence, or at the very least included a discussion of such effects. We of course recognize that including additional structural studies would have made the study even more extensive than it already is. 3)	We find it challenging to understand exactly what the pore radii of each ELIC conformational state mean. The authors show in Figure 1 and 2 that the radius of the pore changes, but it is hard to follow what exactly this means in terms of gating. How narrow does the pore have to be for it to effectively be occluded? We assume that the central residue distances are those highlighted in Figure 1 (16’ (F247), 9’ (L240), and 2’ (Q233)), however, what is the significance of 16’, 9’ if 2’ is the gate? This is hard to follow for a non-ELIC/pLIC expert. 4)	The authors state that “The nanodisc structure for SMAELIC was too disordered to measure” (line 106). At this time, it is not possible to review the cryo-EM maps (nor the PDB modes associated with them) as these are all withheld from publication, so it is difficult to understand why it was not possible to carry out the analysis on this map following the same procedure as for the other maps as Figure 1 shows a density for the nanodisc similar to the other structures. 5)	According to Suppl. Figure 4, the sidechain of Lys?? lies outside of the shown map density. The authors should reconsider whether or not modelling the sidechains of Lys?? in the SMAELIC model is fair based on their data. 6)	The authors are quite sparse in terms of introducing the reader to their model system, ELIC. For instance: Where is it from, where is it expressed, what activates it, what is its selectivity, and how relevant are studies on ELIC(5) to pLICs from other species? An explanation of this would allow the reader to appreciate the significance of the presented findings further. 7)	In extension of the above, the agonist is not properly introduced. It is only indirectly mentioned that propylamine is the agonist in the main text. 8)	The authors use a mutated form of ELIC - ELIC5 - to represent the optimal activated conformation. The authors should explain why they can use ELIC5 as the “true” activated conformation of ELIC. 9)	The authors should provide a SEC trace of the SMA ELIC sample. This seems to be missing from Suppl. Figure 3a and b. 10)	There are two large peaks in the SEC traces of the saposin sample in Suppl. Figure 3a. We assume the peak around 15 mL is saposin alone, but this is not clear from the text. 11)	The authors should provide SDS-page gels of all their samples to showcase their purity. 12)	The authors should explain why global superposition is the best option for their structural analysis. 13)	The authors should consider stating if and how their MD simulations are limited in terms of sampling, e.g., is it enough to do single MD simulations of each system or should they have performed several runs of the same systems? 14)	Figure 7 shows that the bilayer thickness for both 9 and 11 nm nanodiscs increases at the largest distance measured from the TMDs. This trend should be explained. The language in the manuscript is good, however, there are minor details throughout that would tighten it up: 15)	The presentation of the results is somewhat confusing. For instance, in lines 73-100, the authors should clarify what findings are part of this study and what are contained in previous studies. Furthermore, a thorough introduction to the different nanodiscs and why they were selected is missing; The authors could consider including an overview of estimated sizes that different nanodisc systems typically support early on in the text. This would ease the understanding of the MD analysis later in the text, which mainly deals with the diameter of the systems, in addition to the estimated nanodisc sizes from the cryo-EM data. 16)	The reader could benefit from Figure 1 showcasing the structures solved in the current paper only, in addition to the proposed conformational states of ELIC in a schematic (Figure 4e could be included in Figure 1). 17)	It is hard to get a good overview of the main findings of the paper. One way to improve the structure of the text, the authors could consider presenting their results with more conclusive headlines. E.g., the header in line 172 (“Different nanodisc scaffolds produce a range of agonist-bound conformations”) is too general and would also be applicable to findings included in the previous paragraph and the headers in line 200 and 249 do not mention the main finding of the following paragraph. 18)	Lines 76-80 cites original literature dealing with the channel opening of ELIC, however, it is hard to follow what “greater” and “quite high” means here, particularly as the literature cited is supposedly rather quantitative, e.g., “saturating concentrations of agonist in HEK membranes has been estimated to be > 0.96”. 19)	Another statement that is diffuse and should be elaborated upon is “The measured diameter of the cryo-EM density of nanodisc scaffolds”. The criteria used for this measurement should be explained here in brief or at the very least refer to Methods. 20)	Cryo-EM should be introduced as an abbreviation when it first appears (line 32 and 46). 21)	It should be clear when the authors are referring to reviews and not primary literature (e.g., “as reviewed in”). 22)	Domain names (e.g., ECD and TMD) should be introduced early on in the figures. It is hard to follow the analysis pertaining the helices M1-M4 as it is not explicated stated anywhere that a protomer is composed by four helices. 23)	In extension of the above, in lines 210 – 214, they authors discuss the structures and the altering of “loop C” without showing the location of the named region properly. 24)	Figure 4: The agonist in gray spheres in panel a and d is not helpful for the analysis. Panels f and g seem repetitive. 25)	Coloring the sidechains of residues in Figure 2c with elements (red oxygens, blue nitrogens) would help the reader interpret this figure. 26)	The MD simulations of the bilayer system is not properly introduced in the text, nor described in enough detail in the Methods section for the reader to understand this system, which makes it hard to follow the comparisons in the text. 27)	Some of the Figure legends contains errors and should be double checked, for instance, Figure 4 shows a panel B, but its description is missing. 28)	The authors should consider stating why only spMSP1D1 was subjected to MD simulations and not the other systems. 29)	Figure 5 seems less important and could be included in Suppl. Same goes for Figure 7. 30)	Figure 7: The chosen color scheme in Figure 7b is confusing considering red and blue denotes the two systems in panel 7a and in Figure 6.",2022-12-12T07:34:34,henrietteautzen,Henriette Autzen,10.1101/2022.11.20.517256,Lipid nanodisc scaffold and size alters the structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel,"Vikram Dalal, Mark J.

The authors modelled a missense allele sas-6(L69T) that is associated with primary microcephaly. This allele did not cause embryonic lethality but did cause ciliogenesis defects. This study is an excellent example of how modelling missense patient variants can help to elucidate specific functions of these genes and better our understanding of disease mechanisms. The lack of dye filling defect caught my interest. This section is very carefully worded to state that no worms were observed “that completely excluded DiI in their phasmid neurons”. Was there a partial dye filling defect? For example, did only 1 or 2 phasmid neurons dyefill? The small sample sizes of ~25 worms suggest only one replicate was performed. It may be worth investigating further. While this does not change the findings of this paper, if more variants of sas-6 are modelled in the future dye filling is the easiest/fastest assay to screen large numbers of variants. The authors mention that the L69T mutation is located in a conserved PISA motif.

I really enjoyed your paper about alpha-ketobutyrate effects on lifespan and healthspan in C. elegans and mice. I thought the results were fascinating! I thought your experiments were well laid out and supported your claims. I also appreciated how you provided qualitative and quantitative data and included two model organisms. Here are some general comments I have about your paper. I think it could be helpful to split the paper up more by different sections, like materials and methods, discussion, etc, to make it more organized. In regards to your figures, I think it would be helpful to include the data being statistically significant and the p-value. For example, I really liked how figure 4 did this and I think it could be useful for the other figures as well. Additionally, I think it could be helpful to explain why you chose your sample sizes, such as figure 1. You suggest that you included the sample size because of previous research so it would be helpful to cite this research or even perform a power analysis to justify your sample size. I really appreciate how you included male and female mice in your study. Additionally, I appreciated how you still included female mice in your studies on healthspan even though there was not a statistically significant increase in lifespan for these mice. In regards to figure 4e, I think it would be helpful to perform this study on male mice as well. It was interesting how alpha-ketobutyrate was able to decrease the decline of motility for female mice; however, it would be interesting to investigate if these results are also applicable to male mice, as you have displayed in this study, there is a difference between male and female mice. Additionally, I noticed how male and female mice were grouped together in 4f when studying hepatology. As the other experiments separated the two by sex, I also think it would be helpful to keep them separated when studying this. I noticed how there was only one female mouse included in this study so it would be helpful to include a larger sample size if possible. Overall, I found your paper really interesting!

There are many pieces of data that will serve as very important information for this field. I greatly appreciated the abundance of figures in this paper. Each figure provided relevant information for the primary question of how vasopressin is correlated to the regulation of osmolarity. I also appreciated the use of various methods to validate results. For example, both immunofluorescence staining and western blots were conducted to give qualitative and quantitative data. With this being said, there are a few suggestions that I would like to contribute. One concern that I have in relation to Figure 3. Parts a and b of figure 3 are very well done. I appreciated that there was a quantification and statistical analysis of the protein levels found in the western blot. I realized that there was no quantification and statistical analysis that accompanied that immunofluorescence staining. This would be a beneficial addition because it would be a mathematical representation of the significance of your data. An additional concern I have is with Figure 9 and other figures counting human data. Although the understanding on how vasopressin is correlated to the regulation of osmolarity, it seems that compared with the other data provided in the paper, the human data still needs to be improved. In Figure 9, it is difficult to fully conclude that there is the localization of pre-pro-vasopressin and Rab3 but by the images provided. A numerical way to quantify localization may be a beneficial addition.",2022-12-08T17:53:57,heidiburi,HEIDI BURI,10.1101/2022.05.13.491898,Kidney collecting duct cells make vasopressin in response to NaCl induced hypertonicity,"Juan Pablo Arroyo, Andrew S.

We are aware that the sequence learning literature focuses on learning of new motor sequences, where learning is usually quantified by speed and accuracy. Our study does not involve such a sequence learning task. However, we think that the term “sequence of movements” is adequate for our study since participants did perform movements in sequence. We believe, that the repeated execution of the same sequences is central to the adaptation we observe. In the next version of the manuscript, we will state more explicitly how we are using the term “sequence of movements"" and how it deviates from the common understanding in sequence learning literature. 2. Yes, we treat the perpendicular error and force measure differently. A reason for not baseline correcting the force measure is that we have a lot fewer trials measuring the force as compared to the perpendicular error. The average of only two trials in the last baseline block might not adequately reflect the average prior learning performance. We will, however, perform the suggested analysis and mention it in addition to our present force measure analysis. 3. Good idea, we will include the equation of the model in the manuscript's next version. 4. Of course, we cannot conclude from a near-significant p-value that there is no effect. We agree that we should have worded the results of the mentioned comparisons more carefully and will do so in the next version of our manuscript. However, our main conclusion is evident even by just looking at the plotted data (trajectories in figure 4 or perpendicular error over time in figure 6A): clearly, a prior other arm visual or passive movement is not as effective in allowing motor adaptation as an active other arm prior movement. Whether a visual/passive prior movement still allows some adaptation and whether we have enough evidence to judge if there is a difference between the two groups is certainly questionable and should be studied further. 5. Our analysis concerning transfer of learning is arguably not ideal. The initial idea was based on our expectation that visual and passive prior movements would be similarly effective as active prior movements (with similar states after the washout period). With the limited learning occurring in the visual and passive group we think that there is not a lot one can learn from our transfer condition. Nevertheless, we decided to include it in the manuscript. What we can observe is that performance is not worse in the re-adaptation compared to the end of adaptation phase like it is in the active group. In the active group, the washout phase in between is of course a reason for the worse performance in the re-adaptation phase. This observation underlines that not a lot of learning occurred in the perceptual groups when even after a washout phase performance during re-adaptation is not worse than performance at the end of adaptation. A second (perhaps rather observational) takeaway is that it does not look like learning the active sequence (that is the prior movement and the corresponding adapted reach to the final target) was enhanced by the prior exposure of the sequence with a prior “perceptual movement”. Regardless of the precise adaptation state after the washout phase, one would have expected a steeper learning curve (and therefore a smaller overall average) in the re-adaptation phase. 6. We computed the force with the help of a function as provided by Kinarm (KINARM_add_hand_kinematics: ""The hand forces calculated here are the commanded hand forces as would have been ‘commanded’ to the KINARM robot and are based on the torques applied to the robot”). Hence, we are measuring the force that was generated by the Kinarm to make the hand of the participants stay in the force channels. In our next version of the manuscript, we will describe this measure in greater detail. Thanks for bringing this to our attention. In general, channel trials in the Exoskeleton Kinarm were indeed a challenge: making the channel walls too stiff resulted in the Kinarm vibrating. After consultation with the Kinarm team, we found settings which worked for our purpose (including choosing the direction to the left from the central target as the clamp trial direction). The trajectories in the clamp trials were generally straight, but deviations of up to ~1cm were possible. This means we are likely underestimating adaptation performance with our measure. We do not think this is problematic because this affects all groups.",2022-12-06T13:44:20,magda_gippert,Magdalena Gippert,10.1101/2022.11.22.517483,Prior movement of one arm facilitates motor adaptation in the other,"M.

I selected your paper for a journal club presentation this quarter and I really enjoyed learning from it and sharing it with my class. We all appreciated how thorough and well-designed these experiments were, the claims made in the paper were all supported by multiple strong lines of evidence. As my group and I read the paper, we had a few suggestions to share with you. In Figure 2B, protein abundance of the kidney derived and brain derived pre-pro-vasopressin would have been helpful to quantitatively compare the vasopressin levels from each organ. In Figure 4, I would have appreciated some quantitative analysis of the amount of colocalized Rab3 and pre-pro-vasopressin relative to pre-pro-vasopressin on its own in order to compare the difference between the basolateral, mid-section, and apical levels of the IMCDs. The methods used in Figure 5 were very creative and the results were compelling and interesting to read! A figure legend or explanation of the 5 different wells in the Western blot conducted in Figure 8A would make these data more clear. On a broader scale, I think this paper would be strengthened with a more thorough examination of pre-pro-vasopressin made in human kidneys. The sequence of mature vasopressin is the same between humans and mice, so the same assay used in Figure 5 could also be used to detect if vasopressin synthesized by human kidneys is also active. Additionally, using female mice in addition to male mice would increase the power and scope of these experiments. I’m excited to see future studies on this topic and the physiological impact and relevance of kidney-derived vasopressin!

The authors claim that the travelling waves or “alpha echoes” reported in the EEG literature might instead be explained by two sources mixing at scalp level. We read this manuscript with great interest and here provide some feedback that came up in our discussion of this work. The study is interesting and thepaper is clearly written. While experimental design and MEG preprocessing weredescribed in detail, some methodological decisions remained a bit unclear to us, especially with regard to the TRF analysis and the model construction. We thought it would be relevant in light of the research question to compare the ‘two source model’ and the ‘travelling wave model’ via simulations to see which one best explains the empirical results. Furthermore, it would be helpful to justify the choice of TRF analysis decisions. Specifically, TRFs here would be suitable to calculate the reconstruction accuracy of the proposed model in a cross-validation procedure, which would further allow a direct comparison of a potential ‘travelling wave model’ with the ‘two source model’. We were unclear on why a Pearson’s r correlation analysis was used instead. In general, we think it would be helpful to provide more details about the statistical analyses. For example, in the Results section (lines 216-218) it is concluded that there was “a systematic spatial decay of the TFR peak amplitude observed at around 200 ms, and the decay of the amplitudes with distance was nearly linear (p < 10-12)”. What analysis was conducted to assess this? It is mentioned that unlike EEG, a posterior to frontal travelling wave is not observed. Could this be related to the fact that frontal sources were not included in the analysis? In Figure 5, it would be helpful to plot the frequency spectrum of the two regions of interest. Do these regions show the same alpha rhythm or do they differ in their spectral characteristics (e.g., peak frequency)? In the Introduction and Discussion (line 321), three models are mentioned, but there is a fourth model1,2,3,4 that is not mentioned and could also explain the results (see reference list below). Minor comments and questions: -In several instances TFR is written instead of TRF. - It would be helpful to plot the power spectrum of the areas that show temporal response functions. Do they have an alpha peak? Does this correspond to the peak of the TRF? -In Figure 2, how is the group-level plot generated? -Labels of colorbars are missing throughout the figures. -Please report the mean number of trials used for the analysis (after the random selection).

Zerze Reviewed by F. Emil Thomasen and Kresten Lindorff-Larsen Comments: The preprinted manuscript by Zerze reports on molecular dynamics simulations of the intrinsically disordered low complexity domain (LCD) of FUS using a beta version of the coarse-grained force field Martini 3. The author performed simulations to study the formation of FUS LCD condensates under varying protein-water interaction strengths (in the Martini force field) and at different NaCl concentrations, and concludes that strengthening protein-water interactions by a factor of 1.03 improves the agreement with experimental transfer free energies between the dilute and dense phases. Additionally, the author concludes that the NaCl concentration affects condensate morphology and protein-protein interactions in the condensate, and that the effect of NaCl concentration on protein-protein interactions in the condensate is sensitive to rescaling of the protein-water interactions. The preprint provides an interesting and novel benchmark of the (beta) Martini 3 model in predicting phase separation of IDPs, and reveals potential short-comings of the model in predicting protein concentrations in (or volumes of) the condensed and dilute phases. This benchmark will be useful for readers who wish to simulate liquid-liquid phase separation of IDPs with Martini 3, and the work will be interesting to a wider audience interested in the biophysics of IDPs and their condensates. Below we outline some questions and comments that the author might take into account when revising the manuscript. Our main comment regards a clearer assessment of the convergence of the simulations and correspondingly the lack of error estimates for observables calculated from the simulations. We also suggest a clearer presentation of the experimental data used to validate the simulations. While some of these changes are mostly textual, in other cases we suggest additional simulations. We realize that some of these simulations require substantial resources; if these are beyond what is available, we suggest at least to clarify caveats as per the points below. We have the following suggestions for revisions to the manuscript: 1) Fig. 1 and 2: The finding of non-spherical droplets is interesting and intriguing. To examine whether the formation of these shapes in the simulations with higher salt and λ-values represent stable states or perhaps trapped metastable states of the system, we suggest that: 1a) The author runs simulations with the parameters that give rise to non-spherical morphologies (e.g. λ=1.025 and 50 mM NaCl) starting from the structure of the spherical droplet (for example formed with λ=1.0 and no salt) and observe whether the non-spherical morphology is recovered or the droplet remains stable. If the droplet remains stable, then the effect of salt concentration on the inter-chain contacts (Fig. 6) could be assessed without potentially confounding factors from different dense phase morphologies. 1b) The author shows time-series or distributions of an observable that reports on the dynamics of the proteins in the non-spherical droplet (e.g. Rg, mean square displacement, residue-residue contacts) and/or of an observable that reports on the dynamics of the droplet shape (e.g. the x-, y-, and z-components of the gyration tensor). 1c) Additionally, independent replicas of droplet formation for each condition and parameter set would be ideal, but we realize that this would be expensive in computational resources and may be infeasible. 2) “As λ increases, the volume of the dense phase increases (and condensed phase concentration decreases accordingly) until the system is not capable of forming a dense phase (λ >1.03)”: From Fig. 1 it seems that the rate of cluster formation decreases as λ increases. Is it not then possible that droplet formation at λ>1.03 is stable at equilibrium, but occurs on time-scales greater than those tested in the simulations? To support the statement that no droplets are stable at λ>1.03, we suggest that the author runs simulations with a higher value of λ starting from the structure of the spherical droplet (formed with λ=1.0 and no salt) to observe whether the droplet is dissolved or remains stable. 3) Figure 3: The use of the radial distribution does not seem ideal for the droplets that have a non-spherical morphology, as certain distances will report on an average over the dense and dilute phases. This should at a minimum be discussed. 4) Table 1: It seems that the discrepancy between the sigmoidal fit approach and the surface reconstruction approach increases with λ, possibly due to sensitivity to the shape of the droplets, illustrating that there might be significant uncertainty associated with the reported dense phase volumes. We think it would be useful to have an error estimate for the reported dense phase volumes (e.g. an error over volume calculation approaches and/or over different probe sizes). 5) Table 2 and Fig. 4: We suggest that the author more explicitly states which experimental data was used for comparison with the simulations in Fig. 4. We also suggest a more direct comparison with experimental data points where possible (e.g. by showing the experimental values of csat as a function of NaCl concentration). 6) “We used the “tiny” bead type (TQ1) both for Na+ and Cl- ions”: The author should clarify the reason for and possible effects of choosing the TQ1 bead type, as TQ5 is, we think, the standard bead type for Na+ and Cl- ions in Martini 3. 7) We suggest that the author, where possible, reports error estimates for the various observables, for example from block error analysis and/or repeated simulations. 8) It would be useful to include a discussion of the effects of simulation convergence and simulation starting configurations on the reported results. 9) A discussion of the potential differences in the effect of non-bonded cut-offs in the dilute and dense phase would also be useful. 10) It would be very useful if the inputs/settings (including starting configurations) used for simulation and code for analysis were available. We also have the following suggestions for minor changes to the manuscript: 1) “We kept the protein-protein interactions unmodified (and no additional elastic backbone constraints were applied)”: The author should clarify whether this includes assignment of secondary structure and/or side chain angle and dihedral restraints (ss and scfix in Martinize). 2) “All simulations were performed using GROMACS MD engine (version 2016.3).”: Error in references. 3) In the Cluster Formation Analysis section: We suggest that the author cites the specific package used (e.g. SciPy). 4) Fig. 2: There are small red dots on the droplets, which should either be explained in the figure text or removed. 5) Fig. 3: It would be useful for the reader if the NaCl concentration was labelled at the top of each column. Additionally, the radial distribution of the ion concentration is shown as two separate rows, which we assume corresponds to Na+ and Cl- ions. This should be clearly labelled. 6) “We found the largest water fraction For the ionic species…”: Typo? 7) Fig. 4: Depending on how the plot is updated with more details on the experiments, perhaps the range shown on the y-axis could be made smaller. 8) Fig. 5: May be clearer with a colourmap with three colours, as in figure 6.",2022-11-27T12:46:31,krestenlindorfflarsen,Kresten Lindorff-Larsen,10.1101/2022.11.07.515502,Optimizing the Martini 3 force field reveals the effects of the intricate balance between protein-water interaction strength and salt concentration on biomolecular condensate formation,Gül H.

This review reflects comments provided by the following students (in alphabetical order by last name) : Michelle Chong, Eleazar DeAlmeida, J. Carlos Gomez, Deannakayte Marucut, Liz Mathiasen, Raquel Reyes, Karina Rodriguez, Abdellah Shraim, Matt Suntay, Yaqoub Yusuf Comments and review compiled by Dr. Ashley Albright To understand the role of kinases in the origins of multicellularity and animal development, the authors conducted a small molecule screen of kinase inhibitors in choanoflagellates, the closest living relatives of animals. Genetic tools in choanoflagellates, as well as other emerging model systems are limited. This approach using small molecule inhibitors rather than genetic tools to screen for phenotypic changes will not only be invaluable for choanoflagellate researchers, but researchers using other organisms as well. The authors found that sorafenib, a p38 kinase inhibitor, inhibits choanoflagellate cell proliferation. Furthermore, S. rosetta p38 is activated by environmental stressors (heat and oxidative stress), suggesting a conserved role for p38 kinases. Ultimately, the results of this study show that small molecule screens are a valuable approach to understand biology in emerging model systems, especially when available tools are limited. Students in our course come from a variety of scientific backgrounds, and many are new to reading scientific papers. Therefore, our comments focus on readability and significance more so than methodology and strength of results. Comments: 1. While we appreciate the conciseness of the introduction, we felt that the authors could provide additional information on the background of choanoflagellate research and why they are used as a model organism. The authors do mention, “Choanoflagellates possess homologs of diverse animal kinases (Figure S1) (9–11) and due to their phylogenetic placement are relevant for reconstructing the ancestral functions of animal cell signaling proteins (12, 13).” However, we believe the connection between choanoflagellate research and the origins of multicellularity could be more explicit. 2. Similar to the comment above, we felt that the authors could provide more background information on small molecule phenotypic screens and limited genetic tools. We understand the benefit that they provide in cases where genetic tools are limited, but how are the tools limited in choanoflagellates exactly? We are also curious about other small molecule screens. Why were kinases targeted in this case? 3. The results were described in great detail, making interpretations of the data easier for people outside of the field; however, we feel that the connection between results and conclusion in some cases were less clear. As an example, the authors state: “These findings showed that glesatinib disrupts both cell proliferation and tyrosine kinase signaling. Together these observations provide independent support for the hypothesis that kinase signaling regulates cell proliferation in choanoflagellates.” How exactly does tyrosine kinase signaling relate to cell proliferation compared to other kinase signaling? 4. The authors report that effects of sorafenib on cell proliferation are dose-dependent. We would like to know if this response is density-dependent as well. Other Thoughts and Questions: 1. Would this approach yield similar results in other species of choanoflagellates? Other protists? Basal animals? Plants? 2. We would like to see these experiments repeated for other hit compounds. 3. The authors mention that this approach is normally used in drug discovery, how does what was discovered through this screen relate to human disease?",2022-11-23T19:46:10,ashley_albright,Ashley Albright,10.1101/2022.08.26.505350,A small molecule screen reveals the essentiality of p38 kinase for choanoflagellate cell proliferation,"Florentine U.N.

The authors identify a family of 6 type 2c protein phosphates in the blast fungus by homology with orthologues from S. cerevisae and C. albicans. They have generated two gene deletion strains of the family, PTC1 and PTC2. These mutants have been suggested to have role in cell-wall integrity which could occur through the negative regulation of MAPKs, Pmk1, Osm1 and Mps1. Additionally, PTC1 is shown to associate with the protein adaptor Nbp2 which might mediate the interaction with the MAPKs. Also, they localise some members of this family at different developmental stages of rice blast disease, showing PTCs accumulate at different sub cellular compartments. This suggests the different roles of these proteins during rice blast disease. The authors propose Ptc1 and Ptc2 regulate major MAPK signalling pathways in the blast fungus, such as Pmk1 which is a major regulator of pathogenicity. However, there is no evidence/discussion related to pathogenicity for Ptc1 and Ptc2 null mutants. Furthermore, the article lacks of experimental data from the major conclusions and there are gaps in addressing the rational of the narrative. Figure 1 Phylogenetic tree is needed to dissect the family of PCTs in M. oryzae. It would be good to include orthologues of S. cerevisae, C. albincans and other filamentous fungi in this analysis. Figure 2 q-RT-PCR analysis in appressorium samples during development should be added to support the conclusion that PTCs are important at this stage of infection. q-RT-PCR results alone are not enough to support the idea of PTC1 and PTC2 regulate stress responses. The title of figure 2 should be more specific to the result because ionic stress is the only one affecting the expression of PTCs. MoPTC7 shows to be significant in the graphs but this is not discussed. Authors did not specify why they exclude MoPTC8 from these experiments. Colours in the graphs are difficult to differentiate. From these results, authors do not justify why they only follow up on PTC1 and PTC2. Figure 3 Cell-wall integrity was only studied by measuring the colony growth rate. Microscopy using cell wall markers in both null mutant and wild type strains could help to investigate their role as cell wall determinants. Complemented version of the mutants do not seem to restore the phenotype in the data presented, therefore pictures are not representative of the results. Figure 4 Expression of Pmk1, Osm1 and Mps1 in analysed in mycelium. However, because the role of these MAPK is primarily during appressorium morphogenesis, it would be better to analyse tissue extracted from different appressorium development stages. To show consistency between blots, authors could have included anti-actin antiserum for Mps1 and Pmk1. Additionally, an antibody to analyse endogenous levels of Oms1 is needed. Authors could have also included null mutants of Pmk1, Osm1 and Mps1 as control. Figure 5 The title and conclusions are not supported with the shown data because Pmk1 and Osm1 do not directly interact with PTC1. The authors do not discuss why PTC2 is not analysed for interaction assays. Several controls are missing in this figure: protein expression levels in Y2H experiments should be validated by western blot analysis, internal biological positive and negative interaction controls should be included (apart from the technical controls of the system, pGBKT7-53/pGADT7-T and pGBKT7-Lam/pGADT7-T). Positive and negative controls for figures E and F are needed, just like it is done for figure D. Figure 6 The final microscopy includes various PTCs, excluding PTC7 and PTC8 with no further explanation. Authors might consider to show this results at the beginning of the article when introducing the family of PTCs in M. Oryzae. Typo PTC3 instead of PTC2 in figure legend. Figure 7 The proposed model is visually complex to understand, PTC2 role is unclear in the network and there is not enough evidence to say PTC2 negatively regulated Pmk1 and Msp1.

The authors should be commended on the pre-registration of their experiment. Major comments: 1. Throughout the paper, the authors refer to sequence of movements, which many people will find misleading as this seems to refer to sequence learning literature while no sequences are learned in the paper. 2. the two outcomes measured are treated differently. While the perpendicular error is corrected for baseline bias, the force measured during error-clamp trials is not. This has traditionally been the case in the force-field literature. Alternatively, the authors could compare the force exerted at the end of the adaptation period with the force exerted during the last block of baseline. 3. It would be nice to provide the equation of the statistical model used for the mixed model as different 4. Non-significant p-values should be treated more carefully. For instance, on line 387-388, the authors mentioned two non-significant p-values (p=0.0625 and p=0.0703) and conclude on the absence of effect. Same for line 399. Does p=0.1 really means that there is no difference. This problem is partially caused by the tiny sample size of the three bimanual groups (N=8). This also prevents us from estimating the effect size with high certainty. 5. I don't understand how the analysis of Fig.6F can tell us anything about transfer of adaptation. You compare blocks 46-50 of the adaptation periods to blocks 1-5 of re-adaptation. What does this difference mean? There is also absolutely no information about the performance just before re-adaptation. Are people really back to baseline in all groups? Fig.6A and B suggest that this is not the case.In that case, I don't think that it is possible assess the transfer of learning because people are re-adapting from an unknown state. 6. It was my understanding that the Kinarm Exoskeleton was not enough stiff to perform reliable channel trials. Could you provide information about how straight the channel trials were ? In addition, the force during channel trials are usually measured by a force transducer placed on the handle. How was the force computed here? How did you go form the force exerted at the elbow and shoulder joint to the force exerted at the end?",2022-11-23T13:48:58,disqus_Obrwp25I6P,JJ,10.1101/2022.11.22.517483,Prior movement of one arm facilitates motor adaptation in the other,"M.

I believe installation from source is possible, but the exact installation commands on this page do not work for R version 4.1.2. Thank you for informing me about what you have encountered with the STAR splice junctions.  I see some discussion of overlapping reads here, but I have started a new ticket to try and understand the situation better.  In the test case that I created, I could not see the exact same issue.  However, now that the ticket has been created, others might be able to provide a better test example?  I have usually found the feedback provided though GitHub for STAR to be useful, so I hope that helps. Also, as I understand it, I apologize for some delay on my end as well.
