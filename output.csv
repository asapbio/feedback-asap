Sorry for delayed response because I did not receive alerts from Biorxiv. In this manuscript, we provided extensive Western blot and IF data to show that phosphorylated RPB1 is not dephosphorylated but rather degraded at protein level during natural NSN-to-SN transition. We agree that transcriptional inhibitor with THZ1 and DRB1 can mimic the action of RPB1 degradation in the sense that they could also dissociate RPB1 from chromatin but without inducing degradation, and hence inducing transition. This action is likely independent of transcription inhibition because blocking transcription inhibition with adenosine analogs without inducing RPB1 dissociation is insufficient to induce transition.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.01.543127v2#comment-6525793762,biorxivstage,2,"The second part of the summary of revisions follows below: Recognition of pits Referee 3 and 4 and several additional commentators have emphasized that the recognition of pit features is necessary to the hypothesis of burial, and questioned whether the data presented in the manuscript were sufficient to demonstrate that pits were present. We have revised the manuscript in several ways to clarify how all the different kinds of evidence from the subsystem test the hypothesis that pits were present. This includes the presentation of a minimal definition of burial to include a pit dug by hominins, criteria for recognizing that a pit was present, and an evaluation of the evidence in each case to make clear how the evidence relates to the presence of a pit and subsequent infill. As referee 3 notes, it can be challenging to recognize a pit when sediment is relatively homogeneous. This point was emphasized in the review by Pomeroy and coworkers (2020b), who reflected on the difficulty seeing evidence for shallow pits constructed by hominins, and we have cited this in the main text. As a result, the evidence for pits has been a recurrent topic of debate for most Pleistocene burial sites. However in addition to the sedimentological and contextual evidence in the cases we describe, the current version also reflects upon other possible mechanisms for the accumulation of bones or bodies. The data show that the sedimentary fill associated with the H. naledi remains in the cases we examine could not have passively accumulated slowly and is not indicative of mass movement by slumping or other high-energy flow. To further put these results into context, we added a section to the Discussion that briefly reviews prior work on distinguishing pits in Pleistocene burial contexts, including the substantial number of sites with accepted burial evidence for which no evidence of a pit is present. Extent of articulation and anatomical association We have added significantly greater detail to the descriptions of articulated remains and orientation of remains in order to describe more specifically the configuration of the skeletal material. We also provide 14 figures in main text (13 of them new) to illustrate the configuration of skeletal remains in our data. For the Puzzle Box area, this now includes substantial evidence on the individuation of skeletal fragments, which enables us to illustrate the spatial configuration of remains associated with the DH7 partial skeleton, as well as the spatial position of fragments refitted as part of the DH1, DH2, DH3, and DH4 crania. For Dinaledi Feature 1 and the Hill Antechamber Feature we now provide figures that key skeletal parts as identified, including material that is unexcavated where possible, and a skeletal part representation figure for elements excavated from Dinaledi Feature 1. Archaeothanatology Reviewer 2 suggests that a greater focus on the archaeothanatology literature would be helpful to the analysis, with specific reference to the sequence of joint disarticulation, the collapse of sediment and remains into voids created by decomposition, and associated fragmentation of the remains. In the revised manuscript we have provided additional analysis of the Hill Antechamber Feature with this approach in mind. This includes greater detail and illustration of our current hypothesis for individuation of elements. We now discuss a hypothesis of body disposition, describe the persistent joints and articulation of elements, and examine likely decomposition scenarios associated with these remains. Additionally, we expand our description and illustration of the orientation of remains and degree of anatomical association and articulation within Dinaledi Feature 1. For this feature and for the Hill Antechamber Feature we have revised the text to describe how fracturing and crushing patterns are consistent with downward pressure from overlying sediment and material. In these features, postdepositional fracturing occurred subsequent to the decomposition of soft tissue and partial loss of organic integrity of the bone. We also indicate that the loss by postdepositional processes of most long bone epiphyses, vertebral bodies, and other portions of the skeleton less rich in cortical bone, poses a challenge for testing the anatomical associations of the remaining elements. This is a primary reason why we have taken a conservative approach to identification of elements and possible associations. A further aspect of the site revealed by our analysis is the selective reworking of sediments within the Puzzle Box area subsequent to the primary deposition of some bodies. The skeletal evidence from this area includes body parts with elements in anatomical association or articulation, juxtaposed closely with bone fragments at varied pitch and orientation. This complexity of events evidenced within this area is a challenge for approaches that have been developed primarily based on comparative data from single-burial situations. In these discussions we deepen our use of references as suggested by the referee. Burial positions Reviewer 2 further suggests that illustrations of hypothesized burial positions would be valuable. We recognize that a hypothesized burial position may be an appealing illustration, and that some recent studies have created such illustrations in the context of their scientific articles. However such illustrations generally include a great deal of speculation and artist imagination, and tend to have an emotive character. We have added more discussion to the manuscript of possible primary disposition in the case of the Hill Antechamber Feature as discussed above. We have not created new illustrations of hypothesized burial positions for this revision. Carnivore involvement Referee 1 suggests that the manuscript should provide further consideration of whether carnivore activity may have introduced bones or bodies into the cave system. The reorganized Introduction now includes a review of previous work, and an expanded discussion within the Supplementary Information (“Hypotheses tested in previous work”). This includes a review of literature on the topic of carnivore accumulation and the evidence from the Dinaledi and Lesedi Chamber that rejects this hypothesis. Water transport and mud The eLife referees broadly accepted previous work showing that water inundation or mass flow of water-saturated sediment did not occur within the history of Unit 2 and 3 sediments, including those associated with H. naledi remains. However several outside commentators did refer specifically to water flow or mud flow as a mechanism for slumping of deposits and possible sedimentary covering of the remains. To address these comments we have added a section to the Supplementary Information (“Description of the sedimentary deposits of the Dinaledi Subsystem”) that reviews previous work on the sedimentary units and formation processes documented in this area. We also include a subsection specifically discussing the term “mud” as used in the description of the sedimentology within the system, as this term has clearly been confusing for nonspecialists who have read and commented on the work. We appreciate the referees’ attention to the previous work and its terminology. Redescription of areas of the cave system Reviewer 1 suggests that a detailed reanalysis of all portions of the cave system in and around the Dinaledi Subsystem is warranted to reject the hypothesis that bodies entered the space passively and were scattered from the floor by natural (i.e. noncultural) processes. The referee suggests that National Geographic could help us with these efforts. To address this comment we have made several changes to the manuscript. As noted above, we have added material in Supplementary Information to review the geochronology of the Dinaledi Subsystem and nearby Dragon’s Back Chamber, together with a discussion of the connections between these spaces. Most directly in response to this comment we provide additional documentation of the possibility of movement of bodies or body parts by gravity within the subsystem itself. This includes detailed floor maps based on photogrammetry and LIDAR measurement, where these are physically possible, presented in Figures 2 and 3. In some parts of the subsystem the necessary equipment cannot be used due to the extremely confined spaces, and for these areas our maps are based on traditional survey methods. In addition to plan maps we have included a figure showing the elevation of the subsystem floor in a cross-section that includes key excavation areas, showing their relative elevation. All figures that illustrate excavation areas are now keyed to their location with reference to a subsystem plan. These data have been provided in previous publications but the visualization in the revised manuscript should make the relationship of areas clear for readers. The Introduction now includes text that discusses the configuration of the Hill Antechamber, Dinaledi Chamber, and nearby areas, and also discusses the instances in which gravity-driven movement may be possible, at the same time reviewing that gravity-driven movement from the entry point of the subsystem to most of the localities with hominin skeletal remains is not possible. Within the Results, we have added a section on the relationship of features to their surroundings in order to assist readers in understanding the context of these bone-bearing areas and the evidence this context brings to the hypothesis in question. We have also included within this new section a discussion of the discrete nature of these features, a question that has been raised by outside commentators. Passive sedimentation upon a cave floor or within a natural depression Reviewer 3 suggests that the situation in the Dinaledi Subsystem may be similar to a European cave where a cave bear skeleton might remain articulated on a cave floor (or we can add, within a hollow for hibernation), later to be covered in sediment. The reviewer suggests that articulation is therefore no evidence of burial, and suggests that further documentation of disarticulation processes is essential to demonstrating the processes that buried the remains. We concur that articulation by itself is not sufficient evidence of cultural burial. To address this comment we have included a section in the Results that tests the hypothesis that bodies were exposed upon the cave floor or within a natural depression. To a considerable degree, additional data about disarticulation processes subsequent to deposition are provided in our reanalysis of the Puzzle Box area, including evidence for selective reworking of material after burial. Postdepositional movement and floor drains Reviewer 3 notes that previous work has suggested that subsurface floor drains may have caused some postdepositional movement of skeletal remains. The hypothesis of postdepositional slumping or downslope movement has also been discussed by some external commentators (including Martinón-Torres et al. 2024). We have addressed this question in several places within the revised manuscript. As we now review, previous discussion of floor drains attempted to explain the subvertical orientation of many skeletal elements excavated from the Puzzle Box area. The arrangement of these bones reflects reworking as described in our previous work, and without considering the possibility of reworking by hominins, one mechanism that conceivably might cause reworking was downward movement of sediments into subsurface drains. Further exploration and mapping, combined with additional excavation into the sediments beneath the Puzzle Box area provided more information relevant to this hypothesis. In particular this evidence shows that subsurface drains cannot explain the arrangement of skeletal material observed within the Puzzle Box area. As now discussed in the text, the reworking is selective and initiated from above rather than below. This is best explained by hominin activity subsequent to burial. In a new section of the Results we discuss slumping as a hypothesis for the deposition of the remains. This includes discussion of downslope movement within the Hill Antechamber and the idea that floor drains may have been a mechanism for sediment reworking in and around the Puzzle Box area and Dinaledi Feature 1. As described in this section the evidence does not support these hypotheses. Hypothesis testing and parsimony Referees 1 and 3 and the editorial guidance all suggested that a more appropriate presentation would adopt a null hypothesis and test it. The specific suggestion that the null hypothesis should be a natural sedimentary process of deposition was provided not only by these reviewers but also by some outside commentators. To address this comment, we have edited the manuscript in two ways. The first is the addition of a section to the Discussion that specifically discusses hypothesis testing and parsimony as related to Pleistocene evidence of cultural burial. This includes a brief synopsis of recent disciplinary conversations and citation of work by other groups of authors, none of whom adopted this “null hypothesis” approach in their published work. As we now describe in the manuscript, previous work on the Dinaledi evidence never assumed any role for H. naledi in the burial of remains. Reading the reviewer reports caused us to realize that this previous work had followed exactly the “null hypothesis” approach that some suggested we follow. By following this null hypothesis approach, we neglected a valuable avenue of investigation. In retrospect, we see how this approach impeded us from understanding the pattern of evidence within the Puzzle Box area. Thus in the revised manuscript we have mentioned this history within the Discussion and also presented more of the background to our previous work in the Introduction. Hopefully by including this discussion of these issues, the manuscript will broaden conversation about the relation of parsimony to these issues. Language and presentation style Reviewer 4 criticizes our presentation, suggesting that the text “gives the impression that a hypothesis was formulated before data were collected.” Other outside commentators have mentioned this notion also, including Martinón-Torres et al. (2024) who suggest that the study began from a preferred hypothesis and gathered data to support it. The accurate communication of results and hypotheses in a scientific article is a broader issue than this one study. Preferences about presentation style vary across fields of study as well as across languages. We do not regret using plain language where possible. In any study that combines data and methods from different scientific disciplines, the use of plain language is particularly important to avoid misunderstandings where terms may mean different things in different fields. The essential question raised by these comments is whether it is appropriate to present the results of a study in terms of the hypothesis that is best supported. As noted above, we read carefully many recent studies of Pleistocene burial evidence. We note that in each of these studies that concluded that burial is the best hypothesis, the authors framed their results in the same way as our previous manuscript: an introduction that briefly reviews background evidence for treatment of the dead, a presentation of results focused on how each analysis supports the hypothesis of burial for the case, and then in some (but not all) cases discussion of why some alternative hypotheses could be rejected. We do not infer from this that these other studies started from a presupposition and collected data only to confirm it. Rather, this is a simple matter of presentation style. The alternative to this approach is to present an exhaustive list of possible hypotheses and to describe how the data relate to each of them, at the end selecting the best. This is the approach that we have followed in the revised manuscript, as described above under the direction of the reviewer and editorial guidance. This approach has the advantage of bringing together evidence in different combinations to show how each data point rejects some hypotheses while supporting others. It has the disadvantage of length and repetition. Possible artifact We have chosen to keep the description of the possible artifact associated with the Hill Antechamber Feature in the Supplementary Information. We do this while acknowledging that this is against the opinion of reviewer 4, who felt the description should be removed unless the object in question is fully excavated and physically analyzed. The previous version of the manuscript did not rely upon the stone as positive evidence of grave goods or symbolic content, and it noted that the data do not test whether the possible artifact was placed or was intentionally modified. However this did not satisfy reviewer 4, and some outside commentators likewise asserted that the object must be a “geofact” and that it should be removed. We have three arguments against this line of thinking. First, we do not omit data from our reporting. Whether Homo naledi shaped the rock or not, used it as a tool or not, whether the rock was placed with the body or not, it is unquestionably there. Omitting this one object from the report would be simply dishonest. Second, the data on this rock are at 16 micron resolution. While physical inspection of its surface may eventually reveal trace evidence and will enable better characterization of the raw material, no mode of surface scanning will produce better evidence about the object’s shape. Third, the position of this possible artifact within the feature provides significant information about the deposition of the skeletal material and associated sediments. The pitch, orientation, and position of the stone is not consistent with slow deposition but are consistent with the hypothesis that the surrounding sediment was rapidly emplaced at the same time as the articulated elements less than 2 cm away. In the current version, we have redoubled our efforts to provide information about the position and shape of this stone while not presupposing the intentionality of its shape or placement. We add here that the attitude expressed by referee 4 and other commentators, if followed at other sites, would certainly lead to the loss or underreporting of evidence, which we are trying to avoid. Consistency versus variability of behavior As described in the revised manuscript, different features within the Dinaledi Subsystem exhibit some shared characteristics. At the same time, they vary in positioning, representation of individuals and extent of commingling. Other localities within the subsystem and broader cave system present different evidence. Some commentators have questioned whether the patterning is consistent with a single common explanation, or whether multiple explanations are necessary. To address this line of questioning, we have added several elements to the manuscript. We created a new section on secondary cultural burial, discussing whether any of the situations may reflect this practice. In the Discussion, we briefly review the ways in which the different features support the involvement of H. naledi without interpreting anything about the intentionality or meaning of the behavior. We further added a section to the Discussion to consider whether variation among the features reflects variation in mortuary practices by H. naledi. One aspect of this section briefly cites variation in the location and treatment of skeletal remains at other sites with evidence of burial. Grave goods Some commentators have argued that grave goods are a necessary criterion for recognizing evidence of ancient burial. We added a section to the Discussion to review evidence of grave goods at other Pleistocene sites where burial is accepted.",2024-08-12T09:58:10,johnhawks,John Hawks,10.1101/2023.06.01.543127,Evidence for deliberate burial of the dead by Homo naledi,"Lee R Berger, Tebogo Makhubela, Keneiloe Molopyane, Ashley Krüger, Patrick Randolph-Quinney, Marina Elliott, Becca Peixotto, Agustín Fuentes, Paul Tafforeau, Vincent Beyrand, Kathleen Dollman, Zubair Jinnah, Angharad Brewer Gillham, Kenneth Broad, Juliet Brophy, Gideon Chinamatira, Paul H.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.01.543127v2#comment-6525793461,biorxivstage,3,"The authors have prepared a summary of revisions to this manuscript, which is available in the Supplementary Information section of the preprint. I have included the text of that summary across the following two comments in two parts (the whole is larger than the maximum comment length). Summary of revisions to Evidence for deliberate burial of the dead by Homo naledi We extend our sincere thanks to the editor, referees for eLife, and other commentators who have written evaluations of this manuscript, either in whole or in part. Sources of these comments were highly varied, including within the bioRxiv preprint server, social media (including many comments received on X/Twitter and some YouTube presentations and interviews), comments made by colleagues to journalists, and also some reviews of the work published in other academic journals. Some of these are formal and referenced with citations. Others were informal but nonetheless expressed perspectives that helped enable us to revise the manuscript with the inclusion of broader perspectives than the formal review process. It is beyond the scope of this summary to list every one of these, which have often been brought to the attention of different coauthors, but we begin by acknowledging the very wide array of peer and public commentary that have contributed to this work. The reaction speaks to a broad interest in open discussion and review of preprints. As we compiled this summary of changes to the manuscript, we recognized that many colleagues made comments about the process of preprint dissemination and evaluation rather than the data or analyses in the manuscript. Addressing such comments is outside the scope of this revised manuscript, but we do feel that a broader discussion of these comments would be valuable in another venue. Many commentators have expressed confusion about the eLife system of evaluation of preprints, which differs from the editorial acceptance or rejection practiced in most academic journals. As authors in many different nations, in varied fields, and in varied career stages, we ourselves are still working to understand how the academic publication landscape is changing, and how best to prepare work for new models of evaluation and dissemination. The manuscript and coauthor list reflect an interdisciplinary collaboration. Analyses presented in the manuscript come from a wide range of scientific disciplines. These range from skeletal inventory, morphology, and description, spatial taphonomy, analysis of bone fracture patterns and bone surface modifications, sedimentology, geochemistry, and traditional survey and mapping. The manuscript additionally draws upon a large number of previous studies of the Rising Star cave system and the Dinaledi Subsystem, which have shaped our current work. No analysis within any one area of research stands alone within this body of work: all are interpreted in conjunction with the outcomes of other analyses and data from other areas of research. Any single analysis in isolation might be consistent with many different hypotheses for the formation of sediments and disposition of the skeletal remains. But testing a hypothesis requires considering all data in combination and not leaving out data that do not fit the hypothesis. We highlight this general principle at the outset because a number of the comments from referees and outside specialists have presented alternative hypotheses that may arguably be consistent with one kind of analysis that we have presented, while seeming to overlook other analyses, data, or previous work that exclude these alternatives. In our revision, we have expanded all sections describing results to consider not only the results of each analysis, but how the combination of data from different kinds of analysis relate to hypotheses for the deposition and subsequent history of the Homo naledi remains. We address some specific examples and how we have responded to these in our summary of changes below. General organization The referee and editor comments are mostly general and not line-by-line questions, and we have compiled them and treated them as a group in this summary of changes, except where specifically noted. The editorial comments on the previous version included the suggestion that the manuscript should be reorganized to test “natural” (i.e. noncultural) hypotheses for the situations that we examine. The editorial comment suggested this as a “null hypothesis” testing approach. Some outside comments also viewed noncultural deposition as a null hypothesis to be rejected. We do not concur that noncultural processes should be construed as a null hypothesis, as we discuss further below. However, because of the clear editorial opinion we elected to revise the manuscript to make more explicit how the data and analyses test noncultural depositional hypotheses first, followed by testing of cultural hypotheses. This reorganization means that the revised manuscript now examines each hypothesis separately in turn. Taking this approach resulted in a substantial reorganization of the “Results” section of the manuscript. The “Results” section now begins with summaries of analyses and data conducted on material from each excavation area. After the presentation of data and analyses from each area, we then present a separate section for each of several hypotheses for the disposition and sedimentary context of the remains. These hypotheses include deposition of bodies upon a talus (as hypothesized in some previous work), slow sedimentary burial on a cave floor or within a natural depression, rapid burial by gravity-driven slumping, and burial of naturally mummified remains. We then include sections to test the hypothesis of primary cultural burial and secondary cultural burial. This approach adds substantial length to the Results. While some elements may be repeated across sections, we do consider the new version to be easier to take piece by piece for a reader trying to understand how each hypothesis relates to the evidence. The Results section includes analyses on several different excavation areas within the Dinaledi Subsystem. Each of these presents somewhat different patterns of data. We conceived of this manuscript combining these distinct areas because each of them provides information about the formation history of the Homo naledi-associated sediments and the deposition of the Homo naledi remains. Together they speak more strongly than separately. In the previous version of the manuscript, two areas of excavation were considered in detail (Dinaledi Feature 1 and the Hill Antechamber Feature), with a third area (the Puzzle Box area) included only in the Discussion and with reference to prior work. We now describe the new work undertaken after the 2013-2014 excavations in more detail. This includes an overview of areas in the Hill Antechamber and Dinaledi Chamber that have not yielded substantial H. naledi remains and that thereby help contextualize the spatial concentration of H. naledi skeletal material. The most substantial change in the data presented is a much expanded reanalysis of the Puzzle Box area. This reanalysis provides greater clarity on how previously published descriptions relate to the new evidence. The reanalysis also provides the data to integrate the detailed information on bone identification fragmentation, and spatial taphonomy from this area with the new excavation results from the other areas. In addition to Results, the reorganization also affected the manuscript’s Introduction section. Where the previous version led directly from a brief review of Pleistocene burial into the description of the results, this revised manuscript now includes a review of previous studies of the Rising Star cave system. This review directly addresses referee comments that express some hesitation to accept previous results concerning the structure and formation of sediments, the accessibility of the Dinaledi Subsystem, the geochronological setting of the H. naledi remains, and the relation of the Dinaledi Subsystem to nearby cave areas. Some parts of this overview are further expanded in the Supplementary Information to enable readers to dive more deeply into the previous literature on the site formation and geological configuration of the Rising Star cave system without needing to digest the entirety of the cited sources. The Discussion section of the revised manuscript is differentiated from Results and focuses on several areas where the evidence presented in this study may benefit from greater context. One new section addresses hypothesis testing and parsimony for Pleistocene burial evidence, which we address at greater length in this summary below. The majority of the Discussion concerns the criteria for recognizing evidence for burial as applied in other studies. In this research we employ a minimal definition but other researchers have applied varied criteria. We consider whether these other criteria have relevance in light of our observations and whether they are essential to the recognition of burial evidence more broadly. Vocabulary We introduce the term “cultural burial” in this revised manuscript to refer to the burial of dead bodies as a mortuary practice. “Burial” as an unmodified term may refer to the passive covering of remains by sedimentary processes. Use of the term “intentional burial” would raise the question of interpreting intent, which we do not presume based on the evidence presented in this research. The relevant question in this case is whether the process of burial reflects repeated behavior by a group. As we received input from various colleagues it became clear that burial itself is a highly loaded term. In particular there is a common assumption within the literature and among professionals that burial must by definition be symbolic. We do not take any position on that question in this manuscript, and it is our hope that the term “cultural burial” may focus the conversation around the extent that the behavioral evidence is repeated and patterned. Sedimentology and geochemistry of Dinaledi Feature 1 Reviewer 4 provided detailed comments on the sedimentological and geochemical context that we report in the manuscript. One outside review (Foecke et al. 2024) included some of the points raised by reviewer 4, and additionally addressed the reporting of geochemical and sedimentological data in previous work that we cite. To address these comments we have revised the sedimentary context and micromorphology of sediments associated with Dinaledi Feature 1. In the new text we demonstrate the lack of microstratigraphy (supported by grain size analysis) in the unlithified mud clast breccia (UMCB), while such a microstratigraphy is observed in the laminated orange-red mudstones (LORM) that contribute clasts to the UMCB. Thus, we emphasize the presence and importance of a laterally continuous layer of LORM nature occurring at a level that appears to be the maximum depth of fossil occurrence. This layer is severely broken under extensive accumulation of fossils such as Feature 1 and only evidenced by abundant LORM clasts within and around the fossils. We have completely reworked the geochemical context associated with Feature 1 following the comments of reviewer 4. We described the variations and trends observed in the major oxides separate from trace and rare-earth elements. We used Harker variations plots to assess relationships between these element groups with CaO and Zn, followed by principal component analysis of all elements analyzed. The new geochemical analysis clearly shows that Feature 1 is associated with localized trace element signatures that exist in the sediments only in association with the fossil bones, which suggests lack of postdepositional mobilization of the fossils and sediments. We additionally have included a fuller description of XRF methods. To clarify the relation of all results to the features described in this study, we removed the geochemical and sedimentological samples from other sites within the Dinaledi Subsystem. These localities within the fissure network represent only surface collection of sediment, as no excavation results are available from those sites to allow for comparison in the context of assessing evidence of burial. These were initially included for comparison, but have now been removed to avoid confusion. Micromorphology of sediments Some referees (1, 3, and 4) and other commentators (including Martinón-Torres et al. 2024) have suggested that the previous manuscript was deficient due to an insufficient inclusion of micromorphological analysis of sediments. Because these commentators have emphasized this kind of evidence as particularly important, we review here what we have included and how our revision has addressed this comment. Previous work in the Dinaledi Chamber (Dirks et al., 2015; 2017) included thin section illustrations and analysis of sediment facies, including sediments in direct association with H. naledi remains within the Puzzle Box area. The previous work by Wiersma and coworkers (2020) used micromorphological analysis as one of several approaches to test the formation history of Unit 3 sediments in the Dinaledi Subsystem, leading to the interpretation of autobrecciation of earlier Unit 1 sediment. In the previous version of this manuscript we provided citations to this earlier work. The previous manuscript also provided new thin section illustrations of Unit 3 sediment near Dinaledi Feature 1 to place the disrupted layer of orange sediment (now designated the laminated orange silty mudstone unit) into context. In the new revised manuscript we have added to this information in three ways. First, as noted above in response to reviewer 4, we have revised and added to our discussion of micromorphology within and adjacent to the Dinaledi Feature 1. Second, we have included more discussion in the Supplementary Information of previous descriptions of sediment facies and associated thin section analysis, with illustrations from prior work (CC-BY licensed) brought into this paper as supplementary figures, so that readers can examine these without following the citations. Third, we have included Figure 10 in the manuscript which includes six panels with microtomographic sections from the Hill Antechamber Feature. This figure illustrates the consistency of sub-unit 3b sediment in direct contact with H. naledi skeletal material, including anatomically associated skeletal elements, with previous analyses that demonstrate the angular outlines and chaotic orientations of LORM clasts. It also shows density contrasts of sediment in immediate contact with some skeletal elements, the loose texture of this sediment with air-filled voids, and apparent invertebrate burrowing activity. To our knowledge this is the first application of microtomography to sediment structure in association with a Pleistocene burial feature. To forestall possible comments that the revised manuscript does not sufficiently employ micromorphological observations, or that any one particular approach to micromorphology is the standard, we present here some context from related studies of evidence from other research groups working at varied sites in Africa, Europe, and Asia. Hodgkins et al. (2021) noted: “Only a handful of micromorphological studies have been conducted on human burials and even fewer have been conducted on suspected burials from Paleolithic or hunter-gatherer contexts.” In that study, one supplementary figure with four photomicrographs of thin sections of sediments was presented. Interpretation of the evidence for a burial pit by Hodgkins et al. (2021) noted the more open microstructure of sediment but otherwise did not rely upon the thin section data in characterizing the sediments associated with grave fill. Martinón-Torres et al. (2021) included one Extended Data figure illustrating thin sections of sediments and bone, with two panels showing sediments (the remainder showing bone histology). The micromorphological analysis presented in the supplementary information of that paper was restricted to description of two microfacies associated with the proposed “pit” in that study. That study did carry out microCT scanning of the partially-prepared skeletal remains but did not report any sediment analysis from the microtomographic results. Maloney et al. (2022) reported no micromorphological or thin section analysis. Pomeroy et al. (2020a) included one illustration of a thin section; this study may be regarded as a preliminary account rather than a full description of the work undertaken. Goldberg et al. (2017) analyzed the geoarchaeology of the Roc de Marsal deposits in which possible burial-associated sediments had been fully excavated in the 1960s, providing new morphological assessments of sediment facies; the supplementary information to this work included five scans (not microscans) of sediment thin sections and no microphotographs. Fewlass et al. (2023) presented no thin section or micromorphological illustrations or methods. In summary of this research, we note that in one case micromorphological study provided observations that contributed to the evidence for a pit, in other cases micromorphological data did not test this hypothesis, and many researchers do not apply micromorphological techniques in their particular contexts. Sediment micromorphology is a growing area of research and may have much to provide to the understanding of ancient burial evidence as its standards continue to develop (Pomeroy et al. 2020b). In particular microtomographic analysis of sediments, as we have initiated in this study, may open new horizons that are not possible with more destructive thin-section preparation. In this manuscript, the thin section data reveals valuable evidence about the disruption of sediment structure by features within the Dinaledi Chamber, and microtomographic analysis further documents that the Hill Antechamber Feature reflects similar processes, in addition to possible post-burial diagenesis and invertebrate activity. Following up in detail on these processes will require further analysis outside the scope of this manuscript. Access into the Dinaledi Subsystem Reviewer 1 emphasizes the difficulty of access into the Dinaledi Subsystem as a reason why the burial hypothesis is not parsimonious. Similar comments have been made by several outside commentators who question whether past accessibility into the Dinaledi Subsystem may at one time have been substantially different from the situation documented in previous work. Several pieces of evidence are relevant to these questions and we have included some discussion of them in the Introduction, and additionally include a section in the Supplementary Information (“Entrances to the cave system”) to provide additional context for these questions. Homo naledi remains are found not only within the Dinaledi Subsystem but also in other parts of the cave system including the Lesedi Chamber, which is similarly difficult for non-expert cavers to access. The body plan, mass, and specific morphology of H. naledi suggest that this species would be vastly more suited to moving and climbing within narrow underground passages than living people. On this basis it is not unparsimonious to suggest that the evidence resulted from H. naledi activity within these spaces. We note that the accessibility of the subsystem is not strictly relevant to the hypothesis of cultural burial, although the location of the remains does inform the overall context which may reflect a selection of a location perceived as special in some way. Stuffing bodies down the entry to the subsystem Reviewer 3 suggests that one explanation for the emplacement of articulated remains at the top of the sloping floor of the Hill Antechamber is that bodies were “stuffed” into the chute that comprises the entry point of the subsystem and passively buried by additional accumulation of remains. This was one hypothesis presented in earlier work (Dirks et al. 2015) and considered there as a minimal explanation because it did not entail the entry of H. naledi individuals into the subsystem. The further exploration (Elliott et al. 2021) and ongoing survey work, as well as this manuscript, all have resulted in data that rejects this hypothesis. The revised manuscript includes a section in the results “Deposition upon a talus with passive burial” that examines this hypothesis in light of the data.",2024-08-12T09:57:17,johnhawks,John Hawks,10.1101/2023.06.01.543127,Evidence for deliberate burial of the dead by Homo naledi,"Lee R Berger, Tebogo Makhubela, Keneiloe Molopyane, Ashley Krüger, Patrick Randolph-Quinney, Marina Elliott, Becca Peixotto, Agustín Fuentes, Paul Tafforeau, Vincent Beyrand, Kathleen Dollman, Zubair Jinnah, Angharad Brewer Gillham, Kenneth Broad, Juliet Brophy, Gideon Chinamatira, Paul H.

This includes the structural characterization of the mechanism of inhibition at both active-sites, which importantly revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 NiRAN domain contains a guanine-specific pocket. This has now been confirmed in other studies 2,3, and represents a promising avenue for future drug development studies. Following several contradictory reports on the ability of the NiRAN to NMPylate different cofactor proteins (4–6), we have now carried out additional analysis on the protein-priming activity and NMPylation specificity. This has revealed that our nsp8 product is labeled at the primary amine of a non-native glycine residue, present at the N-terminus of the expression construct (following cleavage with TEV protease), and negating the biological relevance of these findings. Surprisingly, removal of this single residue, exposing the true N-terminal alanine, eliminates all labeling and protein-primed activity, stressing the importance for using proteins with native N- and C- termini. Of note, the current publication does not reflect these new findings, but instead has been left as the initially submitted manuscript. Later studies have now revealed nsp9 to be the primary target for both NMPylation5,7, and RNAylation8 – a conclusion that we fully agree with. With the exception of our finding that nsp8 can be used to prime-synthesis, albeit by a non-native residue, there was no other evidence for protein-priming until recently. In October, 2023, Schmidt et al., published the finding that nsp9 is covalently linked to the 5' end of positive- and negative-sense RNA produced during SARS-CoV-2 infection9. This linkage was found to be regulated by its interaction with the host protein, staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1 (SND1),  which was found to specifically recognize the 5’ end of negative-sense RNA and be important for viral RNA synthesis. Although it is highly frustrating to have spent several years focused on the wrong protein, this finding supports the notion that protein-priming is occurring in CoVs, and opens up a plethora of options for further mechanistic and structural studies. Of note, Schmidt et al. also showed that nsp9-linkage on the (-)sense strand mapped roughly between the genome and poly(A) tail. Intriguingly, we also found a similar specificity for this region. Here we show that the SARS-CoV mRTC (nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) can initiate synthesis through a de novo, NiRAN independent pathway, through the synthesis of a pppGpU primer. This dinucleotide is complementary to the last two nucleotides of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, located precisely at the genome-poly(A) junction. De novo initiation was found to directly compete with the (artificial) nsp8-poly(U) protein-primed synthesis. This shows that the poly(A) tail and 3’ genomic RNA sequence elements guide the positioning of the mRTC to the true 3’-end of the genome. The specific details behind initiation of RNA synthesis, including the role of SND1 and potential coordination between protein-priming and/or de novo induction remains to be studied. Synthesis initiation, and the precise role of the NiRAN therefore appears to be a complicated story, which remains to be fully elucidated.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262v1#comment-6520634471,biorxivstage,1,"Summary : Zhan et al argue that nearly identical (>99.9% in the S gene or across a whole genome) sequences sampled within a single species indicate transmission within a single species subsequent to a period of host adaptation, assuming the necessity of adaptive mutations in any new host. They repeatedly claim that similar identical genomes were never sampled in different species in SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004. This is incorrect. In fact, the data cited in this paper includes at least four examples of 100% sequence identity in samples from different species. Thus, the statement ""In the SARS-CoV outbreaks, >99.9% genome or S identity was only observed among isolates collected within a narrow window of time from within the same species"" was incorrect. Example 1 : Figure 5 and the manuscript discuss samples SZ3 and SZ16 collected from palm civets in 2004 in Dongmen market in Shenzhen. However, sample SZ13, reported from the same study (Guan et al, Science 2003, accession AY304487) is not mentioned. It was collected from a raccoon dog and it is 100% identical to SZ16 over 8581 bases in a partial genome sequence inclusive of S. Furthermore, Guan et al also reported neutralization of SZ16 infection by sera from masked palm civets (3 of 6 samples), raccoon dog (1 of 1), Chinese ferret badger (1 of 2), and human (12/55; 8/20 for humans in wild animal trade). This indicates widespread infection of diverse species by SARS with >99.9% identical genomes without requiring further host adaptation. It's possible this error is inherited from Song et al (PNAS 2005), which twice states that SZ13 is a sample from a civet. This error is perplexing since the primary source for this data is clear on what animals were sampled and sequence identity. What's less well known is that Dongmen market continued to be sampled after May (Yaqing et al, Disease Surveillance 2004). Civets, raccoon dogs, and badgers were still available for sampling and still positive by PCR for SARS in October, November, and December 2003. It wasn't until spillover from civets to humans was definitively shown for the Guangzhou outbreak (Wang et al, Emerg Infect Dis 2005) that Guangdong province acted to close wildlife markets and end the civet trade. Dr. Garry notes similar findings at Xinyuan market in Guangzhou in January 2024. Example 2 and 3 : Zhan et al write, ""The human and civet isolates of the 2003/2004 outbreak, which were collected most closely in time and at the site of cross-species transmission, shared only up to 99.79% S identity.” This is incorrect. Wang et al (Emergency Infect Dis 2005) write, ""The 286-bp S gene sequences from isolates from the waitress and the physician were identical to 4 of 5 S gene sequences from palm civets from the restaurant.” Example 4 : The 99.79% identical sequence described by Wang et al (Emergency Infect Dis 2005) is instead from a different patient without a known link to the civet or other animal trade — a patient identified about one month before the first patient in the restaurant cluster. However, “An isogenic strain with the same SNV pattern, B012G, was detected in a palm civet from the Xinyuan animal market” (Kan et al J Virol 2005). Conclusion : Repeated claims of no examples of 99.9% identical viruses in different species during SARS outbreaks were provably incorrect when this manuscript was preprinted. Furthermore, the manuscript appeals to near-identity of sequences obtained within Huanan market. Subsequently, it has been shown that both lineage A and lineage B were found in environmental sampling of Huanan market.

After its submission, the manuscript, which details the development and performance of probes with nanomolar affinities to the gp120 receptor for detecting SIV uptake in vivo, was under editorial consideration until July 24th, 2024. It was subsequently rejected before being sent to external reviewers. The grounds for rejection were that the technical advances presented, specifically the demonstration of negative results, would not have a sufficiently significant and immediate impact on a broader readership. An appeal was submitted on July 25th, 2024, emphasizing the high expected impact of our findings, particularly in light of their potential to challenge the validity of a decade's worth of studies and highlighting the ongoing reproducibility crisis in scientific research that has been increasingly discussed in recent years. It was argued that the publication of such studies is crucial for fostering scientific integrity and progress. If scientific journals do not embrace and publish studies that challenge established findings from prestigious journals, we (as entire scientific community) risk stagnating in our efforts to address the reproducibility crisis. Our study, which demanded significant manpower and resources, exemplifies this challenge. The probability that research teams will mobilize substantial resources to address reproducibility issues (like we did in our study) is minimal, if not nonexistent, unless the editorial community values and supports these contributions. Following the appeal, the manuscript has returned to ""under editorial consideration"" status. A further editorial decision is now awaited, with a commitment to the dissemination of the research findings remaining strong. The continued interest and support from the community is appreciated, and further updates will be provided as they become available",2024-07-28T16:59:33,michele_di_mascio,Michele Di Mascio,10.1101/2024.07.05.601545,Whole-body PET imaging of SIV using anti-Env probes fails to reveal regions of specific uptake in rhesus macaques,"Sharat Srinivasula, Insook Kim, Hyukjin Jang, Paula Degrange, Heather Brown, Viviana Dalton, Yunden Badralmaa, Ven Natarajan, Brad Long, Jorge A.

The authors suggest that mutation to an isoleucine residue at position nsp16 I219 will ""occur without having a significant impact on fitness linked to a disruptive function at a protein level."" The residue I219 is well resolved in crystal structures (e.g. PDB 6WVN) and makes hydrophobic contacts with other hydrophobic sidechains, suggesting that this is unlikely to be the case. This is testable by mutational fitness analysis -- https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2-mut-fitness/nsp16.html -- out of possible non-synonymous mutations that are sufficiently sampled during the pandemic, I219 tolerates substitution to leucine or valine, methionine is slightly disfavored, and mutation to any of arginine, lysine, or threonine is very rare. This suggests a significant fitness impact of substitutions at this position.",2024-07-23T16:05:44,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,10.1101/2024.07.18.604213,Early evolution of the BA.2.86 variant sheds light on the origins of highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 lineages,"Marina Escalera-Zamudio, Cedric C S Tan, Lucy van Dorp, François Balloux",2024-07-19
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.18.604213v1#comment-6510704486,biorxivstage,1,"This preprint claims that the BA.2.86 lineage, which first appeared in the sequencing record in late July 2023, evolved gradually, while cryptically circulating over the course of about 17 months, beginning in early 2022. I do not find any of the evidence presented here convincing. Three clusters of sequences, named C1, C2, and C3, are cited as evidence of cryptic BA.2.86 circulation prior to its emergence on the world stage. Each cluster has a far simpler, more parsimonious explanation than the hypothesis presented by the authors. I have documented and analyzed cluster C1 as they have been uploaded, beginning in October 2023, and it appears to be a classic case of a chronic infection in an immunocompromised individual who may have transmitted to one other person. Three of the four C1 sequences have matching metadata—same location, age, and sex—while the fourth has the same location and age but a different sex. Furthermore, there are two additional, closely related sequences collected in 2024 (EPI_ISL_18969735 and EPI_ISL_19259365) whose metadata also match the other three. It seems very unlikely the C1 sequences have any relation to BA.2.86. I count approximately 17 spike substitutions and one large deletion (∆138-144) that are in two or more of these four sequences but not in BA.2.86, including P9L, H69D, K77E, T95I, ∆136-144, R158K, Q183E, G213E, D215G, R346T, L452R, F486L, V615A, V642G, H681Y, L841R, D936Y, and D1146N. None of the four C1 sequences have the most distinctive spike mutations of BA.2.86, such as ins16MPLF, the triple-nucleotide F157S-R158G, A264D, I332V, K356T, L452W, or ∆V483. All C1 sequences have ORF1a:L3201F, which is found in BA.2 but not BA.2.86, and none of the C1 sequences possess any of the seven synonymous mutations found in the BA.2.86 branch (C8293T, T13339C, T15756A, A18492G, C21622T, C25207T, C26681T). Of the more than 30 spike mutations (relative to baseline BA.2) in BA.2.86, I only see four that are shared between BA.2.86 and the C1 sequences: R403K, A484K, R493Q (reversion), and P621S. All of these are extremely convergent in highly mutated, chronic-infection sequences. I maintain a list of such sequences, and the R493Q reversion is the single most common private mutation, occurring 304 times independently, while R403K appears 103 times, and P621S 60 times. A484K, despite being a two-nucleotide mutation, has independently evolved at least 15 times among the sequences I've recorded. (G446S—very common both in chronic-infection sequences and circulating lineages—is in 2/6 sequences from this cluster). Furthermore, the most recently uploaded sequence from this cluster—collected on May 22, 2024, but not listed in the C1 cluster in this paper—contains 16 new spike mutations (at least two of which I suspect can be attributed to sotrovimab treatment). Four of the 16 new spike mutations are also in BA.2.86 (I332V, K356T, L486P, and S939F), a textbook example of how, through convergent intrahost evolution, chronic-infection sequences can come to acquire mutations found in other chronic infections and in unrelated circulating lineages. I do not see any resemblance between BA.2.86 and the C1 cluster in the non-spike part of the genome, apart from M:A104V, which is commonly found in chronic-infection sequences (32 independent acquisitions by my count), and is also found in the Pango-designated GS.4/5 lineage (XBB.2.3.11.4/5). It seems to me that this is a case of a chronically infected, immunocompromised individual who developed a few mutations also found in BA.2.86—mutations which are convergent in such chronic infections—and who may have transmitted to one other person (assuming there was not a mistake in the sex assignment of EPI_ISL_18415854, in which case these sequences almost certainly all came from the same patient). The phylogenetic relationship between these sequences, as determined by USHER (Ultrafast Sample placement on Existing tRee, created at University of California Santa Cruz and maintained by Angie Hinrichs), can be seen at the following link: https://nextstrain.org/fetch/raw.githubusercontent.com/ryhisner/posited_BA.2.86_intermediates/main/BA.2.86_C1_posited_intermediates_Mexico_6_seq.json?c=gt-S_841&gmax=25384&gmin=21563&label=id:node_3061533 The C2 cluster (12 sequences of XBB.1.5.90, 11 from Japan, one from Finland) does not seem to resemble BA.2.86 at all. It is part of a large branch of XBB.1.5.90 (>400 sequences) with S:P621S, also found in BA.2.86, and the only other private mutation I see that it shares with BA.2.86 (but not other hundreds of other XBB.1.5.90 sequences) is C26681T, which is a highly homoplasic synonymous mutation in the coding region of M. Perhaps I am overlooking something, but the C2 cluster looks like a relatively humdrum branch of XBB.1.5.90 to me. The Usher tree for these 12 sequences from C2 can be viewed here: https://nextstrain.org/fetch/raw.githubusercontent.com/ryhisner/posited_BA.2.86_intermediates/main/BA.2.86_C2_posited_intermediates_JPN_FIN_12_seq.json?c=userOrOld&label=id:node_4041697 The C3 cluster consisting of 10 sequences from Sarawak, Malaysia, were all uploaded on the same day (2024-1-25), bear the same collection date (2022-3-11), and have spikes identical to JN.1—including S:L455S—from S:356 to S:681, while the rest of spike is identical to baseline BA.2. The remainder of the genome in these sequences is extremely odd. Two sequences contain the XBB mutation ORF1b:S959P. Seven have the universal BA.2.86 mutation ORF1a:N2526S, while three lack it. One has the BA.2.86.1 mutation ORF1a:K1973R. Seven of the ten have ORF1a:L3201F, which is absent from all BA.2.86. No dropout is indicated in any of the sequences. The same Malaysian lab uploaded 321 other sequences (EPI_ISL_18821317-18821647), all from Sarawak, Malaysia, on the same day they uploaded the 10 C3 sequences. The collection dates of these sequences range from 2022-2-27 to 2024-1-9 and include 153 JN.1* sequences and 12 XBB* sequences. As Zach Hensel has noted, six of the ten C3 sequences have G19677T (ORF1b:2070H), which is the defining mutation of BA.2.40, a variant that made up about 60% of all sequences in Sarawak, Malaysia, in mid-March 2022. (Source: https://cov-spectrum.org/explore/Malaysia/AllSamples/from%3D2022-01-15%26to%3D2022-04-28/variants?nextcladeQcSnpClustersScoreTo=55&variantQuery=Nextcladepangolineage%3ABA.2.40*&) Sixty-three sequences in this upload are categorized by Nextclade as being BA.2.40 and have 0-3 mutations relative to baseline BA.2.40. Most suspicious of all, 29 of the 153 JN.1* sequences in this same upload also have G19677T. From July 1, 2023 to the present, just 77 sequences categorized by CovSpectrum as BA.2.86*  (from 13 different Pango-designated lineages) have had G19677T, with 30 of those coming from Malaysia. (Source: https://cov-spectrum.org/explore/World/AllSamples/from%3D2023-07-01%26to%3D2024-07-14/variants?variantQuery=Nextcladepangolineage%3ABA.2.86*+%26+G19677T&) It seems clear that the 10 C2 sequences were BA.2 sequences contaminated by JN.1 sequences from the same upload. The authors list 129 sequences they claim shorten the branch leading to BA.2.86, of which I was able to find 128 on GISAID. Ten of these sequences are from the C3 Malaysian cluster described above, along with one additional sequence from the same upload. Apart from these C3 sequences, there are only six sequences with collection dates preceding the first BA.2.86 sequences. All others were collected more than seven weeks after the first BA.2.86 sequences. Six sequences were collected between 7-14 weeks after the first BA.2.86, while the remaining 105 sequences were collected more than 15 weeks afterward. It would be surprising if one could not find hundreds of such ""hybrid"" sequences due purely to contamination. Such sequences have frequently appeared in the sequencing record throughout the pandemic. A few sequences may result from coinfection, but the quality of these sequences, described below, along with the fact that a large proportion of them come from a small number of labs with records of quality-control issues, support the hypothesis that these sequences result from contamination or other lab errors. All of the sequences in this list are low quality. They feature a mixture of extensive dropout (particularly in spike), frameshifts, large numbers of mixed nucleotides, clearly artifactual reversions, and mutations from multiple lineages (primarily BA.2.86 and XBB) with no distinct breakpoints. Many of these sequences come from labs known to have frequent quality-control issues. For example, there are 52 sequences from the United States, but none are from the CDC, whose sequences are virtually always first-rate. Instead, they come from smaller local and state labs, whose sequencing quality is often inconsistent. The 28 sequences from Texas, for example, come from city hospitals. The average Nextclade qc score of these sequences is 2901 (median 2882). Anything over 100 is designated ""bad"" by Nextclade. The average number of ambiguous nucleotides per sequences is 17 (median 17), and they average 690 nucleotides of dropout.

Some sequences on the list are somewhat less bad than these, but none are high-quality. (EPI_ISL_18496352, EPI_ISL_18674020, EPI_ISL_18677248, EPI_ISL_18721993, EPI_ISL_18722001, EPI_ISL_18722007, EPI_ISL_18722009, EPI_ISL_18755145, EPI_ISL_18792827, EPI_ISL_18792828, EPI_ISL_18792829, EPI_ISL_18792831, EPI_ISL_18820147, EPI_ISL_18820149, EPI_ISL_18820150, EPI_ISL_18820154, EPI_ISL_18820157) Finally, I also examined the list of 100 sequences from Supplementary Data 1, Table 5, containing genomes posited by the authors to be recombinants related to ancestors of BA.2.86. These sequences seem to me to fall into five different categories. First, there are numerous sequences here that are also listed in one of the C1-C3 clusters—three sequences from C1 (EPI_ISL_18415832, EPI_ISL_18415854, EPI_ISL_18798234), three from C2 (EPI_ISL_18040349, EPI_ISL_18060516, EPI_ISL_18106303, EPI_ISL_18116248), and four from C3 (EPI_ISL_18821484, EPI_ISL_18821485, EPI_ISL_18821487). Second, nine of the sequences appear to be fairly unremarkable XDD sequences, which is a designated JN.1/EG.5.1.1 recombinant (EPI_ISL_18617332, EPI_ISL_18706019, EPI_ISL_18706171, EPI_ISL_18553650, EPI_ISL_18653986, EPI_ISL_18531477, EPI_ISL_18569411, EPI_ISL_18695627). The third category consists of what seem to me to be relatively normal sequences from a variety of Omicron lineages but with little resemblance to BA.2.86. Some of them have extensive dropout and come from labs known for high rates of artifacts and contamination. (EPI_ISL_18076898, EPI_ISL_17990180,  EPI_ISL_18062641, EPI_ISL_18000549, EPI_ISL_18042058, EPI_ISL_18104305, EPI_ISL_18070023, EPI_ISL_18044667, EPI_ISL_18111437, EPI_ISL_15153261, EPI_ISL_17255807, EPI_ISL_15153261, EPI_ISL_16282414, EPI_ISL_16457740) The fourth category is BA.2.86 or JN.1 sequences that either don't strike me as very unusual or else have extensive dropout and artifactual reversions. A few of these are from unreliable labs. (EPI_ISL_18097345, EPI_ISL_18556860, EPI_ISL_18567791, EPI_ISL_18682823, EPI_ISL_18705393, EPI_ISL_18635682, EPI_ISL_18503709, EPI_ISL_18400531, EPI_ISL_18717823, EPI_ISL_18446586, EPI_ISL_18584588, EPI_ISL_18631046, EPI_ISL_18700743, EPI_ISL_18675075, EPI_ISL_18659819, EPI_ISL_18713456, EPI_ISL_18636806, EPI_ISL_18704459, EPI_ISL_18686183) The fifth and largest category is highly divergent sequences almost certainly deriving from chronic infections, but which appear to me to bear almost no resemblance to BA.2.86 apart from the possession of a few mutations that are widely convergent in such sequences. I've documented most of these, and almost all contain a large number of mutations and deletions not found in BA.2.86 and lack the vast majority of BA.2.86 mutations. I hope I haven't misinterpreted any of the authors' hypotheses or data. -Ryan Hisner",2024-07-23T16:03:09,ryhisner,ryhisner,10.1101/2024.07.18.604213,Early evolution of the BA.2.86 variant sheds light on the origins of highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 lineages,"Marina Escalera-Zamudio, Cedric C S Tan, Lucy van Dorp, François Balloux",2024-07-19

Although there are many studies reporting LT efficacy using simulated data (i.e., growth models), as well as studies using pots and small mini-lysimeters (most in the glasshouse), in my view there are only two studies that have done a fair job of testing LT trait efficacy empirically in the field – Zaman-Allah et al. 2011 (DOI: 10.1093/jxb/err139) and Borrell et al. 2014 (DOI: 10.1111/nph.12869).  Of these two, Zaman-Allah et al. 2011 is probably the most convincing for me because it does what I think a test of this theory needs to do – demonstrate inverse correlation between early season water use and late season growth and/or yield across many genotypes, which is what we should expect if there is anything to this idea at all.  Although I think there are problems with the Zaman-Allah study, e.g., no leaf-level water use measurements and the use of mini-lysimeters, I think these authors largely avoided the errors of earlier and later efforts by examining many genotypes, and using very large mini-lysimeters, which likely avoided disruption of soil water uptake, root growth, and saturated soil water profiles. I think it should absolutely worry us that although limited transpiration theory is now over 50 years old (e.g., de Wit 1958, Nix 1975, Passioura 1972 & 1977), there are no other convincing empirical demonstrations of its efficacy across most soils and climates, which includes most agriculturally important soils and climates world wide.  Similar to the opportunity costs we should expect associated with reduced early season carbon income in plants (which are almost completely ignored in the LT literature), there are also opportunity costs to funding LT research where LT traits are unlikely to result in improved outcomes.  The most important of these being that potentially more promising traits and trait networks are not considered, evaluated, and targeted in breeding programs.",2024-07-23T01:54:17,disqus_EBNdeyhDEC,sean gleason,10.1101/2024.06.27.601079,"A test of limited transpiration traits in sorghum to improve late-season water use, photosynthesis, growth, and grain yield in the high plains of Northern Colorado","Sean M.

AI has provided the blue print for an artificial protein situated outside of evolved life. The marine organisms that actually evolved molecules to transduce blue wavelengths of light into longer wavelengths of other colors and reemit them for a reason having to do with natural selection have done it already. They evolved the fluorescent molecules. ESM3's value is solely commercial, and no doubt it will be a hop, skip and jump from making the sequence available to researchers to commercializing it as contrast dye. Its origins will soon be forgotten, but its effects on the environment, and therefore life, will undoubtedly be persistent and deleterious. Wrapping the report in intellectual arguments about evolution doesn't scientifically validate the claim that an AI-generated mutant is ""evolved"". Even if the AI endgame was reached--replacing all life with a human-devised approximation, and it was somehow achieved by pseudo-evolution--ESM3 would still have no evolutionary value since it was synthesized in isolation.

Specifically, it focuses on the regulation of lipid metabolism via DH44 neuroendocrine cells. It is a follow-up on the work from the same lab where they showcased the importance of  TRP gamma in DH44 cells in regulating post-ingestive food selection (Dhakal et al 2022: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56726). Overall, this work adds to the growing body of work on DH44 neuroendocrine cells which appear to be crucial internal metabolic sensors. We have a few major comments and suggestions on the preprint which could help clarify the mechanisms by which TRP gamma regulates lipid metabolism. 1.	TRP gamma mutants exhibit higher TAG and protein levels compared to controls. Inhibition of DH44 neurons using Kir2.1 recaptiulates the phenotype of increased TAG however protein levels are unaffected. Since these manipulations are not restricted to the adult stage, it is not possible to rule out developmental defects. It would be beneficial to also include the fly weight for these manipulations to see if their size is altered by these manipulations. Also, is there any impact on developmental timing? 2.	The experiments implicating the role of AMPK in DH44 neurons are quite interesting. However, the link between TRP gamma activation, AMPK and DH44 signaling is missing. How is DH44 release altered when TRP gamma is knocked down specifically in DH44 neurons? 3.	The author rescue the increased TAG levels in TRP gamma mutants by driving UAS-TRP expression using DH44-GAL4. However, they also able to rescue the phenotype by expressing UAS-TRP in DH44-R2 expressing cells. As far as we are aware, DH44 and DH44-R2 represent two independent populations. This raises some questions. What is the identity of the DH44-R2 cells which normally express TRP? What is the importance of having TRP gamma in both the source (DH44 cells) and the target (DH44-R2 cells) to regulate lipid homeostasis? Wouldn’t modulation of DH44 release alone be sufficient to regulate lipid homeostasis? 4.	DH44 is released as a hormone from both the PI neurons in the brain and endocrine cells in the VNC ( https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-017-2682-y). Neither this or the previous study on TRP gamma in DH44 neurons examined the presence or absence of TRP gamma in DH44 neurons the VNC. It is not clear if the DH44-GAL4 used in this study targets the DH44 neurons in the VNC. 5.	General comment about structure: The manuscript could benefit if additional context was provided for some of the experiments. The experiments using metformin are interesting and a valuable addition. However, since the link between metformin and DH44 signaling was not explored, the rationale for conducting these experiments is not quite clear. Is the rescue of TAG levels with metformin in TRP gamma mutants DH44-dependent or is metformin directly acting on the fat body? Metformin treatment in DH44 > TRP RNAi flies can clarify this. 6.	The manuscript would benefit from having a model which includes all the components in this inter-organ pathway (TRP gamma, DH44 neurons, gut etc). Minor comment: 1.

Briefly, further investigation (using cov-spectrum and UShER phyloplace) identified four sequences from Mayasia with March 2022 collection dates containing both M:D3H and M:T30A: EPI_ISL_18821484 (in C3) EPI_ISL_18821485 (in C3) EPI_ISL_18821546 EPI_ISL_18821638 These all share G19677T, which is a mutation characterizing BA.2.40 in Malaysia which was common in March 2022 (760 out of 855 sequences worldwide with G19677T were found in Malaysia that month; 52% of sequences from from Sarawak, Malaysia collected in March 2022 have this mutation). Further, the three sequences that are placed by phyloplace are found together with other sequences from Malaysia. This identifies another sequence with M:D3H and M:T30A sampled in Malaysia, EPI_ISL_18821317. Other mutations in these sequences are shared with various other lineages prevalent in Malaysia in March 2022. One sequence with M:D3H and M:T30A, EPI_ISL_18821638, could not be placed by phyloplace, but NextClade calls it as BA.1.1 because it contains the BA.1-defining EPE insert in S. The manuscript notes, regarding the period of Omicron emergence, ""South Africa and Botswana, where genomic surveillance was more robust than in many other parts of Africa."" BA.2.86 emergence in Southern Africa is well supported: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43703-3 It is implausible that an intermediate between BA.2 and BA.2.86 would recombine with multiple lineages circulating in Malaysia and only be detected in Malaysia without leaving a trace in southern Africa given that this surveillance continued. Rather, I suspect that these observations are likely artifacts arising from processing samples collected in March 2022 together with samples collected in late 2023. This can be tested by comparing mutations in these sequences to those observed in BA.2.86* strains common in Malaysia in late 2023. The most common of these is JN.1, which contains S:L455S as well as the S deletion shown for the C3 sequences here.",2024-07-20T14:19:32,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,10.1101/2024.07.18.604213,Early evolution of the BA.2.86 variant sheds light on the origins of highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 lineages,"Marina Escalera-Zamudio, Cedric C S Tan, Lucy van Dorp, François Balloux",2024-07-19

Macdonald (UCSF) Summary: Fusion oncoproteins occurring from genomic rearrangements are commonly observed in cancers and often drive oncogenesis. Although these fusions frequently involve kinases or transcription factors, they are a diverse group at both molecular and functional levels, and a unified description of their oncogenetic properties is lacking. Robust methods for predicting oncogenicity of unknown fusions would be immediately clinically useful, making this an important gap. At a more basic level, this points to a gap in our ability to describe a key biological phenomenon. Some recent work has tackled this problem by examining the physicochemical properties of fusion oncoproteins, notably [1], but this is essentially still an open question. In this manuscript, the authors present a language model of fusion oncoproteins, FusOn-pLM, by fine-tuning ESM-2 with two recent databases of human fusion oncoproteins. They compare random masking vs. one using their previous fine-tuned ESM-2 model SaLT&PepPr and benchmark their results on a number of tasks, demonstrating reasonably increased specificity on specific tasks and improvement with non-random masking. The model training and benchmarking are sound and convincingly demonstrate the improvement. Despite this, the lack of clarity about what unifies fusion oncogenes is a major challenge. Language models can be powerful ways to learn these sorts of definitions in a less biased way, and in that light this is an important step towards clarifying this basic gap. However, as written, the work uses a working definition of fusion oncogene that is based on physicochemical properties that may or may not be specific to oncogenes. Examining the benchmarking tasks the authors use makes this clearer: they are almost entirely predictions of condensate and IDR properties rather than oncogenetic ones. The one truly cancer-specific benchmark, differentiating carcinoma classes, is fairly narrow and no model performs particularly well here. As a result, we are unsure how strongly this model will perform in discrimination or generalization tasks. Another general problem for the field is the lack of negative controls. Gene fusions are relatively common mutations, but bona fide oncogenic fusions are a small fraction of all fusions, making this a class imbalance problem. Even within tumors, the majority of fusions are thought to be passengers rather than driver mutations. Any predictor should be able to discriminate between these, but the lack of good data on non-oncogenetic fusions makes this challenging. This is evident in this work, where the model’s discrimination is not strongly tested. In summary, we believe this is technically strong work which addresses a pressing need, and which also presents some general strategies for domain-specific language model fine-tuning, but which is unfortunately hamstrung by defects in the available data and conceptualization of the field that are outside of the authors’ control. As presented, it will be of interest to AI practitioners and oncofusion researchers, but the clinical utility is unclear. Major points: 1) As discussed, we think the concept of an “oncofusion” is somewhat diffuse, as it describes an extremely heterogeneous set of proteins. This makes the prediction task particularly difficult. While the introduction discusses the barriers to prediction of fusion oncoproteins due to their intrinsically disordered regions and large size, we believe a bit more care with the effective definition they are using is warranted. Related to this is the choice of FOdb to train their model, which is essentially a database of condensate properties of oncofusions rather than oncogenetic ones. The implications of this choice also warrant a bit more discussion. 2) We wonder if there is a class imbalance problem. The databases used to fine-tune their model have a small fraction of possible fusion proteins, and don’t contain large amounts of negative training information. We are thus unsure if FusOn-pLM’s significant improvements over ESM-2 are specific to driver fusion oncogenes. 3) The method is not contextualized with respect to prior work in computational oncofusion prediction and characterization. Such methods are few ([2],[3],[4],[5],[6] among others) but important to understand FusOn-pLM’s performance. 4) Several experimental datasets for fusion oncogenes have been published, including [7], [5], and [8]. FusON-pLM’s performance on these would be a compelling way to show its utility, as well as a more specific oncogenetic task. Minor points: 1) Figure 2D: Although FusON-pLM is doing a slightly better job at distinguishing carcinoma prediction into two classes (BRCA vs. STAD), the performance metrics are the worst across the board. What does this mean for the prediction problem overall? Does the fact that IDR and condensate properties are much better predicted mean that the model is actually not learning an oncogenetic task? This seems worthy of more discussion. 2) Figure 4A: The authors present a FusOn-pLM embedding visualization of fusion oncoproteins, along with the corresponding head and tail protein sequences. It would be beneficial to clarify whether the protein sequences used for the head and tail counterparts are full-length sequences or only up to the exon breakpoint that forms the chimeric fusion protein. This information can be included in the Materials and Methods section. 3) Figure 4A: The authors demonstrate that FusON-pLM is able to separate out fusions from their head and tail components. To demonstrate that it is learning more specific embeddings for fusion oncoproteins, a comparison of the embeddings with untuned ESM-2 would be appropriate. 4) Figure 4B: In the main text of results section the authors write “FusOn-pLM largely clusters sequences by key properties such as the fraction of polar, charged, and disordered residues as well as the propensity to form pi-pi and pi-cation interactions and prion-like domains, via the PLAC NLLR score.” From the data shown in Figure 4B, this conclusion seems fine for polar residues and NLLR scores, but not for disordered residues and pi-pi/pi-cation interaction propensity by eye. Without quantification of the clustering, we are not sure this statement is supported. References: 1. 	Tripathi S, Shirnekhi HK, Gorman SD, Chandra B, Baggett DW, Park C-G, et al.

CRISPR gRNA vector wrongly including PAM sequence, the consequence should say ""gRNA plasmid becomes target of CRISPR cleavage"" with the caveat that this would only be the case if the wrongly included PAM is followed by another PAM, which is not the case in many CRISPR plasmids such as the pX330 derived ones.  This would obviously affect cleaving at the target if its PAM is not followed by a second PAM. While some errors in the table are almost certainly errors in design (ex stop codons before a 2A sequence, mutations in ITRs, etc...) I'm curious why some of the other design ""errors"" are deemed errors.  For example, using CMV in AAV vectors can be a perfectly acceptable choice depending on the use of the virus, especially if it isn't intended for long term expression.  Likewise, use of ""unstable"" sequences in high copy plasmids can be a problem, however if those plasmids are maintained in bacteria that maintain plasmids at a low copy (Epi400, Stbl2, etc...), the replication origin of the plasmid becomes less relevant as the copy number becomes more dependent on the host strain.
