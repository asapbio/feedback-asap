Chargaff circa 1950 discovered that DNA base composition (not sequence) was a species characteristic, simply expressed as GC% (as opposed to AT%). 2. So, there were GC%-rich species and AT%-rich species, with the exact values differing between species. 3. We biochemists and others discovered circa 1990 that actually the difference was due to short sequences (k-mers). 4. Thus, for k=3. GC%-rich species would be enriched in GTC, GGA, GGC, CAG, etc. Whereas for an AT-rich species ACT, AAG, AAT, TGA, etc. 5. Given 4 bases (A, C, G, T), for k=2 there would be 4x4 = 16 possibilities. For k=3 there would be 4x4x4 = 64 possibilities. 6. In practice the range varies from k=3 to k=8. 7. Fragments of DNA from, say, a soil sample, will correspond to a variety of species in the sample. But just by assessing the k-mer patterns in the fragments, those corresponding to each species can be identified. 8. Then you can look at the fragments corresponding to one species and examine long sections to identify gene sequences (viewed as ""sentences"" or ""word strings""). 9. So, k-mers can be seen as the ""accent"" or ""dialect"" of DNA that relates to what species it belongs to. Unless you take that into account you cannot make a new species by just inserting a few genes to change appearance. 10. Just as accent can influence reproductive choices between humans (remember Eliza Doolittle), so it influences the reproductive isolation that is the defining characteristic of a species.

I have a few questions related to the benchmark.  The comparison between PanSpace and GSearch for space requirement is not clear to me because it says very clear in the abstract of GSearch paper that, it only requires 2.5G space using the SetSketch option, which is around 6G only for AllThebacteria, but not 80G for the default ProbMinHash option. ProbMinHash is very space inefficient since it considered all kmers and their abundance while SetSketch is very space efficient and also fast (not so fast as the fastest option Densified MinHash). Also, for genus level classification, GSearch can be done in amino acid space (after predicting genes), which ANI in nt space will lose accuracy (a well know problem). Can the genus level benchmark be done also in amino acid space, which is also clearly there in abstract (3-step framework). Thanks!

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.27.640495v2#comment-6686539507,biorxivstage,2,"The manuscript by Azulay et al. investigates the cooperative interaction between Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) strain 10403S and its prophage ɸ10403S. The authors identify and characterize a novel anti-phage defense system that is encoded in the genome of the prophage focusing on the ORF65 protein renamed TerI (for terminase inhibitor). The study shows that TerI inhibits phage reproduction by targeting the phage terminase complex of invading phages, thus preventing the packaging of phage DNA. Azulay et al. also discover two other prophage encoded proteins that provide the phage with immunity against its own TerI protein and thus enable packaging of its own genetic material. This preprint is well-written and contains high-quality data that advances the field of phage biology and anti-phage defense systems. We provide below some suggestions to strengthen the methodology, and to increase the clarity in the interpretation of the results. Major comments A loading control is required in Figure 1B, 2F, 2G, and 4D to verify that the amount of protein entered into each well is the same either using an antibody against a protein that does not change or using Coomassie or Ponceau stain of the membrane. Additionally, relative quantification (to the loading control) of immunoblots would be helpful to measure the loss of ORF65 co-sedimentation in the ΔterSL mutant (Figure 2G) to strengthen the finding that ORF65/TerI interacts with TerS. For Figure 2F, a quantification of the immunoblot, ideally including a dilution series, would further support the statement that both the bacterial strains, expressing ORF65 or not, produced or released a similar number of capsids. Page 11: “ectopic expression of each of these genes alone (i.e., without TerI expression) did not affect virion production, as compared to WT bacteria, suggesting that the encoded proteins play a specific role in neutralizing TerI.” In Figure 3D, the ectopic expression of LMRG_01518 shows a large standard deviation reaching about 50%WT in PFU, suggesting that overexpression of LMRG_01518 may impact virion production. We recommend showing individual data points of each replicate and to provide a possible explanation for this high standard deviation. Page 12: “Altogether, these findings indicated that TerI is fully active during 10403S induction and that LMRG_01518 and LMRG_02984 counteract its activity, functioning as self-immunity proteins that allow 10403S DNA packaging and virion assembly”. However, only LMRG_02984 directly interacts with TerI and not LMRG_01518 (Figure 3H). This data may explain the stronger phage ɸ10403S rescue consistently observed when LMRG_02984 is present compared to LMRG_01518 (Figure 3E). There is a question as to whether the results, as currently reported, fully support the direct interaction of LMRG_01518 with TerI. The study could incorporate a BACTH assay between LMRG_02984 and LMRG_01518 to support that conclusion, or the text could be revised to ensure the conclusions tightly align to the findings currently included (e.g. the model in Figure 5 depicts direct interaction between anti-TerI1(01518) and TerI). The discussion, while well-written, reads more like a minireview and could focus more on the findings. It could be expanded by elaborating more on the data presented and how it supports the model presented in Figure 5. Of particular interest is the discussion of LMRG_01518 inhibiting TerI function although not interacting with TerI directly. Other interesting points to discuss include the specificity of the TerI/anti-TerI1, I2 system, could the invading phage encode anti-TerI as well? How about the TerI/TerS specificity, from the data presented, it seems that TerI is able to inhibit TerS from different phages. Is there anything known about the function of LMRG_01518 and LMRG_02984 besides their role as anti-TerI? On Figure 3C, it seems that expression of LMRG_01517 largely decreases PFU compared to control, this result could be discussed. We realize it is beyond the scope of this study, but it would be of interest to perform a BLAST search with terI. This novel anti-phage defense system might be used by other temperate phages in other bacteria. It would be interesting to see how many other phages use this system. Or perhaps this is something exclusive to the Lm phages? Minor comments - Page 6: could you explain the choice of not using the his-tagged ORF65 from Figure 1E and on. We understand this may be technically difficult due to lack of specific antibodies against TerI and anti-TerI1 and 2, but something that was not obvious to us was whether the ectopic expression of ORF65 resulted in overexpression compared to endogenous levels in WT and whether exogenous infection leads to anti-terI1 and anti-terI2 expression. Figure 1F, we would have expected higher PFU than WT in the ATG*orf65 if ORF65 is present in WT to prevent virion production, and Figure 1G, we would have expected some level of PFU if anti-TerI are present to counteract TerI. There is a sentence that could be clarified “To this end, we infected Lm bacteria cured of ɸ10403S and deleted the comKgene with free particles of ɸ10403S in the presence or absence of orf65 ectopic expression (i.e…).” Consider breaking it into two: “We made ΔcomK Lm bacteria cured of ɸ10403S (Lm Δɸ10403S-ΔcomK). We then infected Lm Δɸ10403S-ΔcomK with ɸ10403S particles in the presence or absence of orf65 ectopic expression…” - Page 11: could you clarify the following sentence “cro (corresponding to the first early gene)” and define the acronym cro in the first instance. It is not clear to us whether cro itself is considered an early gene as it represses early genes. - Methods: could you describe how the ATG*orf65 mutation was exactly made and explain the choice of this mutation as opposed to deleting the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the rpsD promoter (if it contains one). Could you also explain why the mutagenesis of the -10 box of the orf65 promoter involved 5 bases and not less. - Figure 1A (and 3A): LMRG_01515 is labeled as LMRG_1515, include the missing zero in the locus number. - Figure 1C, 1E, 2C, 2D: plot growth curves on a log scale rather than linear as it is standard in the field. - Figure 1F, 3C, 3D: y-axis of PFU (% WT) needs to be consistent and should be put on a linear scale rather than a logarithmic scale as it is standard in the field. Provide number of replicates in the panel (such as N = 3). - Figure 1H: clarify which ones are lytic or temperate (prophages) in the panel by adding labels below the phage names. Also, keep consistent the nomenclature of the phages in the text to match figures (phage names missing phi symbol in text). - Figure 2F: could you explain the choice of quantifying attP rather than attB. - Figure 2E: increase scale size and keep panel sizes consistent and aligned. - Figure 2G: explain the low level of ORF65 detected in the ΔΦ pellet in the first panel. Are the ΔterS and ΔterL mutants available, it would be of interest to test these as well to strengthen the BACTH assay in Figure 2H showing direct interaction with TerS but not L. This may be technically challenging, but all samples could be run on one gel to produce one blot, if possible, for ease of comparison. - Figure 3: for consistency in the panels presented, the nomenclature used to describe LMRG_02984 and LMRG_01518 should not be changed to anti-TerI1 and anti-TerI2. - Figure 3A: make the phage genome image larger and include description in the legend. - Figure 3H: LMRG_01518 was included as part of the negative controls.

However, it should be noted that the relationship between genotype and phenotype isn’t fully understood. Also, we know from other ancient DNA studies that the derived alleles in genes SLC24A5 and SLC45A2 associated with light skin pigmentation in Europeans today were either fixed or at high frequency in the Neolithic Anatolian population. Previous studies have linked the introduction of light skin in western, central and southern Europe as coming with the Neolithic Anatolian farmers. Eastern hunter-gatherers seem to have carried these alleles already, so Eastern Europe and Scandinavia followed a different trend. Your method predicted darker skin in the Neolithic Anatolians based on genomes that have already been published, which contradicts the original research, but you ignored this in your paper. The earlier findings need to be taken into consideration here - why does your method contradict these findings? And if you deem your method superior, then how and when did these alleles get introduced in western/southern Europe if it wasn’t with the Anatolian farmers? And why did your method predict darker skin pigmentation in this population when they carried the same derived alleles as modern Europeans?",2025-04-08T12:36:14,,MM,10.1101/2025.01.29.635495,Inference of human pigmentation from ancient DNA by genotype likelihood,"Silvia Perretti, Maria Teresa Vizzari, Patrícia Santos, Enrico Tassani, Andrea Benazzo, Silvia Ghirotto, Guido Barbujani",2025-02-12

Promega also conveniently doesn't mention that the readily available and cheaper bis-CTZ can be used with Nanoluc with very similar results (though, Satoshi Inouye had reported this in 2013). For years, I've been asking around in the bioluminescence if someone has determined it but no one did. Eventually, I've realized that I can simply determine it from absorbance. ""When you understand the laws of physics, anything is possible"" #TBBT. 🎆 All the four compounds (CTZ, bis-CTZ, CTZ-h, frZ) and many other cœlenterazine-derived compounds have the same core set of conjugated double bonds which gives them an absorbance peak around 425-440 nm and, hence, a yellow color: see the linked slide with spectra of CTZ, bis-CTZ and furimazine. So, it seems that one can safely use the same molar absorption coefficient for all of them. I like to use ε=10000 L/(mol⋅cm) in ethanol (or methanol) since batches of CTZ and bis-CTZ of high purity can slightly exceed this value according to their certificates of analysis (see the linked image). The furimazine solution in the spectra illustration was diluted from the N1110 reagent stock (catalog # N113A tube in this kit) For Promega reagents, such measurements give 3.42 mM furimazine for the "" Nano-Glo® Luciferase Assay System"" ( catalog # N1110 - used in this preprint) and 0.58 mM furimazine for the "" Nano-Glo® Live Cell Assay System"" ( catalog # N2011). So, the 1:500 dilution is 6.8 μM furimazine, 1:1000 - 3.4 μM, 1:100 dilution is 34 μM furimazine.",2025-04-07T01:00:17,michaelkoksharov,Misha Koksharov,10.1101/2023.06.25.546478,CaBLAM!

The draft provides good arguments about the importance of developing and the capabilities of denoising methods to improve the quality of high-resolution fMRI data. To further strengthen the impact of this work, we would suggest openly sharing the code with the fMRI community. We believe that there is a high need for improvement in data quality that may come not only from better data acquisition but also from data denoising. If code becomes available, we would love to explore this methodology on our own datasets.

The work is of great relevance in the field of extracellular vesicles (EVs), as it explores the role of the SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) pathway in the packaging of post-translational proteins in these structures. The data corroborate other studies that seek to understand the packaging mechanisms of extracellular vesicles that can influence the function of vesicles and, consequently, their interaction with target cells, such as in astrocytes, enriching the knowledge of how these pathways are involved in the construction of EVs and modifications, in this case protein modifications. One detail that caught my attention was the terms used and I would like to comment on a few things: Extracellular vesicles are complex structures that carry information in cellular communication, being responsible for the exchange of molecules between cells, including proteins, lipids, and genetic material. Their function in cellular communication depends on the specific composition of each vesicle, which can vary depending on the type of cell that releases it, for example in the modulation of biological processes, such as the immune response. In addition, the field of study with EV is being increasingly explored, precisely because these small structures are mediators in such important functions in target cells 1,2. However, it is still an area that is expanding and many terms, nomenclatures, and methodologies are still being discussed. Therefore, the use of more general terms involving location, group, and nomenclatures can be strategic to avoid having data invalidated in the future. For example, today the nomenclature “microvesicles” has been invalidated, “exosomes” discouraged and “extracellular vesicles” is well accepted according to MISEV (Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles)3. Another suggestion is to be cautious when declaring the position of the components of these structures if there is no data presented that confirms whether it is inside, on the surface or if it is transmembrane in these released structures. I suggest that the authors perform an assay that really shows the location of the protein. The viability data should be presented in a graph to support the integrity of the extracellular vesicles obtained. Another control that I believe should be incorporated is the graph of the populations (size and quantity) by NTA obtained from a portion of the sample of extracellular vesicles used in the functional assay, with the corresponding results. Thus, the quantity of extracellular vesicles used can be calculated and also corroborates that the quantity of vesicles does not interfere with the effect on astrocytes, but rather on the proteins involved in SUMOylation. Finally, when performing functional assays with extracellular vesicles, it is important to incorporate rigorous controls to validate the results. The viability of the cells subjected to vesiculation can also be assessed using rezasurin, and data on the size and quantity of EVs can be presented using NTA (Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis) graphs to ensure that the samples used in the functional assays followed a methodology for good purification and preservation of the integrity of these vesicles. Since storage at -80°C can compromise the bilayer of the EV membrane, the results obtained for size and quantity may change, as well as the form of communication with the target cell of the assay. Immunofluorescence assays can complement the data and elucidate how these EVs interact with the target cell: membrane-membrane contact, fusion between membranes or internalization of these structures. These controls will allow a more accurate assessment of EV functionality and contribute to the understanding of their mechanisms of action. In addition, they can also open new research possibilities, such as the evaluation of the impact of EVs formed by the SUMO pathway in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, where cellular communication and protein accumulation play key roles in disease progression. Studies in the literature mention disease progression related to the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein and other factors still under investigation, such as changes in the protein profile and receptors of microglia.

The argument made by the authors is that using CCA on the delay 1 and delay 2 activities identified ""a low-dimensional latent space where consistent coding could be preserved over time."" But using CCA identifies two different subspaces (one for each input, in this case delay1 and delay2 activity) to maximize the correlation. E.g., it could be the subspace for delay1 is neurons 1 2 and 3, whereas for delay2 it's neurons 4 5 and 6.

DHRS7 Integrates NADP+ 1 /NADPH Redox Sensing with Inflammatory Li2 pid Signalling via the Oxoeicosanoid Pathway Yanan Ma1 , King Lam Hui1 , Yohannes A. Ambaw1 , Tobias C. Walther1,3 3 , Robert V. Farese, Jr1 , Miklos Lengyel1 , Zaza Gelashvili1,2 , Dajun Lu1 , and Philipp Niethammer1,4 Reviewer Team: Lucas Athayde, Rosangela Silva Santos, Sara Ventura. Summary Employing a variety of methodological approaches including structural modeling, phylogenetics, gene silencing, and mass spectrometry, the authors investigate 5- HEDH activity in A549 cells, an enzyme associated with lipid dehydrogenation that leads to 5-KETE formation. After confirming 5-HEDH activity through detection of its reversible oxidation products, 5-KETE and 5-HETE, the study proceeds with a gene-level investigation and screening for potential microsomal dehydrogenases involved in this lipid peroxidation. Additionally, the authors provide insights that may extend to other types of cells, as evidenced by functional studies in zebrafish. The authors uncover the role of DHRS7 in redox signaling, demonstrating its NADPH-dependent regulation of 5-KETE production. Unlike classical redox signaling based on thiol oxidation, they present DHRS7 as a redox-regulated enzyme that acts in 5-KETE biosynthesis, which is a highly novel and interesting mechanism. Under stress conditions, DHRS7 facilitates rapid inflammatory signaling and leukocyte recruitment through the 5-KETE pathway. Major Comments Identification of DHRS7 as a 5-HEDH Candidate The screening successfully identified DHRS7 as a candidate enzyme with 5- HEDH activity. LC-MS profiling of wild-type cell lines revealed increased 5-KETE levels in cells exposed to 5-HEDE and vice versa, with a stronger effect observed in 5-KETE accumulation. Surprisingly, 5-KETE production appeared to be favored under non-stress conditions. We would like to see a description of the data normalization to exclude the possibility that these differences arise from variations in cell viability, abundance, or any other experimental conditions. Alternative Pathways and Metabolic Compensation Another observation is the reduction in 5-KETE and 5-HETE levels in DHRS7 knockout cells, corroborating the proposed DHRS7 role. But the persistence of these metabolites in silenced cells even at lower concentrations is curious, which leads to a few hypotheses such as the activation of endogenous compensatory mechanisms and exogenous uptake of these metabolites from the media. To further investigate the origin of these residual metabolite levels, it is essential to quantify 5-KETE and 5-HETE in the culture medium to test if the cells' knockouts exposure to these lipids could explain these residual levels. To evaluate if these residual metabolites could have originated from endogenous mechanisms, a transcriptome analysis could be used to identify other redox-active enzymes differentially expressed that could exhibit potential 5-HEDH activity thereby compensating DHRS7 silencing. Subcellular Localization of DHRS7 The authors employed GFP-tagged DHRS7 constructs for subcellular localization and genetic complementation assays in DHRS7 KO A549 cells and zebrafish Dhrs7 KO models. This strategy successfully restored the wild-type phenotype, as evidenced by increased 5-HETE and 5-KETE levels upon treatment with precursors, corroborating the initial hypothesis of DRS7 as a 5-HEDH. However, the conclusion that DHRS7 localizes to microsomes lacks experimental validation, as no microsomal markers were used in confocal imaging. Indeed, cellular fractionation and Western blot assays indicate DHRS7 also localized in the nucleus, granules, and microsomes, but GFP fluorescence was absent in the nucleus. Given that the antibody used for Western blotting was available, it’s not clear why the authors did not employ an anti-DHRS7 antibody for immunofluorescence to precisely determine its intracellular distribution rather than relying on GFP-based localization assays. Kinetic Characterization of DHRS7 Activity The authors conducted enzymatic kinetics assays for DHRS7 and applied a Michaelis-Menten model for data fitting. However, the fitting shows clear deviations, with a notably low coefficient of determination (R²), suggesting that this model may not adequately describe DHRS7’s catalytic properties. In fact, a typical Michaelian model does not appear to fit the data distribution. To ensure that these discrepancies are not due to experimental artifacts, we recommend repeat the experiments performing additional replicates. Furthermore, considering the probable reversibility of 5-KETE conversion, alternative kinetic models that account for this factor should be explored. Minor Comments ● Lines 13-15: The authors state, ""As the DHRS7 (but not DHRS3) knockdown effect was consistent with 5-HEDH activity, we tested whether DHRS7 also promoted 5-KETE reduction. This was the case."" However, Figure S1D shows a reduction in 5-HETE, not 5-KETE. More clarification is needed. ● Cell Line Justification: The authors discuss DHRS7 expression in various contexts but do not justify their choice of A549 cells. Since none of the cited references mention DHRS7 expression in this line, a description of the rationale for model choice is necessary. ● Figure 1E: We recommend a dose-time response curve for DOX treatment to monitor DHRS7 expression levels. This would determine if DHRS7 expression remains at physiological levels or becomes supraphysiological, thereby ensuring that subsequent treatments also occur under physiological conditions. ● Figure 1F: We recommend a more clear description that these are cells lacking the DHRS7 construct to enhance reader understanding. ● Figure 2B: H₂O₂ is not a direct intermediate in the 5-HETE/5-KETE pathway, though it may indirectly influence it by activating 5-LOX, altering redox balance (NADP⁺/NADPH), and contributing to ferroptosis. The statement ""Lipid peroxidation stimulates 5-KETE production through DHRS7"" would be more robust if 5-LOX activity was assessed. We suggest a validation experiment: Treat DOX-induced DHRS7-expressing cells with H₂O₂ and measure markers of lipid peroxidation, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), isoprostanes, or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). This would confirm lipid peroxidation’s role in 5-KETE production. ● Figure 3D: Overexpression methodology in HEK cells is unclear. The knockout was achieved using CRISPR/Cas9, not shRNA. More clarification is needed on whether overexpression was introduced via a separate construct post-knockout, whether a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) or DOX-inducible system was used, or if overexpression was performed in a different cell line. ● Figure 4A: The heatmap visualization of metabolite concentrations was clear, but cluster analysis would provide more information related to the significance of observed alterations.",2025-03-24T20:40:02,,"Sara, Rosangela e Lucas",10.1101/2025.02.05.636725,DHRS7 Integrates NADP+/NADPH Redox Sensing with Inflammatory Lipid Signalling via the Oxoeicosanoid Pathway,"Yanan Ma, King Lam Hui, Yohannes A.

Perhaps recreate some of the tables and figures that GTDB makes https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/stats/r220 Thanks again for the great work! EDIT: I realized that you did not use GTDBtk to assign taxonomy but used Sylph. Then I guess you parsed the species name from the contigs? Unfortunately this will not provide the accurate taxonomy because GTDB does not correct the taxonomic names in each of the assemblies in the database. Very often the contig names and taxonomies do not match the taxonomy assigned by GTDB. This is a critical error in my opinion, but could be solved by simply building a table to associate the correct taxonomy for each contig. A better solution would be to run GTDB-tk on all the assemblies, but I understand this would take considerable time.",2025-03-21T15:31:16,peterdiebold,Peter Diebold,10.1101/2024.03.08.584059,"AllTheBacteria - all bacterial genomes assembled, available and searchable","Martin Hunt, Leandro Lima, Daniel Anderson, Jane Hawkey, Wei Shen, John Lees, Zamin Iqbal",2024-11-15
