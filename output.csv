A few comments and questions: Missing: citation to Berck, Khandelwal et al. 2016 eLife, which describes the connectome of the olfactory glomeruli of the antennal lobe of Drosophila larva. Note that Eichler et al. 2017 Nature describes the mushroom body connectome, not the olfactory glomeruli. Missing from the simulations are LN-LN synapses, LN-ORN synapses, and PN-LN dendro-dendritic synapses. Perhaps the SFA (spike frequency adaptation) models the LN-ORN synapse and possibly the PN-LN synapse in its role in driving the LN-PN and LN-ORN synapse? Why wasn't SFA implemented in PNs as well? Why only ORNs and KCs? What is the Q_0.75 ? Never defined. Which brain hemisphere was modeled, the left or the right? ""The ORN responses are phasic-tonic as a result of SFA."": what does this mean? From figure 2 one can infer perhaps an early strong onset of activity (the phasic part), followed by sustained but weaker activity (the tonic part). Could be explained rather than leave the reader to guess. In which figure is this shown: ""The integrated adaptation current that has reached a steady state during the odor stimulation period now decays only slowly, acting in a hyperpolarizing fashion and thus reducing spiking probability [52] of the ORNs."" Repeated word: ""on the the sparseness"" In Figure 3, rather than dynamite plots, it would be best to show the cloud of 20 dots, with some horizontal jitter, for each condition, to better visually assess the spread of the distributions. Typo: ""inhibtion"" Missing parentheses: ""for both chip Fig. 4 A,B,C and simulation Fig. 4 C,D,E."" That's very interesting: ""new neuromorphic circuit designs will be able to compensate for these drifts by using proper temperature compensated bias generator circuits [102]."" and it mirrors recent findings in Drosophila larvae where the temperature sensors for both cold and hot maintain homeostasis. Note the thermosensors communicate as well to the APL via PNs and two KCs per mushroom body, which happen to be the largests KCs in this animal.

It was indeed an insightful paper which has a remarkable application in future bio monitoring of terrestrials. It would have been nice to know the reasons behind using the specific COI forward and reverse primers in your experiment and some more information regarding the target genes. Also, hedgehogs that are present in the vicinity don't visit the zoo as they may be hibernating during winters, but will still keep physically shedding DNA in the air which may have been detected in your samples.

When analyzing what you are commenting upon I am curious as to why you chose to include the methods and materials section within the supplementary materials portion of you manuscript? I also am curious about the organoid model utilized to test this concept. Was there any other differences observed to make sense of the bone tissue migration compared to the breast cancer tissue migration? Does it overall seem like this process could very well happen in all types of cancer outside of the breast cancer cells tested? This specific data, while very important to understanding mechanistically what is going on with this mitochondrial transfer, I think needs more clarity quantitatively or qualitatively. If we were too look at this phenomenon in vivo are there going to be confounding factors that perhaps change this transfer process? This could potentially start to explain why there are differences in transference patterns observed between tissue types. I believe that overall this body of work is a great stepping stone for further investigation and understanding of what this process could mean for both ""healthy"" cells as well as ""diseased"" cells such as cancer cells as well as tissue health.",2021-10-26T02:55:59,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,,,,

I found the paper to be very well-structured and I think the organized layout of the paper helps build a narrative that can be read by a wider, non-scientific audience as well. It was interesting to find that neutrophils in older adults had increased uptake and oxidative capacity, compared to younger adults (Fig 2B). I liked that you referenced research articles with findings that were in contrast to your own finding regarding neutrophil oxidative capacity in older adults. I think including such references is a great way to avoid confirmation bias in research. I hope to see future studies that build upon this research theme by using cohorts that span the entire age range of 1-80 years. It would also be interesting to see the variation in dendritic cells and B cells at human nasal mucosa with age.  In addition to the challenge of obtaining human tissue samples, did you face any other challenges while investigating the immune cell composition at nasal mucosa?

Inclusion of immune cell composition and activation states provided an interesting gauge into the diminished nasal mucosal T cell reservoir, and perhaps overdependence on granulocyte function, in older adults. Has your group considered looking into Th17 subset composition amongst colonized and uncolonized children, young adults, and older adults? It would be immensely interesting to see if there would be a difference in Th17 populations within the nasal mucosa of older adults with or without S. pneumoniae colonization especially. As you point out in your paper, your group observed diminished T cell density and activation within older adults (Figures 1C, 1E, 1I), but did not include data on Th17 composition or Th17-producing cytokines such as IL-17, IL-21, or IL-22, although I may have missed this.

The paper certainly supports the authors’ argument of needing further mucosal studies to understand the changes in immune responses and risk of individuals with age. The key findings of reduced granulocytes and T cells in children and older adults respectively suggest new directions to explore the increased susceptibility to infections in these individuals. The figures were beautiful representations of the results and great analysis. The only source of confusion I encountered are the monocyte and neutrophil functional blood assays. Since it is presented in the abstract and experimentally shown in the latter figures that the immune functions in the blood are not reflected in the mucosal tissues, how is the importance of these functional blood assays to the paper justified?

Thank you for contributing to global terrestrial biomonitoring and ecological analysis. Using airDNA as a biomonitoring tool under natural settings show great potential. The decline in biodiversity throughout the world urges the development of non-invasive techniques that could offer rapid and accurate results. Your study successfully reveals the power of airDNA sampling at distance, and from my perspective, the new technique would truly revolutionize terrestrial biodiversity surveys. My question would be, do you anticipate any difference of conducting airDNA sampling between zoo setting and real natural environment? As in the zoo, animals are gathering together and each kind of them have their own enclosures. While in the natural environment, animals will move more freely as there will be no space limit. Also, we know that some endangered species actually live under extreme conditions. For example, the weather might be extreme. Will the study results be influenced by extreme weathers? Moreover, I am wondering if we need more intermediate steps to shift from zoo setting to actual field as zoo setting can evoke less complex behaviors and is still involved by human. Since we are aiming at non-invasive technique, what future steps could be done? All in all, I think the paper makes significant contribution to the biomonitoring field, the methodology is quite convincing. I am just curious about the actual application of airDNA in the wild and the future plans regarding this study.

Not to mention, the production of a shelf-stable, oral vaccine would be a great contribution to current global vaccination efforts. The experiment design was planned and executed well to imitate and evaluate post-vaccination transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, after thoroughly reading the paper, I was left searching for answers that would provide clarity to readers such as myself should they be addressed. The first is regarding the use of an adenovirus type 5 vector when a large proportion of the population already has natural immunity to this serotype. Is there a benefit to using this vector as opposed to another subtype with less seroprevalence in the population? The second unanswered question is regarding the IM vaccine used. Why was a SARS-CoV-1 spike protein vaccine used instead of a vaccine that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, such as one of the current mRNAs vaccines currently in use? My third unanswered question is regarding the high virus titer used to inoculate index hamsters. What was the rationale behind inoculating hamsters with a high physiological dose as opposed to a moderate dose that may better represent the amount that humans are actually exposed to? A thought, not a question, but many of the experiments performed on samples were collected at several timepoints, yet the sVNT was performed at only 1 timepoint following full vaccination. It would have been informative had the sVNT been performed on samples from week 4 to determine the neutralizing ability of antibodies in between vaccinations and to compare to IgA and IgG levels which were determined at that time point. As a final lingering question, IN- and oral- vaccinated index hamsters inoculated with the high dose viral titer showed more effective viral clearance than naïve hamsters that were exposed to these same index hamsters in the aerosol chambers. And as seen in figures 4b-g, though high viral and infectious viral loads were detected in the naïve hamsters they were protected from severe clinical disease outcomes at day 5 post-challenge. However, the same data from figure 4 b-d also seem to show that the unvaccinated, naïve hamsters were not protected from viral infection transmitted via aerosols from the infected, IN- and oral- vaccinated index hamsters. Yet, one of the conclusions from the paper is that IN- and oral- vaccinated index hamsters transmitted less aerosolized infectious virus to unvaccinated naïve hamsters. Have I misinterpreted the data from figures 4b-d? The results of the study make a strong case for adenoviral-vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate that induces mucosal immunity and I look forward to reading more studies from this team.",2021-10-25T04:06:16,criticaldissections,Critical Dissections,,,,

Collecting samples at multiple locations inside and outside of the park provided a large and diverse pool of data, thus supporting the validity of the investigation. The read count variability of airDNA inside the enclosures in comparison to outside seemed unexpected. Especially since there was so much drift between the closures, I expected there to be a similar amount of drift to outside the park as well. What might account for this difference? Wouldn’t the same weather and climate patterns that caused airDNA to drift between the enclosures also cause it to drift outside?

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.04.458989v1#comment-5581285647,biorxivstage,0,"This manuscript examines the role of steroid hormones in regulating exit from the dauer diapause state in C. elegans. The manuscript presents a careful examination of partial dauers made by daf-9 mutants that are deficient in dafachronic acid (DA) steroid hormone production, concluding that these partial dauers are dauers that have initiated but failed to complete dauer exit, and that thus, complete exit from dauer requires DA steroid hormones. These major conclusions of the paper are well-supported by the experimental evidence. Convincing experiments demonstrate that daf-9 mutants make full dauers in unfavorable conditions, that these animals then become partial dauers when shifted to favorable conditions, and that many daf-9 partial dauers formed in favorable conditions transit through a transient full dauer state on their way to becoming partial dauers. Finally, it is shown that DA steroid hormones promote exit of arrested daf-9 partial dauers. This is a solid study and my critiques are all relatively minor. Minor Points 1. The paper could be clearer on precisely how daf-9 and DA steroid hormones are required for dauer exit. Though it is true that daf-9 and DA are required for “complete” dauer exit as accurately stated in the Abstract, the take-home message of the paper often seems to be that daf-9 and DAs are required for “dauer exit” without getting into the nuance of which aspect of exit (e.g. lines 143-144 and elsewhere). The idea that DA hormones are required for exit is unintuitive and paradoxical given that daf-9 mutants actually initiate dauer exit rapidly under favorable conditions. Though the paper is generally careful in the precise way it talks about exit, I think it would be clearer to explicitly state the precise role of daf-9 and DA in dauer exit as follows. Based on the data in this paper, I would argue that there are two steps to dauer exit, only one of which depends on daf-9 and steroid hormones. First, an animal needs to initiate dauer exit, which leads it from the full dauer state to the partial dauer state. This step does not seem to require DA steroid hormones as daf-9 mutants initiate dauer exit from the full dauer state to the partial dauer state rapidly. Instead, this initial exit is likely regulated in a similar way as dauer entry – it is blocked by high levels of dauer pheromones, or in Daf-c mutants like daf-2 and daf-7. When pheromone is low (“favorable conditions”) initial exit occurs to the partial dauer state in a DA-independent fashion, and then there is a second stage of regulation going from partial dauers to non-dauers. daf-9 and DA steroid hormones are both necessary and sufficient for this second step, exiting from the partial dauer stage and resuming reproductive development. In one sense, it could be argued that daf-9 and DAs are required for full “execution” of dauer exit, not the “decision” to exit (just as daf-16 partial dauers are sometimes suggested to be defective in the execution of dauer formation rather than the decision). So ultimately, the action of DA hormones is required for reproductive development, whether it is to bypass dauer entirely at the L2 stage or whether it is to fully recover after forming dauers. 2. Some figures would benefit from non-dauer controls. For example, in Fig 2, it would be nice to see the pharynx width, speed, and pumping frequency of non-dauer L3s as a comparison. Without these controls, it isn’t clear which aspects of the daf-9 phenotype are dauer-like vs. non-dauer. Similarly, in Fig 3E, the daf-9 partial dauers have a speed similar to the recovered WT dauers. After 24 hours in favorable conditions, I would think the WT would be at L4 stage (i.e. fully non-dauer), yet this is one piece of evidence that daf-9 full dauers can become partial dauers upon a shift to favorable conditions. So does a partial dauer move at the same speed as an L4? If so, speed would not be a very useful measure in defining an animal as a partial dauer because it wouldn’t distinguish partial dauers and non-dauers. Including a WT L4 control would be useful. Pumping frequency in 3F is clearly less for daf-9 partial dauers than recovered WT dauers (presumed L4), but what about pharynx width shown in 3G? Is that more like a dauer or a non-dauer? Again, a WT L4 control would be useful. 3. Related to point 2 above, it would be nice to show that WT dauers at early stages of recovery (much less than 24 hours) resemble daf-9 partial dauers. That would demonstrate there is likely nothing abnormal or incomplete about daf-9 partial dauers and really nail the idea that the daf-9 partial dauer phenotype is due to defects in dauer exit rather than dauer formation. 4. Though strong evidence is presented that some daf-9 partial dauers transit through a transient dauer state (Fig. 4), it also seems likely based on the data in Figs 4 and S2 that daf-9 can also go from an L2d to a partial dauer without becoming a full dauer, though this possibility is not discussed. This raises several questions. Are the daf-9 partial dauers formed at 20° without going through a full dauer state (Fig S2) different than those formed at 25.5° (Fig 4)? If WT L2d are shifted to favorable growth conditions before becoming dauer, do they go through a partial dauer state that resembles daf-9 mutants? Do daf-9 L2d look the same as WT L2d? 5. Related to point 4 above, the presumed daf-9 mutant L2d pharynx shown in Fig 4B looks somewhat slim – a WT L2d pharynx photo would be useful as comparison. 6. It is stated twice (lines 130 and 157) that there is only “anecdotal evidence” that daf-9(dh6) and daf-12(rh273) mutants form full dauers under unfavorable conditions. However, the two papers cited (Antebi et al.1998; Gerisch et al. 2001) both have tables with quantitative data showing full dauers formed in these mutants under starvation conditions. I would suggest to not use the phrase “anecdotal evidence.” 7. Lines 348-350: it is suggested that DA does not promote exit of full daf-9 dauers in the presence of pheromone because of inaccessibility of DA. Though this is possible, another possibility is that DA only promotes dauer exit after an initial decision to exit that does not occur in the presence of pheromone (see point 1 above). 8. It appears that the WT and daf-9 full dauer speed data shown in Fig 2C may be the same data shown in Fig 3E. If so, this should be stated explicitly, and any other data reused between different figure panels should be stated. Were all the data in Fig 3E from experiments performed in parallel? If not, this should be stated. 9. It would be helpful to show DIC micrographs of the pharynx without the yellow outline drawn on top since it is very hard to see the pharynx boundaries with the drawn outline (Figs 2A, 3G, 4B, S3). I would recommend a supplementary figure showing the same images without the outline. 10. It is unclear which daf-9 mutant is shown in Fig 3G (presumably dh6 but not stated). Please state this in the legend. 11. It would be helpful to state in the Fig 6C legend that these are WT dauers, not daf-9 dauers. 12. I was confused by Fig 7D. It seems that the presence of the UAS::ICE transgene promotes dauer exit, regardless of the presence of the XXX cGAL driver, which seems odd. Then I read in the Methods that dauers with the UAS::ICE transgene are SDS-sensitive. Are these real full dauers or partial dauers? If they aren’t normal full dauers, it seems questionable using them in an assay on dauer exit. Perhaps the UAS::ICE integration site or a mutation in that background caused by integration affect the dauer state? Given these concerns, I would recommend cutting this experiment from the paper. The laser ablation experiment in Fig 7C is much cleaner. 13. In Fig S3, it is stated that the labeled neuron is actually due to bleedthrough of RFP in a coinjection marker. This coinjection marker should be listed in the genotype of this strain in Table S1. Also, it appears that there might also be some GFP in the posterior pharynx in this image. Any explanation?

I agree with the comments below, if you could further explain how you were able to connect that ROS lead to increased cell proliferation. I understand that due to the increased ERK-KTR translocation that this means theres an increase in proliferation but I am confused about how from your data (Figure 4D) how you are then concluding that ROS is the reason behind the increased proliferation. Overall, I think this paper has great clinical relevance and am wondering what future work you could see being done. I know you had mentioned that these macrophage mitochondria are not being degraded and am wondering if you have any indication as to why this is?

I have one comment about, perhaps, a critical assumption that may not be true. You cite reference 23, which is Cutiongco et al. 2019 ( https://doi.org/10.1038/s41..., and state: ""The assumption is that cells with more similar morphological features (e.g. cell size, nuclei size, granularity, or distribution) also have more similar transcriptional profiles23"" In Cutiongco et al., they tested 14 genes, and observed that they were associated with concomitant morphological changes as a result of different nanotopographies. I am not sure if this relationship will hold true for other genes and especially, outside of using nanotopography as an environmental stimulus. Also, evidence from other domains indicates that morphological differences may not necessarily indicate large gene expression differences (see Que et al. 2020: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41... where they found only 9 genes differentially expressed between neurons with different morphologies). I suppose my point is that the field needs more evidence of the linkage expectation between expression and morphology, and, to the extent that this assumption impacts normalization, I would be a bit weary of over-interpretation.",2021-10-22T17:33:40,gregoryway,Gregory Way,,,,

The main objective to investigate the composition, activation, and functionality of immune cells in the nasal mucosa was accomplished with sufficient supporting data. However, a lot of statistical data was represented in the figures with little or no information about how it was calculated, such as the Kruskal stress values and the multi-dimensional plots with Euclidian distances. The violin plots with box plots were the best way to represent the data in the paper and were easy to interpret. The correlation between the reduced number of nasal granulocytes and increased expression levels of CD66b, and increased MPO in children is profound. I wanted to know if it was challenging to collect nasal biopsies in so many individuals to measure monocyte functionality that you had to switch to blood. Could this comparison of immune cell functionality in mucosa samples vs. blood be made using mouse models? Do you think this study can be used for making personalized medicines against respiratory tract infections in children or older adults with underlying conditions?

Just two quick comments on figure 6 suppl 4 : 1) there is a microscopic reversibility issue in the kinetic scheme, which would be solved by increasing the AD --> ADI by 10^3 fold (i.e. k'on.10^3 rather than k'on) 2) by increasing 1000 fold the desensitization on-rate, it seems you are decreasing the lifetime of the open state rather than stabilizing the desensitized state (of course, there is a thermodynamic shift in favour of the desensitized state, but it doesn't sound to me like a stabilization in a kinetic sense). My bet is that if you rather decrease the desensitization recovery rate (d-), akin what you did for the flipped state in fig 6 suppl 3, you will end up with a similar observation to what we had for our 2018 review (GLIC & DHA): pretty much no effect on the peak current following preapplication of the inhibitor.

As I was reading the paper and the main point of Polypolish is to reduce errors in repetitive regions, I was almost sure that Merqury was going to be used to assess the error reduction. Have you heard about it before? I have not heard of ALE before, but by your description, it seems a mapping-based score, which would skew to non-repeats. I think Merqury might be a better fit because it is kmer-based, and thus it does not suffer from the mapping bias. Among other things, Merqury can provide a global QV score for your assembly, comparing the assembly kmer spectra to the short-reads kmer spectra. I suspect Merqury's QV scores can better reflect the reduction in repeat regions. Furthermore, I wonder what one can achieve if you use both metrics. Being ALE a good representative of non-repetitive error reduction and Merqury's QVs of the global error reduction, one might think that something like the ratio or the difference of both could directly correlate to error reduction in repetitive regions. Although one would have to think about how to normalize the metrics to make them comparable, I think it is still an idea worth exploring. I hope this comment helps and I wish you the best.

I feel like it is hard to draw comprehensive conclusions based on this experimental design. Even if under this condition, cell proliferation decreased, you can only conclude that ROS leads to increased cell proliferation, so transferred mitochondria can lead to cell proliferation through ROS accumulation, but you cannot eliminate the possibility that transferred mitochondria can induce cell proliferation through other mechanisms. I think another way to do it would be in cancer cells transferred or not transferred with mitochondria, either somehow knocking out all ROS or not knocking out all ROS, and comparing four experimental group’s proliferation state with each other. Then, we can know if transferred mitochondria induced proliferation is completely ROS dependent or not. I might be wrong, but I hope my comment makes sense!",2021-10-20T06:09:07,sebwang,Seb Wang,,,,

High density surface EMG is recorded from 6 lower limb muscles and motor unit (MU) decomposition is used to obtain MU spike trains. Functional connectivity (cross-correlation of smoothed discharge rates) is used to obtain connectivity matrices which were thresholded to defined motor neuron networks. These analysis show that motor units innervating different muscles are grouped together by receiving common synaptic input, thereby reducing the dimensionality of movement control. This substantially overlaps in rationale and methodology with our previous study in which we used graph theory to extract muscle networks based on common synaptic inputs (Boonstra et al, 2015). In that study, we used functional connectivity analysis (coherence of EMG envelopes) between 10 lower limb muscles to obtain connectivity matrices which were thresholded to defined muscle networks. In a subsequent study (Kerkman et al, 2018), we used modularity analysis to extract different clusters that receive common input, which is also used in the current paper by Hug et al (2021). We also argued that these analyses may help to advance our understanding of the modularity of movement control. In a conversation with the lead author, he acknowledged that the idea for this paper (Hug et al, 2021) comes from our previous work (among others), that the citations were accidentally removed and will added again in a next iteration.

First the  Destrieux atlas is not a functional atlas. People keep using these sorts of atlases in fMRI work and I have no idea why. The Superior temporal lobe is not a functional unit. That giant big mid-frontal region is not the DLPFC and not well overlapped with what may be reasonable activity patterns for tasks such as the NBack. Also, the analysis appears to use Beta values from various contrasts. IME the average t-value is more reliable as a metric because it is (de)weighted by the noise in the voxel/vertex/region. In any analysis of general patterns of activity, I have found more robust using individual t stats rather than betas. Also you included many contrasts, including several that have obviously lower ICCs, and in most of the paper appear to collapse across all regions and contrasts. For the Nback, I'd mainly focus on the 0 Bk, 2Bk, and most importantly, the commonly used 0vs2Bk contrast. Those look like they have relatively decent ICCs to me. Relatedly in the figures you average across all contrasts, but some of them are not very good contrasts and as a result, your reported regional ICCs are dragged down. Rather than a take all approach, I think it would be better to focus on the primary contrasts as the ones being used. I object to the use of ROI as regions which you found interesting when the entire analysis is based off an atlas; the more conventional use of ROI is parcels, etc, in the broader sense, rather than 'parcels I think are interesting versus those I think may be less interesting'. I'm being pedantic but it confused me. (everything after this is me pontificating on things I think are interesting in general). Interesting and important point that contrasts vs baseline have higher stability than two task contrasts, but I also think we forget this is a truism. If you have an imperfect measurement, and subtract another imperfect measurement from it, the reliability of the difference must, by definition, be lower than the reliability of the two separate things (of I see this is mentioned later in the discussion). Important that the SST and MID tasks had much poorer reliability. My opinion has between that reward tasks generally have very poor reliability, potentially because the signal is not strong enough, but also because people may vary quite a bit with themselves even how they respond to trials, and oscillate. One point of potential import is that a lot of these analyses being done across the field are assuming task activation should be stable, but the brain, and fMRI, is inherently dynamic. Averaging activity by model fit across these relativity short tasks may not provide a very stable metric. Considerations of dynamic processes may yield greater information, but a big challenge there is motion (its always motion...) which makes dynamic measures really hard.",2021-10-14T16:31:13,colinhawco,Colin Hawco,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.04.455110v1#comment-5569969364,biorxivstage,0,"There are several things about the data presented here, along with the author’s interpretations, that are concerning and warrant close scrutiny. 1.	From the Results section, it is unclear how many loci were retained for analysis. There was, evidently, more than one dataset that was generated because the authors refer to a “main dataset” in the Methods and to more than one dataset (with differing numbers of loci) in the Results. Also, at line 215, they state “3.935 samples remained from 55 individuals”. How can a fraction of a sample remain? Is a sample an individual animal? At line 219, they state that there is a dataset with as few as 7 SNPs. This is very concerning as any analysis on a RAD dataset consisting of 7 SNPs will likely not have any power to address their research questions. It is not stated which analyses are applied to which datasets; therefore, it is not possible for the reader to decide for themselves whether their results can be trusted. 2.	There are two oddities in the PCA that need to be explained. First, the PCA is not centered on zero. Additionally, it shows that 98% of the variation in the data set is explained by the first PC; however, there is no separation of individuals into clusters along the first axis. The authors ignore both of these incredibly odd patterns and focus on the 2nd axis to explain that some population structure is revealed by the second PC. I’ve never seen a PCA with these two odd patterns in the published literature, and I don’t know how to explain it (neither do the authors, evidently, since they made no attempt to interpret what is responsible for explaining 98% of the variation in their dataset), but it reveals a serious flaw in either the dataset or methods of analysis and should have been a warning flag to the authors. No other results from this study can be trusted until the oddities of the PCA can be explained in such a way that lends confidence to the quality of the dataset itself. 3.	Much of their conclusions are based on the results of STRUCTURE, but the STRUCTURE graph is not provided within the paper (nor is the supplemental documentation provided). The authors state that the best value for K is 3. If the pattern in the STRUCTURE graph does not show three clusters that correspond to geographically sampled locations, then this would need to be explained. It would be interesting to see what the STRUCTURE plot actually looks like given that the PCA is uninterpretable (the PCA and STRUCTURE plot should show comparable patterns). In the Discussion, the authors say that the inferred best value of K doesn’t match the STRUCTURE plot, stating at line 303 “However, examining the plots suggests that samples represent a single interbreeding population”. This discrepancy would need to be explained, and their explanation of more clusters, sampling scheme, and newly colonized subpopulations (lines 304-308) are very difficult to understand. 4.	The authors cite a study by Pfau et al. (which appears to be the most relevant study of this species) and compare their findings in the following passage. However, they misinterpret the findings of Pfau et al. and apparently do not understand the data upon which Pfau et al. drew their conclusions. The authors state at line 272 “More recently, [Pfau et al.] observed low mitochondrial DNA variation but high microsatellite diversity within the species. They concluded that genetic drift and not gene flow has had a greater impact on configuring D. elator genetic diversity. This result is possible because mitochondrial DNA has a lower effective population size than neutral nuclear markers such as RAD loci. Genetic drift could play a role in structuring mitochondrial DNA diversity, but more time would be needed to detect reduction of diversity in the nuclear genome using older markers such as microsatellites. An insufficient number of polymorphic microsatellite loci limits genetic resolution between individuals with supposed low population-level diversity. Our results suggest that RAD loci, that have a slower rate of mutation than microsatellites, are superior when investigating populations with weak population structure.” The first sentence is correct. However, the second sentence was only a portion of the conclusions of Pfau et al. and unrelated to mtDNA variation because that particular conclusion was based only on the microsatellite dataset. Pfau et al. actually concluded-- using microsatellite markers--that ""All methods addressing population structure indicated that the Iowa Park population was divergent from the others, with Vernon and Harrold showing a somewhat intermediate relationship but with a closer affiliation with Quanah than Iowa Park, despite their closer proximity to Iowa Park. This pattern did not conform to isolation by distance, thus genetic drift appears to have played a greater role than gene flow in establishing genetic structure."" Given the wording in the paragraph quoted above, the authors appear to be conflating the results from the mtDNA and microsatellite markers in Pfau et al. While it is true that mtDNA has a lower effective population size than nuclear marks such as RAD loci, Pfau et. al did not use RAD loci—they used microsatellites. It is also true that “Genetic drift could play a role in structuring mitochondrial DNA diversity, but more time would be needed to detect reduction of diversity in the nuclear genome”, but Pfau et al. provided explanations for why the mtDNA diversity was so low despite relatively high microsatellite diversity—going beyond just differences in effective population size. Furthermore, Pfau et al. found that nuclear microsatellites DID reveal population structure but that mtDNA did NOT reveal population structure (because there was essentially no mtDNA diversity which could be partitioned). The authors go on to say that “insufficient number of polymorphic microsatellite loci limits genetic resolution between individuals with supposed low population-level diversity”; however, microsatellite diversity was actually relatively high. The authors go on to state that RAD loci are superior to microsatellites. This is correct, but only because RAD datasets typically contain many more loci than microsatellite datasets. Surprisingly, the authors evidently didn’t notice that the microsatellite dataset of Pfau et al. actually revealed MORE genetic structure than their own RAD dataset (the opposite of what they predicted when comparing the two markers). 5.	The authors state “Our samples were collected on opposite sides of a cline, separated by a region of inaccessible private land, so it was difficult to determine if the slight differentiation is due to that distance or if there is true population substructure and isolation from other habitat patches” (line 315). A cline is found when there is a continuous distribution, but since they also state that it is unknown if populations exist between their sampling locations, how do they know that they’ve sampled opposite ends of cline, two genetically isolated populations, or two sides of a panmictic population? They attempted to use historical samples to fill in this distributional gap, but doing so ignores the likelihood that allele frequencies have changed within these populations over the sampled time frame. In addition, their predictions themselves are incorrect and difficult to interpret. They say “if the contemporary east and west subpopulations were indeed distinct” (line 320), which I interpret from the context to mean that the populations are geographically isolated rather than continuous. Given this hypothesis, they predict that the geographically intermediate population “the sampling hole” would be genetically intermediate between the two ends. This is actually the opposite of what is expected from population genetic theory which predicts that isolated populations diverge randomly with respect to one another. They predict the alternative hypothesis--that the species is one population--to reveal “greater differentiation between them and our sampling hole samples”. I do not understand what this statement is attempting to describe, but this hypothesis is the one that would predict the geographically intermediate population to be genetically intermediate—but only if gene flow is restricted sufficiently to produce isolation by distance. A panmictic population would show all three locations to be genetically homogenous. 6.	The authors appear to make an attempt to discuss their findings in the context of metapopulation theory (lines 349-358), but it’s confusing because of their attempted elaboration on what constitutes metapopulation criteria. They never actually make an connection between their genetic findings and metapopulation theory, but using other sources of information, state “this connection to metapopulation theory is still tenuous”. Yet they go on to state “Should managers elect for extreme measures to manage D. elator populations, such as translocations or reintroductions, knowledge that the population is a metapopulation is critical”. It seems especially careless to state that it is critical that managers recognize the species as a metapopulation when the connection is still tenuous. In conclusion, the striking oddities in the PCA demand a reanalysis on the quality of the dataset itself. If the dataset is in question, the results of all other analyses cannot be trusted. Furthermore, the many instances in which the authors misinterpreted their own results and made incorrect predictions from their hypotheses, are further indications that this study needs much attention before it can be used to understand the genetic patterns of Dipodomys elator for purposes of conservation and management.",2021-10-13T19:32:14,disqus_UiaQD0sAEk,Anon Anon,,,,

This has been quite convincingly demonstrated in the two reports listed below. Thus, the data presented cannot support a non-coding RNA function. They are more consistent with the idea that the mRNAs categorized in this work as ‘translated’ encode proteins that are FA constituents, whereas the mRNAs categorized as ‘untranslated’ simply encode proteins that do not associate with FAs and likely diffuse to other locations after translation. Enam SU et al. ‘Puromycin reactivity does not accurately localize translation at the subcellular level’. (2020) eLife doi: 10.7554/eLife.60303 Hobson BD et al. ‘Elongation inhibitors do not prevent the release of puromycylated nascent polypeptide chains from ribosomes’. (2020) eLife doi: 10.7554/eLife.60048 2) The experiments using RNAse A-treated cells are perplexing. The authors are apparently assuming that RNAse A is cell-permeable, but that should not be the case. Are they certain that they are not looking at an effect caused by degradation of some extracellular RNAs? Different controls would be needed than what is provided in Figure S4A (RNase A will obviously degrade RNAs after the cells are broken up, but that cannot be taken to mean that RNAse A which was just added in the media was taken up by living cells and degraded intracellular RNA). 3) Ribosome profiling is performed from FA preparations that are isolated in buffer of low ionic strength and without Magnesium. However, under these conditions, ribosomes are expected to dissociate. Therefore, it is not surprising that no translation is detected for most mRNAs. 4) The fact that proteins encoded by FA-associated mRNAs are not detected as proteins in FAs cannot be taken as evidence for lack of translation. It is equally likely that the translated proteins diffuse away and have roles other than being FA constituents.",2021-10-11T14:54:04,,A Scientist,,,,

Regarding the hypothesis of functional ANT at the epithelium cell membranes, these extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. In general, there are several technical and methodological points of concerns: Overexpression of ANT (mitochondrial ANT content is tightly regulated) can lead to miss-targeting, sorting or even excretion from cells, especially in cells with a high secretory capacity. It also has been shown that a significant portion of mitochondrial proteins are excreted through vesicles and Exosomes. Technically, there is the possibility of imaging immuno-histo/cyto-chemistry artifacts due to unspecific binding of primary and secondary antibodies (entrapment), when  employing fluorescence-immunocytochemistry in this notoriously difficult cell type. It would have been nice to have additional evidence for ANT localization to the cell membranes, either by immunohisto/cyto staining controls, a secondary detection method (higher mag or EM) or simple biophysical cellular fractionation (lipid fraction) and protein detection (western).

In Figure 3 the PCA implies there are samples 3, 4 and 5 within each strain, but there is no explanation of this in the methods, legend or results text.  I can't work out how t-tests for significance for 3h vs 4h or 3h vs 5h in Table 1 could be calculated if there is no replication to provide a measure of biological variation within the experiment.  Please could the authors clarify what biological replication was used, if any?",2021-10-05T16:41:18,drannebishop,Dr Anne Bishop,,,,

I would encourage the authors to look into activation and response of memory T and B cells to APCs primed with  antigens against different variants. Memory cells will remain long after the antibodies are cleared out of our bodies.,2021-10-04T23:54:47,esperanzabas,"Esperanza Bas, PhD",,,,
