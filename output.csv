I like the approach of performing repellency tests with a higher throughput assay but having an exit hands-on-cage (real-world) assay. A few relevant issues occurred to me, which the authors may want to consider: 1) It might be more appropriate to report repellency in terms of protection (per EPA & WHO guidelines). Also, it seems that 75% repellency is too low. A good repellent should provide approximately 100% protection for a couple of hours. 2) As you know, the core principle of scientific publication is to provide enough information that a qualified person can perform the work. Several qualified researchers could test whether the newly discovered repellents are indeed more effective than DEET. However, the names of the new repellents, their sources, and chemical characterization (if newly synthesized) were not disclosed. {Is there a SI file I missed?] 3) Suppose there is an issue of intellectual property. In that case, this issue should be addressed first, and then the work should be considered for publication with a complete list of compounds tested, particularly those claimed to be more effective than DEET. Other minor issues for your consideration: 1) In the introduction, the sentence referring to the discovery of picaridin needs to be re-phrased. Picaridin was developed before insect ORs were discovered, let alone the co-receptor Orco. 2) Insect ORs are not G-protein coupled receptors, as implied in the introduction. Thank you for sharing a preprint in BioRxiv. It is a remarkable development.

Re: On the therapeutic potential of MAPK4 in triple-negative breast cancer Feng Yang Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas * Corresponding Author: Feng Yang, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX, 77030. Phone: 713-798-8022; Fax: 713-790-1275; E-mail: fyang@bcm.edu Boudghene-Stambouli et al. recently published “On the therapeutic potential of MAPK4 in triple-negative breast cancer” in BioRxiv concerning our Nature Communications publication, “MAPK4 promotes triple negative breast cancer growth and reduces tumor sensitivity to PI3K blockade.”, published 11 January 2022 (1). We want to reply to their comments as follows. Boudghene-Stambouli et al. essentially detected a similar MAPK4 protein expression pattern (Our report (1) vs. Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Fig. 1c) in the human TNBC cells, when using the same commercially available antibody AP7298b. However, they claimed, “We failed to detect a specific ERK4 band in any of the cell lines, including Hs578T cells transfected with human ERK4 cDNA.” They then used their own “validated custom polyclonal ERK4 antibody that we use routinely in our laboratories” to produce a different MAPK4 expression pattern (Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Fig. 1c). They provided a siRNA knockdown for the “validation” of their antibody. In this case, Boudghene-Stambouli et al. largely ignored our previous publications using the commercially available AP7298b to successfully confirm the overexpression, knockdown (up to five independent shRNAs), and knockout of MAPK4 in many human cancer cell lines and in “normal” cells (1-4). AP7298b can also detect a purified GST-MAPK4 fusion protein in the GST pulldown assays and the purified Flag/His-tagged wild-type and mutated MAPK4 proteins in the in vitro kinase assays (2). It should be noted that instead of our extensive validation of AP7298b using many MAPK4-overexpressing, knockdown (up to five independent shRNAs), and knockout cells as well as purified MAPK4 proteins (overexpressed/purified from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells), Boudghene-Stambouli et al. only used a single siRNA to “validate” their un-named custom antibody. Besides, they did not confirm HA-MAPK4/Erk4 overexpression in their Hs578T cells (Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Fig. 1c). Please note, due to the sensitivity of different antibodies, even if an HA-positive western blot is provided, it may not confirm significantly increased ectopically overexpressed MAPK4 expression over the endogenous MAPK4. Finally, their custom antibody detected many non-specific bands compared to AP7298b (Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Suppl. Fig. 1c, which was included in their submission recently rejected by [Journal name redacted to follow bioRxiv's policy] after peer-review). Therefore, we have concerns over Boudghene-Stambouli et al.’s concern on MAPK4 protein expression levels in the MAPK4-high TNBC cell lines that we used in our study (1). It is well-known that mRNA and protein abundances may not correlate well in biological systems. Therefore, Boudghene-Stambouli et al.’s concern about the variation of MAPK4 mRNA expression across the cell lines will not carry that much weight. We also noticed that Boudghene-Stambouli et al. used our reported 5’ primer but a modified 3’ primer for their qPCR data in Fig. 1a. We wonder whether they have performed qPCR using our reported 5’ and 3’ primers to detect MAPK4 expression (3), and what were the results? Besides, although we have not systematically examined MAPK4 mRNA expression in human TNBC cell lines as we did for human prostate cancer cell lines (3), we did qPCR confirmed MAPK4 expression in MDA-MB-231, SUM159, as well as the non-small cell lung cancer H1299 cells. Besides, Zheng et al. independently showed MAPK4 mRNA and protein expression in HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231 cells (5), two of the TNBC cell lines concerned by Boudghene-Stambouli et al. Without knowing the quality of Boudghene-Stambouli et al.’s RNA-seq data, we could not comment on their Fig. 1b data. Another concern of Boudghene-Stambouli et al. is their failure to verify our reported MAPK4-AKT signaling axis, a conclusion drawn from their Fig. 2 data. Without providing their data, the corresponding author Dr. Meloche has communicated with me about this issue. At that time, I provided the following answer. “I am not sure if you did a transient transfection in the 293 cells. Unlike MK5, phosphorylation of AKT is subjected to many more direct and indirect regulations in the cells. It is hard to imagine that you can easily detect MAPK4 phosphorylation of cell endogenous AKT in the transiently transfected 293 cells. It can be a hit and miss, especially if you do not carefully monitor cell confluency. I think that we only reported data from the stable 293T cells overexpressing MAPK4 or MAPK4 phosphorylating a co-transfected AKT in 293T cells. In the latter case, we suspect that these ectopically overexpressed AKT are less susceptible to endogenous cellular posttranslational modifications and more susceptible to the regulation of overexpressed MAPK4. Again, unless you can’t repeat our data, such as MAPK4 phosphorylating a co-transfected AKT in 293T cells, I do not see a common ground for our debate here either.” Now I see the experimental data, and Boudghene-Stambouli et al. did perform a transient transfection and tried to detect phosphorylation change of endogenous AKT, which we have already expressed concern about in our previous personal communications. Interestingly, as a positive control for their Fig. 2 data, Boudghene-Stambouli et al. showed MAPK4 enhanced the phosphorylation of an ectopically overexpressed but not endogenous MK5, raising concern about this so-called positive control per se. We are also unsure how much MAPK4 was overexpressed compared to endogenous MAPK4 (Western blots on GFP could not provide that information) nor the nature of the seemingly increased AKT T308 phosphorylation in the MAPK4 transfected 293 cells (Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Fig. 2). I want to finish this discussion using what I wrote to Dr. Meloche in another email. “Without detailed information from your side, it is hard for me to guess what happened. I want to emphasize several technical details that may help. 1. Please collect cells at about 50%-70% confluency. If your lab collected cells at very high confluency, please try this. 2. We have been using Dox-inducible knockdown and overexpression approaches. We typically maintain the cell culture without Dox induction and do a couple of days (such as three days) induction just before the experiments. 3. If you use a non-induction system as we did in some of our studies, please ensure that you only use the engineered cell lines at early passages. You can do this by freezing down many vials from a very early passage and only using the thawed-out cells for minimal additional passage(s). The cancer cells in culture may adapt to the cellular “stress” from long-term MAPK4 overexpression or knockdown.” We welcome open discussions based on solid experimental data. We will do our best to help if any group meets technical difficulty in repeating our data under the reported experimental conditions. We have validated our MAPK4-AKT signaling in more than 20 human cancer cell lines (Ref. (1-3), and unpublished data), and additional independent reports also confirmed MAPK4 phosphorylates/activates AKT in human cancer cells (5, 6). We welcome and are looking forward to more independent studies in this area. References 1. Wang W, et al.

I really love the inventiveness of the experimental set up! The results are really unexpected. The finding that phosphate starvation proceeds ABA mediated drought responses is interesting on a mechanistic basis and will likely have direct implications for crop management practices. The field-to-lab experimental pipeline looks really effective and I look forward to more people taking up this approach. I do have a couple of points that I believe the authors could discuss in more depth. In their ridge trials, the geometry of the soil may play a role. Phosphate starvation induces a lot of lateral roots close to the soil surface, to maximise phosphate capture. In the ridge set-up, lateral roots are restricted to only a single plane. Is it possible that this contributes to the PSR in ridge-grown plants? It is also possible that increased rooting depth under mild-drought treatment also reduces phosphate uptake. If the authors see a reduction in PSR gene expression after re-watering ridge plants, this may help to rule out geometric explanations. It should be noted that the pot experiments do already indicate this to some extent. I am also not so sure about the authors’ conclusion on why PSR is induced at mild drought but suppressed under severe drought “Under severe drought conditions, given the circumstantial evidence, our observations would support the notion that PSR induction is suppressed by a relative increase in Pi concentration due to a decrease in leaf water content (Fig. 4).” I would argue an alternative, more straight forward hypothesis, that plants simply prioritise drought stress over this level of phosphate starvation when drought is severe. Would the authors expect to see a recovery of the PSR if Pi levels dropped even lower? Once again, thanks to the authors for their very through-provoking study!

The comments were synthesized by Ehssan Moglad. The study conducted by Doyle et al. aimed to test the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) transfer activity of the human ORP5 protein via orthogonal targeting of different sites of membrane contact, namely, between the plasma membrane (PM) and the mitochondrial outer membrane. Major comments Figure 1: The idea behind the experiment is great, however, there are some questions about the data presented: - Recommend using better representative images, the morphology of the cells in panels B and C appears distorted, are these cells undergoing some death? This would make interpretation of the data difficult. - In Figure 1B, the control experiment should be done with a known mitochondrial marker to test if the construct works as expected. - P14P measurement using the P4M probe is unclear from the images and quantification provided. Please provide a multi-plane image of the probe showing its distribution on the PM and at the ER-PM or ER-mito contact site. - Please provide an additional graph to show the relative change of PI4P at the PM compared to the rest of the cell or respective contact site. - For a better comparison, recommend showing the normal (control) distribution of PI4P in the images. Results: ‘ As expected, we did not see the accumulation of PI4P at these contact sites (see graph in Fig. 1C), presumably due to SAC1 activity in the ER. Instead, the fluorescence of PM PI4P seemed to decline ’: Please indicate whether this result is statistically significant. Figure 2: The experiment with the FKBP-PI4KC1001 construct is not discussed in the text. Also, further clarification would be helpful for the results presented in panel B. In +SAC1mito, it is showing accumulation after Rapa treatment, please discuss why PI4P is not showing accumulation. 'The rationale was that without inhibition of PI4P synthesis, observing reductions in PM PI4P catalyzed by transport of PI4P out of the PM would require a rate that exceeded synthesis, which may not be possible through reduced flux at the much smaller surface area of induced PM-mitochondria contact sites, compared to ER-PM contact sites (compare Figs. 1C and D). We also imaged by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) to more sensitively detect changes in PM PI4P with the high-affinity PI4P biosensor, P4Mx2.': Recommend revising the fragment for clarity. Figure 3: The shape of the cells across figure 3 varies substantially, can some text be added to discuss why this is the case? Figure 3: The authors have already shown in a previous paper that SAC1 predominantly acts only in the 'cis' configuration. However, induced coupling of overexpressed ORP between ER-PM and mito-PM using rapamycin might bring these membranes closer than usual or cause the formation of more membrane contact sites. Thus, there may be some possibility for SAC1 to act in 'trans'. Alternatively, there could be indirect changes in PM PI4P due to increased activity of endogenous ORP5 at these induced contact sites. To address this: - Would it be possible to confirm if there was an increase in the number/size of contact sites by checking for mapper expression and localization when ORP5 constructs are expressed and coupled with Rapamycin? Lipid binding mutants of ORP5 could also be used to show that those lipid binding mutants do not cause a depletion upon coupling with Rapamycin. - For experiments where SAC1 (Fig 3) was overexpressed along with FRB::FKBP-ORP5-ΔTMD, please show control conditions where the SAC1 alone was expressed without the ORP5. Also, in a control condition where lipid binding mutants of ORP5 are expressed along with SAC1, there should be minimal effects on PM PI4P depletion compared to WT ORP5. Adding these controls will further confirm prior observations and substantiate the effects of FRB:: FKBP-ORP5-ΔTMD expression, and rule out any potential artifacts from overexpression of just SAC1. A major confound across all the experiments is the activity of endogenous ORP5 that is not measured. Is it possible to perform experiments (such as in Figure 3) where the endogenous ORP5 is downregulated using siRNA or shRNA and a siRNA/shRNA-resistant version of ORP5 is overexpressed in this background? There could be potential compensatory effects from other ORP5, and this would require simultaneous knockdown of multiple ORPs. Minor comments Figure 1: It could be helpful to start Figure 1 using a scheme of the two hypotheses on how ORP5 regulates PI4P levels at the plasma membrane. This will help easily assess the data presented in the Figures for and against the hypotheses. Figure 1A: It is difficult to see the co-localization in the current color scheme. It would be helpful to use a different color combination, provide zoomed-in images, or use pointers to highlight. Figures 1C and D: Please specify in the legend the timepoint when rapamycin was added and the subcellular membrane the measurements were made from. In discussion: 'In principle, this observation does not demonstrate lipid transfer (though it is compatible with it). Although tethering at a site of membrane contact seems to facilitate access of PI4P to SAC1, ORP5 could simply be presenting the lipid to the phosphatase, as opposed to depositing PI4P into the membrane for subsequent hydrolysis by SAC1. If ORP5 works in such a presentation mode, it is not clear to which membrane the resulting PI lipid is released: either back into the PM, or into the tethered membrane. In other words, lipid transfer is not necessarily part of the reaction '. Are there ways in which this can be tested? Suggest proposing some future experiments in the text.",2022-08-31T13:08:23,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2022.08.04.502856,Depletion of Plasma Membrane PI4P by ORP5 Requires Hydrolysis by SAC1 in Acceptor Membranes,"Colleen P.

Indeed, since our method is based on the number of reads at each location along the genome, sequencing-induced anomalies would in fact lead to spurious results if the method was used on unprocessed data. We have described our approach to reducing these effects in detail within the supplemental methods (Section IIIC, in particular subsections 2, 3, 4, and 10). In short, the analysis only uses loci that can be properly mapped. We first bin the reads into 1 kb regions, calculate the deviation of the reads from a 200 kb centered median, and then exclude the 10% most extreme 1 kb regions. We have found that this removes most (if not all) of the regions that have spurious local maxima/minima caused by the technical factors you've mentioned. In addition, for organisms in which there are known regions of poor compatibility with sequencing (Vibrio cholerae in particular), we have removed those anomalous regions by hand. We also use the standard method of dividing the exponential phase data by stationary phase data, since the sequencing-induced features are typically present in both cases. To further reduce the effects of noise, we have used the Akaike Information Criterion to select the ideal coarse-grained genomic resolution, thus optimizing the amount of signal we can obtain while minimizing the ability of noise and outliers to influence results. I hope that answers your question! Thank you so much for your interest in our pre-print!

The authors used distant Vespertilionids to place this root (instead, they could have used Kerivoulinae or Muriniae representatives, i.e. the sister-group of Myotinae, which would have been more effective in placing this root of Myotis). Also because they used only few Old World species, they gave little chance for that group to represent its full diversity.

Review synthesized by Bianca Melo Trovò. This study demonstrates the utility of an L-Methionine analog - ProSeMet - to tag and enrich proteins which have residues that are methylated in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that this can be used in combination with mass spectrometry to identify these sites. Overall this is a useful, well-verified and well-described approach that will be helpful for future identification and investigation of methylation sites. Major comments It would be helpful if the manuscript could additionally discuss the reversibility of methylation generally, and the reversibility of the modification of protein residues by the alkyne group specifically, in the discussion, and whether that has any implications for their results. It may be that the dynamics of methylation and demethylation vary between the two; or it may be that they are the same - either way, that may affect how they suggest others use this method and interpret its results. Perhaps related to the question of reversibility, it would be helpful if the manuscript would comment on whether these are “true” methylation sites or not; i.e. whether they consider all these methylation sites to be functional. Trying to determine this would be an interesting direction for future work, but for this study a reflection on whether these novel functional methylation sites are simply capable of being methylated, or are likely to be methylation sites that are meaningful biologically, would be helpful. Results, ProSeMet competes with L-Met to pseudo methylate protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus: the manuscript claims that ProSeMet is not incorporated into newly synthesized proteins but rather converted to ProSeAM and used by native methyltransferases. There does appear to be some reduction in the labeling with ProSeMet on cycloheximide treatment  in Figure 2D - could this suggest that it is incorporated into newly synthesized proteins as well as being converted to ProSeAM? If not, could the manuscript explain why not? This experiment clearly shows that in contrast to AHA labeling, there is still use of ProSeMet as a substrate when translation is inhibited; however, it is not clear how this demonstrates that it is not incorporated at all into newly synthesized proteins. If methyl has been incorporated in previously present proteins, perhaps this can be clarified in the text. Results, ProSeMet competes with L-Met to pseudomethylate protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus: the conclusion that “ Cell fractionation of the cytosolic and nuclear compartments followed by SDS-PAGE fluorescent analysis revealed no fluorescent labeling of the L-Met control ” is correct but may be overstated as there appears to be some background in the cytosolic fraction.

Comments on reporting Results, ProSeMet competes with L-Met to pseudo methylate protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus: Please verify the quantity reported: 5µg on SDS-PAGE gel seems low. Results, ProSeMet-directed pseudo methylation is detectable in vivo: the manuscript reports that “mice starved prior to ProSeMet injection had increased ProSeMet labeling in the heart, whereas mice fed prior to ProSeMet administration had increased labeling in the brain and lungs”.

The comments were synthesized by Vasanthanarayan Murugesan. In this preprint, Hughes et al. describe the interaction between the ER protein PERK and the mitochondrial protein ATAD3A. During ER stress, PERK phosphorylates elF2a leading to reduced global protein synthesis. The authors show that increased interaction between PERK and ATAD3A during such stress attenuates elF2a phosphorylation locally around mitochondria, resulting in continued translation of mitochondrial protein despite a reduction in global protein translation. The authors present multiple lines of evidence to support this claim and the experiments were well performed. The findings may have important implications for the understanding of mitochondrial protein synthesis and the interactions between mitochondria and the ER. The following suggestions were raised: Experiments The manuscript would benefit greatly by measuring protein translation explicitly showing that mitochondrial protein translation is retained despite a reduction in global protein synthesis under certain conditions. That would help determine whether mitochondrial protein translation is protected under certain conditions driven by ATAD3 expression. The specificity of ATAD3A towards PERK activation requires further experimental validation. Some specific suggestions are: - Changes in activation of other pEIF2a kinases, such as GCN2 or PKR, could be measured to discard their involvement. - In Figure S2, protein levels of ATF6 should accompany changes in spliced XBP1. - ATF4 levels, a downstream marker of the signaling pathway, could be measured. Manuscript Recommend providing more details about the experimental protocol when treating cells with ER stressors. Different treatment durations are found throughout the manuscript (30min, 1h, 8h…). More information would be helpful in understanding the election of those time points for different experiments. In Figure 2, recommend including the blots for the downstream targets ATF4, GADD34 and CHOP at the 30 minutes time point, where the upstream activation starts. In Figure 2, the differences shown in the representative images for p-eIF2a and ATF4 appear milder than what is shown in the graph. In particular when compared with the interpretation of blots in Fig. S2. It is suggested to include all the blots used for quantification in Figure 2 in a supplemental figure so it can be clear how overexpressing/downregulating ATAD3A has a meaningful effect on this signaling pathway. Figure 2B shows 5 different (phospho)proteins using the same loading control blot. This approach would require stripping of the membrane after each blotting, can this be specified in figure legends and in the Materials & Methods. Was the membrane stripped after each blot or were different membranes used? If different membranes were used, please indicate so and present the individual beta-actin blots corresponding to each protein as a supplemental figure. In Figure 3A, arrows indicating the contact sites between ER and the mitochondria would be helpful in highlighting the colocalization of the two proteins. Please also provide scale bars for the images. In Figure 3D, the #contacts per mitochondria, it is important to specify the area of images analyzed. It is unclear that n=45 images from 3 separate experiments refers to 45 images per experiment or a total of 45 images pooled from 3 experiments. Please clarify.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.11.503542v1#comment-5960826580,biorxivstage,0,"We were extremely interested to see these impressive structures of a chimeric Sec translocon, held in a state ready for post-translational translocation through interaction with Sec62/63, bound to eight different inhibitors. Particularly noteworthy to us is that the inhibitor mycolactone binds in a different location in this study when compared with our previous structure of the same inhibitor bound to a ribosome-bound translocon, primed for co-translational translocation (Gerard et al Molecular Cell 79 406-15). The authors speculate that “Our data suggest that the density feature previously assigned as mycolactone is unlikely to be mycolactone.” While it is true that our previous structure has a resolution of ~5A in the region of the map attributed to mycolactone, and therefore also true that we cannot unambiguously place mycolactone in this density, we remain confident that this density is mycolactone for the following reasons: (i)	Our procedure involved incubation of microsomes with mycolactone at a concentration of ~0.3µM (compared with 100µM used by Itskanov) before detergent/digitonin treatment and purification of ribosome-associated Sec complexes. A similar sample was prepared without mycolactone. When these two protein complexes were studied by cryo-electron microscopy, the Sec translocon adopted a substantially different conformation when mycolactone-bound compared with free. The only difference between these two samples was the presence of mycolactone, indicating that this structural difference is due to mycolactone binding. (ii)	We confirmed the presence of mycolactone in our mycolactone-bound purified using mass spectrometry of a sample taken immediately before addition to grids for structural analysis. (iii)	Analysis of the electron density for the mycolactone-bound translocon did not reveal any density feature in the mycolactone-bound sample in the location of the binding site observed by Itskanov. Therefore ribosome-bound, mycolactone-bound translocon is different from Sec62/63-bound, mycolactone-bound translocon. (iv)	The only additional density feature observed in the ribosome-bound, mycolactone-bound translocon is that which we have attributed to mycolactone and molecular dynamics simulations confirm that mycolactone is stable in this binding site. It is therefore our view that we did not misattribute the electron density into which we have placed mycolactone. Instead, it is our view that the difference between these two structures is likely to be genuine and mechanistically interesting. There are possible technical differences which could account for the different binding sites observed when comparing our structure with that of Itskanov: •	While we added mycolactone to the Sec translocon while still in the native membrane environment of microsomes, and then extracted the mycolactone-bound complex, Itskanov added to mycolactone to translocon after its purification and integration into  a non-lipid peptidisc. Our model for how mycolactone reaches its binding site in our system relies on translocon “breathing” within the physiological situation of a lipid bilayer, and mycolactone itself being present in this bilayer. It is not known if the translocon within a peptidisc is able to undertake similar “breathing”, nor how highly hydrophobic mycolactone may interact with this material. •	While we used native canine microsomes, Itzkanov et al used a hybrid translocon, comprised of human transmembrane regions and yeast extracellular regions. It is not known if this hybrid translocon is functional for translocation, or whether the translocation of model substrates by it is inhibited by mycolactone. •	There is also a large difference in mycolactone concentration used in the different studies. Mycolactone is effective at sub-nM concentrations on live cells. To provide sufficient molar ratios of mycolactone in concentrated microsomes, we used ~300nM in our studies, while Itskanov used the much higher concentration of 100µM mycolactone. It would be interesting to know whether this was the minimal concentration required for them to see binding, indicating a lower affinity binding site, or was simply the concentration selected. While there are technical differences which might account for the different binding sites observed, there is also the far more interesting possibility that both studies have correctly identified binding sites for mycolactone and that this inhibitor acts differently in post-translational and co-translational translocation. The Sec translocon can act through either a post-translational (involving Sec62/63) or a co-translational (involving ribosomes) mechanism. McKenna, Simmonds and High have previously shown (PMID 26869228) that mycolactone-mediated blockade is different in these two systems. While mycolactone shows a broad effect, preventing co-translational translocation of a wide range of substrates, it has a more restricted effect during post-translational translocation, only affecting translocation of a subset of substrates. Together with the differences in mycolactone binding between these two structures, this suggests the intriguing possibility mycolactone might have two different binding sites; perhaps one site which occurs during co-translational translocation where mycolactone is stably wedged into the cytosolic side of the lateral gate (Gerard et al), and one site which operates in post-translational translocation and is more easily overcome by signal peptide binding (Itskanov et al). Future studies will be required to test this intriguing possibility.

Such a value is almost certainly too low for a large nonavian theropod, being in the area of some of the lowest density flying birds and derived pterosaurs as detailed and/or estimated in Larramendi et al. (2021, Paul 2022). Having less extensive air-sac complexes, including reduced forelimbs, images of swimming large ratites indicate their neutral (midbreath) SGs approach 0.95. Lacking pneumatic limb elements, large theropod dinosaurs should have been even denser. Spinosaurus was less pneumatic than most giant theropods, but more so than typical large land mammals which have NSGs just below 1.0 – most swimming nonaquatic mammals keep their heads sufficiently above water partly by the upwards thrust of active swimming and are at risk of drowning if they become too tired. Estimating the NSG of atypical Spinosaurus is difficult, but it would have been significantly higher than that of ratites and perhaps a little below that typical of terrestrial mammals. Highly aquatic animals that use fairly conventional tetrapod limbs and/or sculling tails for swimming tend to be as dense as or denser than water, with some able to bottom walk including capybaras and hippos, the latter being too dense to surface swim and thus sporting a specific gravity of perhaps 1.1 (Larramendi et al. 2021). Highly aquatic crocodilians are in the area of 1.0. Flightless marine penguins are moderately pneumatic and buoyant. After using their highly hydrodynamically modified and powerful flippers to propel themselves to sometimes considerable depths, the buoyancy helps penguins return to the surface at a pace that minimizes both risk of the bends and energy expenditures when oxygen reserves are depleted (Sato et al. 2002). Those extreme circumstances do not apply to Spinosaurus. and its being pneumatic enough to be a little less dense than water also does not fit the standard adaptations for flipperless tetrapods that pursue prey underwater in shallows as crocodilians sometimes do. Nor does the large rigid, high drag sail. And the deep tail with its very tail slender neural spines assigned to the taxon is more similar to the display structures of nonaquatic basilisks than large bodied tail scullers (Sereno et al.). This paleoartist remains skeptical of Spinosaurus restorations with very reduced hindlimbs, that not yet being verified by any sufficiently complete, well-articulated spinosaur specimens that meet the paleoreconstruction criteria needed to verify a configuration that is so extraordinary for a theropod dinosaur.

I enjoyed reading it and I have a couple of questions/points of feedback that I would like to share. 1. Do I understand correctly that in lines 133-134 the authors state that higher percentages of read recruitment to donor MAGs suggest bacterial colonisation? This seems to me very indirect evidence and not a justifiable conclusion based on this observation alone. 2. In figure 1, Canada is shown slightly bigger than the other countries. Is this because the donors and patients from the current study are also from Canada? I could not find this information in the text. Furthermore, I like that the authors made a distinction between industrialised and less industrialised countries. Would it be possible to change the colours slightly (e.g. make the red magenta) to make it easier for colour blind people to see? Also, the blue and purple rows are somewhat difficult to distinguish for me. Is this intentional, as the donor and post-FMT recipient microbiota are supposed to be similar? 3. I find it interesting that the authors found that only 16 and 44% of donor microbial genomes were detected in all donor metagenomes, suggesting that only a minority of bacteria is stably present over longer periods. (Lines 180-182.) Have the authors considered doing similar analyses on these genomes to find if they are HMI and LMI bacteria? 4. I find the comparison made between short-read taxonomy and donor population detection (lines 184-188) a little difficult to follow. Would it be possible to rephrase this part or add a little explanation of what exactly is compared? 5. Lines 190-194 are also fascinating! Even with such small numbers, it is striking to see that more bacteria colonise from pills that from colonoscopic transfer. Could the authors speculate or provide additional info on why this may be the case? 6. From the final conclusion (lines 431-435) I gather that FMT or similar microbiota therapeutics are unlikely to (temporarily?) cure IBD. Do the authors have suggestions as to what might work better, and would they like to share their perspectives on promising new treatment options? 7. And finally, what do the ellipses in supplementary figures 2 and 3 represent? I suppose they show some sort of area around each cluster centroid. A few extra words of explanation in the figure captions would be nice. This information is also not easily found in the analysis scripts.

Accumulation of changes of several important amino acid residues causes those of ligand-binding specificity of odorant receptor. However, on the basis of your study, it might not be true.

There are three primary interrelated contributions: -Assigning “responsibility” for different regions of the map to a model and then fitting GMM as a real space B-factor. This is a new way to model atomic B-factors, since it is done in real space, compared to reciprocal space in most other software. -Sampling an ensemble based on those B-factors. The major success of this paper was that the authors created a new ensemble method that samples within the B-factors to improve the fit of hundreds of cyro-EM maps, demonstrating that their method is robust and can be done in a high throughput manner. -Refinement procedures for composite maps based on smoothing of responsibility. The examples all seem to be from individual maps with different levels of resolution across the map, not from true composite maps (calculated from different masking procedures for example). This part was very confusing for us to follow and although there are methodological links to the B-factor assignment/ensemble modeling parts of the paper, it might be better explained in a separate manuscript. Major comments: 1. The introduction only briefly discusses B-factors and doesn’t lay out what is distinct about this method. For a contrast, sampling is discussed with references and contrast: “ The sampling itself is usually based on either molecular dynamics (MD)4,9, minimisation10, normal mode analysis and/or gradient following techniques11,12, or Fourier-space based methods2.” Similarly, B-factor refinement should be discussed. The way Phenix and Refmac handle it (real vs. reciprocal space), the limitations that the GMM addresses, etc. 2. With regard to sampling, there are other methods that are now similar for generating ensembles (the EMMI work from Vendruscolo and Bonomi for example). It would be useful to contrast the limitations of those methods and how this method is distinct. For example, this method seems likely to be much more computationally simple to run. It would also be good to benchmark against examples of those ensemble methods in terms of RMSF/inferred B-factors. 3. When you refer to the TEMPy-REFF models in each case study are they always ensemble models using segmentation? 4. How are the weights for each focus map decided for when creating a composite map? Stated in ‘combining focused maps into a single overall composite map, with optimal weights of the focused maps.’ (page 3) We think that more information on how you are generating ensembles belongs in the results section which will help clarify the paper. Some additional specifics we think would make this section strong include: Are the ensembles being created for different segments of the model (based on map segmentation) or the entire model? When creating an ensemble, what is the input model? Has it already gone through iterations of the map to model fitting? How are ensemble models represented? Please provide examples and discuss how you would like these models interpreted. 5. Please clarify how b-factors are represented in your ensemble models and input into maps. Furthermore, in the discussion you state ‘We address this challenge using B-factor estimation. We find, as previously shown by us and others, that an ensemble of equally-well fitted models represents this local variability better than a single model.’ (page 16). However, it is unclear how the b-factors integrate with the ensemble model to represent local resolution. Please clarify which part of your model correlates with local resolution. 6. On average, how many models were included in an ensemble? Please provide a graph of CCC values versus number of models in an ensemble for more examples (ie more than SI Figure 7). How are you thinking about the trade-off between a more complex model versus a small gain in CCC? How deterministic is this procedure? Can you repeat and compare at least one dataset? If you generate multiple ensembles starting from the same structure - do you get the same number of models out and are they similar? 7. If we understand the calculations correctly, the increase in CCC comes from those models being refined independently, not collectively (which makes the increase all the more impressive). Does this suggest the ensemble captures both precision and accuracy (as discussed here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... and therefore the sampling allows escaping of local minima in a clever way. Are there other examples like the His alternative conformation that can help speak to this? 8. When assigning responsibility for a part of the map that may be able to similarly explain two parts of the model, how does the method decide which part of the model should fit in that segment of the map? Please provide more insight on the interpretation of uncertainty of discrete positions of different sidechains as described in the sentence ‘ensemble adopting either (bottom inset), or uncertainty in the exact side chain confirmation (bottom inset) of two residues (Y76 and L78)’. How is uncertainty measured? Is the RMSF similar or comparable to what would be inferred by B-factors? Please compare the numbers you are reporting to other traditional refinement softwares such as REFMAC and Phenix. It’s unclear whether this is capturing anharmonic motions in a really different way or just sampling the B-factor harmonic component. Minor comments: 1. In Figure 1a, please provide more description about what you are representing with the blue and orange circles in the responsibility estimation. 2. How does your method represent very high resolution structures with low b-factors but high numbers of alternative conformers (specifically looking at PDBs: 7A4M, 7A5V of Apoferritin and GABA receptor). 3. In Figure 5a, please clarify how you are normalizing the B-factor. 4. Please deposit output models in Zonodo or some other public repository. 5. What does SMOCf stand for?

I hope this will be done more in the future with other initiatives as well. Though, I personally do have several queries with respect to the SciCV effectiveness and this preprint. With respect to the academic age, in addition to the time take off for parental leave etc. another omission in the manuscript is that in some labs / countries it's common to not publish during their PhD and some labs / countries where it's mandatory to publish to pass their viva which is not taken into account in the academic age. In addition to this, the academic age does not take into account that some students might publish during their BSc or MSc or are included as co-authors on papers during their BSc or MSc. All of these affects the academic age metric without affecting the applicants ability or suitability to be awarded funding. The academic age also does not take into account any time spent in institutions where bullying and harassment has occurred affecting someone's productivity and I would argue this could effectively decrease someone's academic age. In addition the academic age metric could be misused by students and delaying their PhD publications to the last year of their PhD to decrease their academic age and make it come across as if they've got more potential compared to PhD students who didn't do this or weren't advised to do so. So to me the academic age just appears to be another metric that does not (accurately) reflect the applicants capabilities or even career stage. One of my main concerns with respect to the narrative CV and another query with respect to the preprint is related to the section in 'Interviews' on the narratives. (1) ""The interviews indicate that applicants disliked the amount of time needed to author narratives"". Based on my own personal experience (the narrative CV for an EPSRC grant caused major anxiety and was the single task that prevented me from submitting the grant proposal) I suspect that potential applicants with anxiety, caring responsibility, dyslexia, etc. will struggle a lot more with completing this task and as it did in my case prevent them from submitting their grant proposal. So did the authors attempt to investigate this, what is the authors opinion on this? Would including people that were not able to submit grant applications in the interviews and survey change the conclusion that the ""SciCV was a relevant and successful initiative""? (2) ""redundancy and the use of boastful language in narratives were also criticised by some reviewers."" To me this comes across as if the narrative CV will benefit those most with the best support or understanding how to 'play the system': the politicians, not the applicants with most potential to complete a research project successfully. Finally, my last query about the preprint is related to the final paragraph in the discussion: ""Not surprisingly, SciCV alone had only a limited effect on the adherence to DORA-conformity during evaluation. ... Other funding organisations experimenting with new, text-based CV format such as the Science Foundation Ireland report similar findings [10], highlighting the need for additional accompanying measures such as clear guidelines or training."" With (such) a limited effectiveness of the SciCV/narrative CV, I am curious how the authors come to the conclusion that the ""SciCV was a relevant and successful initiative"". Also, is it worth requiring applicants to put in significantly more effort creating such document for the submission for grant applications with limited effectiveness, and when even then still additional measures are needed for the process to be fair? The authors suggest such measures to be clear guidance and training, which, frankly, assessors and reviewers could easily ignore and let their personal (implicit or explicit) biases guide their assessment or review. So to me, the narrative CV, albeit well intended (and before trying to write one myself I thought this was/could be an amazing intervention) comes across as trying to make life of the reviewers and assessors more easy while creating significantly more work for the applicants, potentially preventing them from even submitting a grant application. Has the narrative CV/SciCV been compared to other interventions that create less work for the applicant and force reviewers/assessors to adhere to DORA and remove any chance for biases to guide assessments/reviews, such as double blind review (e.g.: https://smallpondscience.co...

We were aware of previous observations on Ca2+ leakage, but unfortunately, our current structures do not provide good insights into its mechanism. In all our inhibitor-bound structures, the pore of Sec61 is essentially closed by the plug, and thus it seems unlikely that the channel permeates Ca2+ through its pore in the observed conformations. However, like other structural studies, our study also comes with certain limitations, such as difficulties in gauging the dynamics of the channel complex. Also we cannot rule out other Ca2+ permeation paths besides the central pore. We believe that these aspects are something we will have to look into carefully in the future.

Review synthesized by Michael Robichaux. The manuscript reports findings from new knockout human cell lines for the mitochondrial release factors mtRF1 and mtRF1a. The work contributes new insight into mitochondrial protein translation and mechanisms related to mitochondrial disease. A specific role is demonstrated for the release factor mtRF1 in the translation of COX1, a mitochondrial respiratory protein. The manuscript also identified a compensatory role for the mitochondrial ribosome-associated quality control (mtRQC) pathway when mitochondrial translation termination is impaired. Overall the experiments and results presented in the manuscript are supportive of the conclusions described in the text. These findings are impactful toward understanding mitochondrial translation termination. Major comments In the results section related to Figure 1d, an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) is measured using the mitoSOX probe. Considering that mitoSOX measures superoxide accumulation in the mitochondria, please consider specifying in the text that the ROS measured is of mitochondrial origin. In addition, since mitoSOX labeling may be affected by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential or mitochondrial shape and size, please consider adding an experimental condition using a membrane-potential-responsive, redox-insensitive probe. Finally, please clarify the results presented in Figure 1d with more technical detail. What do the n-values signify? Technically, how is ROS production measured? For Figure 2b-d, in gel activity for complex I and IV are measured; please provide further technical details for these experiments. Please describe what kind of activity is being measured and how it is measured. Also consider adding a density graph of these gel data for clarification of the results. Referencing Figure 2b-c, specifically, it is stated in the Results section that “ mtRF1 loss does not affect complex I.. ”; however, the figure shows an increase in activity of ~20% for the mtRF1-/- condition. Please consider rephrasing or clarifying this point. For Figure 3, there is a possible discrepancy in these results that may need to be addressed. For example, the difference of the relative intensity of ND6 between the WT vs. mtRF1a-/- conditions shown in Fig 3a is significantly less than what is quantified for the same comparison in the bar graph in Fig 3e. It is possible these analyses were performed differently; if so, please report this. Minor comments It is stated in the first Results section: “ In the absence of mtRF1a, cells tend to produce more reactive oxygen species (ROS)... ”, which is vague, please rewrite more technically since it is describing the quantitative data in Fig 1D. From this same section, the final statement: “Thus, both release factors are critical for mitochondrial function and cellular growth” is perhaps too conclusive based only on the results from Figure 1. Related to Fig 1c: consider converting the graph to a log scale, which may help illustrate the difference in growth rates between conditions. In addition to measuring cellular growth, please also consider measuring/counting mitochondria and examining cell morphology changes, which may be easy, additive experiments to include here. In the Results section related to Fig. 2a-d, the respiratory chain complexes are presented with no context. Consider mentioning these complexes in the Introduction or contextualizing them better in this section. In this same Results section please add appropriate citations for “Figure 2g” when referencing results related to that figure panel. A portion of the results text related to Figure 4a-b states: “ With the exception of MTND6 (mRNA encoding for ND6), all of the mt-mRNAs arise from the polycistronic transcript synthesized from the heavy strand. If the loss of mitochondrial RFs would affect mitochondrial transcription, one would expect an overall decrease in all mitochondrial transcripts. However, as we observe a selective decrease in specific transcripts in the individual knockouts, we conclude that it is more likely an issue of RNA stability rather than synthesis.” This may be more appropriate to include in the Discussion section. In the Results section related to Figure 5, please again consider properly citing the figures when describing the results presented in those figures and panels. While Figure 6 is an informative model figure, please consider explaining the model with respect to results in the manuscript. Comments on reporting Please consider adding more detail in the Methods section about the statistical analyses performed in this study. In addition, other statistical tests may be needed for some group comparisons (e.g., two-way ANOVA for the data in Fig. 5d). For all the western blot data presented in the manuscript, please consider adding the full blot scans to the supplemental material. Referencing Supplementary Table S1, please consider adding validation references for the antibodies used in this study. This is of great benefit to other researchers.

Notably, Eeyarestatin 1 as well as Mycolactone were previously shown to enhance Sec61-mediated Ca2+ leakage from the ER in human cells, which can lead to apoptosis and, therefore, appears as medically relevant.

Review synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. The paper studies the involvement of aneuploidy in promoting chromosomal instability and suggests the aneuploid state of cancer cells as a point-mutation independent source of genome instability. The paper reports a considerable amount of data. We outline below some suggestions regarding presentation and the analyses reported: ‘ mis-segregation in otherwise pseudo-diploid human cells’ - Please provide some explanation for the term ‘pseudo-diploid’. ‘ suggesting that dormant replication origins’ - Please provide a sentence clarifying the meaning of ‘dormant replication’. ‘Cells activate dormant origins in response to reduced fork rate and stalled forks to ensure that the genome gets fully replicated in time ’ - Please provide a reference to support this statement. Figure 3 Recommend re-arranging the order and position of the panels for greater clarity. ‘ Interestingly, we found a positive correlation between S phase length and frequency of abnormal mitoses (mean S phase length in control: 603,3 ± 55,4; aneuploid: 728,7 ± 46,2) (Fig. 3c). ’ - Figure 3C shows that the cells that have an abnormal mitosis had a slightly longer S phase on average, however there is no correlation analysis done or an analysis around ""frequency of abnormal mitosis"", recommend revising the sentence. more photo-toxicity -> abnormal mitosis. Recommend adding a control to account for the potential phototoxicity of the imaging. Figure 4 - Panels C and D show that, among the cells that have foci, the number of foci is increased, either by aneuploidy or by the drugs. However, it is unclear from the data if the number of cells with foci also increases. Would it be possible to plot the % of cells with more than 1 foci for each condition? (as in Figure 4G). Also, C and D are aggregates of multiple experiments, it would be good to show the data per replicates. ‘there was a sub-population of senescent cells in the aneuploid sample (Fig. 5a) ’ - Was senescence tested in the normal (euploid) population too (at the same passage)? Is that the sample named as ""control"" in the figure legend? ‘ in aneuploid cycling cells was comparable to that of the controls for at least 3 generations by live-cell imaging (Fig. 6a-c) ’ - Suggest clarifying here what the control is, in addition to naming it in the figure legend. Comments on analyses/reporting In various figures (including Figures 1H,J,L,N,O; 2C,G,E; 3I; 4C,D; 5H,I; 6H,I,J), there is a concern about the statistical approach to calculate p-values based on multiple measurements or cells within each sample. The t-test assumes that each measurement is independent, and multiple cells within the same sample are not independent. Recommend either not reporting p-values or averaging together the values from each sample and calculating the p-value using those sample-level means. For more information, see https://doi.org/10.1371/jou... and https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb... For each bar graph throughout the paper, recommend reporting the value of n, in the figure itself, the figure legend, or in the text. Using Figure 1C as an example, this reports a doubling in the number of cells with greater than 10 errors, but the significance of that would vary depending on the number of cells analyzed. Some plots in panels c and f have no error bars, and it would be useful to report the number of experiments. Almost every figure features representative images. The manuscript includes a massive amount of data already, but it may be relevant to show additional images in the supplement in cases where representative images are used in figures.

Review synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. The manuscript studies the role of the long-coding RNA lncRNA H19 in cellular senescence. The results show that H19 levels decline as cells undergo senescence and repression of H19 is triggered by the loss of CTCF and prolonged activation of p53. The loss of H19 leads to increased let7b-mediated targeting of EZH2. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin maintains lncRNA H19 levels throughout the cellular lifespan preventing reduction of EZH2 and cellular senescence. The reviewers found the methodology appropriate but raised some comments and suggestions about the paper as outlined below: Introduction ‘ H19 is a highly conserved, maternally expressed imprinted gene and encodes a 2.3 kb long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). It is located immediately downstream of the neighboring gene IGF2.’ - An additional reference to the expression pattern/levels of lncRNA H19 across 'normal' tissues/developmental stages would be useful to provide immediate insight into the contexts where H19 is important and note the conditions where its levels are altered. ‘ To characterize the role of H19 in the cellular senescence of somatic cells, we examined H19 expression during replicative senescence of human cardiac fibroblasts ’ - The data on changes in expression of H19 with age/culture time is very interesting. Suggest providing some comments on the choice of experimental systems for each experiment and why HCF cells were used to study replicative senescence while other experiments were completed in skin samples. Figure 1 Figure 1a - Please indicate in the legend how far apart or what are the passage numbers for 'early' and 'late' passages for the cell culture experiments. Is the reduction in H19 gradual or does it sharply decrease after a certain number of passages? What biological meaning would either of these observations have and how does it relate to mouse data in vivo? Supplementary Figure 1 shows a sharp drop between PD 20 and PD 50. Would it be possible to provide a finer analysis of H19 levels across many cell passages? Figure 1b - Recommend using the same normalization in a) and b). In a) levels are normalized to the first condition ""early"" while in b) levels are normalized to the second condition ""old"". Figures 1d and g - Please provide further information on how Cumulative population doublings were measured and clarification for the numbers on the Y axis. ‘ decreased the lifespan of cells (Figure 1d; Figure 1-figure supplement 1c) ’ - Figure 1d measures cells' doubling time, not lifespan. If lifespan is being inferred from doubling time, please provide some clarification on how this is being done. There are fewer cells after 15 days but it does not mean that cells are dying, it could be that they are growing slower. Please also provide details for the methodology followed to obtain the data in this panel. Figure 2 ‘ CTCF mRNA and protein levels decreased in the late passage cells (Figure 2a and b), and CTCF knockdown in early passage cells induced premature senescence characterized by increased SA-β-gal staining and reduction in proliferation (Figure 2-figure supplement 2a). In contrast, treatment with rapamycin mitigated CTCF depletion, which is consistent with the effect of rapamycin maintaining H19 levels (Figure 2a and b). Furthermore, the regulatory link between CTCF and H19 is supported by decreased H19 expression in CTCF-targeted cells (Figure 2c). ’ - CTCF knockdown and rapamycin treatment can affect many pathways, recommend toning down this conclusion. In Supplemental Figure 2a, the % of positive cells in the siNeg condition is significantly higher than in Figure 1e (close to 50% in Sup Fig 2a vs 30 % in Fig 1e). Recommend providing some comments on the variability of the control value as that level of variability can confound the conclusions. For example, the siCTCF condition is lower than the siNeg control condition when compared with the value from Sup Fig 2a but not when compared with the value from Fig 1e. Figure 2d - Remove""presentation last saved just now"" from the panel. ‘ a stress-dependent downregulation of CTCF through proteasomal degradation of CTCF protein in endothelial cells (51)’ - The paper cited here discusses epithelial cells, should the reference to endothelial cells be updated? Figure 3 - Please provide further clarification regarding acute stress or prolonged activation of p53. What are the timescales? How do these relate to replicative senescence seen with aging or as cells at late passages? ‘ Together these results confirm that activation of p53 is responsible for the downregulation of H19 as part of DNA damage response ’ - Please provide further clarification regarding the reference to DNA damage. Is this an inference from the statement about ""activation of p53 is crucial for establishing senescence as part of DDR""? p53, like CTCF and mTOR, can play different roles. ‘ Given the mounting evidence suggesting the role of lncRNA H19 as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) or miRNA sponge (60–62), we speculated that H19 might mediate the senescence program by regulating miRNA availability. To determine which miRNAs are directly regulated by lncRNA H19 during senescence, we evaluated miRNA expression profiles in control and H19 targeted cells (Figure 4a). ’ - Can some further clarification be provided for this claim, if H19 is acting as a miRNA sponge, it wouldn't affect its overall levels, but rather its ability to bind its target genest? Based on the data presented, the link between let7b and H19 appears to be more related to let7b expression than sequestration. Consider removing the fragment or revising it to clarify the mechanistic link drawn between H19 and let7b. To show that H19 is acting as a sponge in this system, it may be necessary to mutate the complementary sequence and check whether let7b's activity increases (i.e. its target genes are down-regulated). ‘ Among the top miRNAs upregulated in H19 depleted cells were members of the let7 family; specifically, let7b expression was significantly upregulated (Figure 4b ’ - Suggest adding some more information about the other miRNAs that are affected. Figure 4f ‘ Senescence-associated secretory ’ - Please clarify why SERPINE mRNA level is considered instead of IL-6 as in Figure 1f. ‘ suggests the loss of EH2 results in a general decrease in PRC2 activity ’ - should EH2 read EZH2? Figure 5 - What happens to CDKN2A levels when H19 is depleted or overexpressed? Can the H3Kme3 antibody binding data be supported with expression data for CDKN2A? It may be relevant to see whether it follows the expectation that loss of H19 reduces EZH2 expression and increases p16 expression. Figure 6 - Please provide some brief clarification for what the solid and dashed lines represent in the model. ‘ More importantly, prolonged treatment with mTOR inhibitor rapamycin maintains lncRNA H19 levels by preventing the loss of CTCF expression and activation of p53, thus preventing the induction of senescence. ’ - There is a question as to whether the experiments presented support this statement, suggest reframing the fragment. The strongest mechanistic experiments in the study are those regarding let7b, because they use the mimic to ""rescue"" its function. Supplementary Figure 1d - It is nice to see authors tested 2 different siRNAs for H19 and these showed the same effect in Panel d. Can some discussion be provided for why overexpression of H19 leads to an increase in senescence markers and reduced proliferation.The outcomes of siRNA experiments may not sufficiently support the correlation between H19 levels and senescence induction. This is an example where both excess H19 and reduced levels of H19 have the same effect and it is a very important result. Would it be possible to titrate the expression of H19 to achieve different levels of overexpression and then analyze senescence markers under these conditions? It may also be possible to generate a siRNA-resistant overexpression construct to rescue the effects seen with siRNA-mediated depletion of H19. Supplementary Figure 5 - Recommend updating the presentation to more clearly highlight the decrease in binding as mentioned in the main text. Methods ‘ 10g of plasmid DNA was transfected ’ - should this read 10 micrograms? ‘ ΔΔCT method ’ - Please clarify the control for calculating relative mRNA levels. ‘ Cells were incubated with EdU stain (100mM Tris (pH8.5), 1mM CuSO4, 1.25 μM Azide Fluor 488, and 50mM ascorbic acid) at room temperature for 30 mins.

Leroux we have written an extended commentary with our opinion on the work, which can be found in the link: https://www.qeios.com/read/.... In short, we find that the authors do not properly cite previous work, notably the Gao and Harris paper (2006) that reaches similar conclusions. In addition, the introduction fails to acknowledge even basic issues. For example, the classical PKCs are constitutively phosphorylated by PDK1 without growth factor signaling. Akt/PKB becomes phosphorylated by PDK1 in a  PI3-kinase dependent manner but also has been described to become phosphorylated by PDK1 in a PI3-kinase INDEPENDENT manner. In contrast to what Levina et al. indicate in the introduction, a model to explain PDK1 phosphorylation of substrates must take into consideration that some substrates are phosphorylated in a PIP3-independent manner! For a detailed commentary on the results section, again I recommend that you go to the qeios link above. Most of the hard biochemistry in the paper is dedicated to describing the dimer that must be formed along the very very slow process of trans-autophosphorylation in vitro. The hard-core biochemical studies are based on a fusion of PDK1 to PIF. It is difficult to understand what useful information can be obtained from those ""dimers""... PIF binds with high affinity to PDK1: what would be the sense of crosslinking GST-PIF to PDK1? would you obtain any information about the  GST/ PDK1 heterodimers??? If the model was correct, PIFtide should inhibit trans-autophosphorylation. The authors did not do this control experiment. But it was done previously: this was NOT observed in the paper by Frödin et al (2000). So the dimer model with an important hydrophobic motif binding to the PIF-pocket in the neighbour molecule is very likely incorrect. Finally the authors claim autoinhibition by the PH domain and release of this autoinhibition by PIP3. I have not yet seen any convincing data to support the existence of an autoinhibited PDK1. Please, refer to the qeios link for further details. In short, I believe that the conclusion of this part of the work is also not supported by their data nor by 25 years of careful work by different laboratories.",2022-08-14T20:38:52,ricardombiondi,Ricardo M.

Compared to the bioRxiv manuscript, the JEV paper includes additional experimental results, such as proteomic analysis of plasma EVs isolated by asymmetric depth filtration. We also added the comparison with a multistep precipitation-purification sequence for plasma EV isolation. The published paper provides a mechanistic explanation of high purity and yields achieved with the developed method. The proposed mechanism is tested by demonstrating the size selectivity for synthetic samples and the selectivity by the elasticity of captured nanoparticles, which we analyzed by capturing rigid and soft nanoparticles (latex beads and pre-isolated EVs) using the developed method.",2022-08-10T17:32:04,mishaskliar,Misha Skliar,10.1101/2021.08.23.457333,Asymmetric depth-filtration – a versatile and scalable approach for isolation and purification of extracellular vesicles,"Vasiliy S.
