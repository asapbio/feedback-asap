This includes the structural characterization of the mechanism of inhibition at both active-sites, which importantly revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 NiRAN domain contains a guanine-specific pocket. This has now been confirmed in other studies 2,3, and represents a promising avenue for future drug development studies. Following several contradictory reports on the ability of the NiRAN to NMPylate different cofactor proteins (4–6), we have now carried out additional analysis on the protein-priming activity and NMPylation specificity. This has revealed that our nsp8 product is labeled at the primary amine of a non-native glycine residue, present at the N-terminus of the expression construct (following cleavage with TEV protease), and negating the biological relevance of these findings. Surprisingly, removal of this single residue, exposing the true N-terminal alanine, eliminates all labeling and protein-primed activity, stressing the importance for using proteins with native N- and C- termini. Of note, the current publication does not reflect these new findings, but instead has been left as the initially submitted manuscript. Later studies have now revealed nsp9 to be the primary target for both NMPylation5,7, and RNAylation8 – a conclusion that we fully agree with. With the exception of our finding that nsp8 can be used to prime-synthesis, albeit by a non-native residue, there was no other evidence for protein-priming until recently. In October, 2023, Schmidt et al., published the finding that nsp9 is covalently linked to the 5' end of positive- and negative-sense RNA produced during SARS-CoV-2 infection9. This linkage was found to be regulated by its interaction with the host protein, staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1 (SND1),  which was found to specifically recognize the 5’ end of negative-sense RNA and be important for viral RNA synthesis. Although it is highly frustrating to have spent several years focused on the wrong protein, this finding supports the notion that protein-priming is occurring in CoVs, and opens up a plethora of options for further mechanistic and structural studies. Of note, Schmidt et al. also showed that nsp9-linkage on the (-)sense strand mapped roughly between the genome and poly(A) tail. Intriguingly, we also found a similar specificity for this region. Here we show that the SARS-CoV mRTC (nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) can initiate synthesis through a de novo, NiRAN independent pathway, through the synthesis of a pppGpU primer. This dinucleotide is complementary to the last two nucleotides of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, located precisely at the genome-poly(A) junction. De novo initiation was found to directly compete with the (artificial) nsp8-poly(U) protein-primed synthesis. This shows that the poly(A) tail and 3’ genomic RNA sequence elements guide the positioning of the mRTC to the true 3’-end of the genome. The specific details behind initiation of RNA synthesis, including the role of SND1 and potential coordination between protein-priming and/or de novo induction remains to be studied. Synthesis initiation, and the precise role of the NiRAN therefore appears to be a complicated story, which remains to be fully elucidated.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262v1#comment-6520634471,biorxivstage,1,"Summary : Zhan et al argue that nearly identical (>99.9% in the S gene or across a whole genome) sequences sampled within a single species indicate transmission within a single species subsequent to a period of host adaptation, assuming the necessity of adaptive mutations in any new host. They repeatedly claim that similar identical genomes were never sampled in different species in SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004. This is incorrect. In fact, the data cited in this paper includes at least four examples of 100% sequence identity in samples from different species. Thus, the statement ""In the SARS-CoV outbreaks, >99.9% genome or S identity was only observed among isolates collected within a narrow window of time from within the same species"" was incorrect. Example 1 : Figure 5 and the manuscript discuss samples SZ3 and SZ16 collected from palm civets in 2004 in Dongmen market in Shenzhen. However, sample SZ13, reported from the same study (Guan et al, Science 2003, accession AY304487) is not mentioned. It was collected from a raccoon dog and it is 100% identical to SZ16 over 8581 bases in a partial genome sequence inclusive of S. Furthermore, Guan et al also reported neutralization of SZ16 infection by sera from masked palm civets (3 of 6 samples), raccoon dog (1 of 1), Chinese ferret badger (1 of 2), and human (12/55; 8/20 for humans in wild animal trade). This indicates widespread infection of diverse species by SARS with >99.9% identical genomes without requiring further host adaptation. It's possible this error is inherited from Song et al (PNAS 2005), which twice states that SZ13 is a sample from a civet. This error is perplexing since the primary source for this data is clear on what animals were sampled and sequence identity. What's less well known is that Dongmen market continued to be sampled after May (Yaqing et al, Disease Surveillance 2004). Civets, raccoon dogs, and badgers were still available for sampling and still positive by PCR for SARS in October, November, and December 2003. It wasn't until spillover from civets to humans was definitively shown for the Guangzhou outbreak (Wang et al, Emerg Infect Dis 2005) that Guangdong province acted to close wildlife markets and end the civet trade. Dr. Garry notes similar findings at Xinyuan market in Guangzhou in January 2024. Example 2 and 3 : Zhan et al write, ""The human and civet isolates of the 2003/2004 outbreak, which were collected most closely in time and at the site of cross-species transmission, shared only up to 99.79% S identity.” This is incorrect. Wang et al (Emergency Infect Dis 2005) write, ""The 286-bp S gene sequences from isolates from the waitress and the physician were identical to 4 of 5 S gene sequences from palm civets from the restaurant.” Example 4 : The 99.79% identical sequence described by Wang et al (Emergency Infect Dis 2005) is instead from a different patient without a known link to the civet or other animal trade — a patient identified about one month before the first patient in the restaurant cluster. However, “An isogenic strain with the same SNV pattern, B012G, was detected in a palm civet from the Xinyuan animal market” (Kan et al J Virol 2005). Conclusion : Repeated claims of no examples of 99.9% identical viruses in different species during SARS outbreaks were provably incorrect when this manuscript was preprinted. Furthermore, the manuscript appeals to near-identity of sequences obtained within Huanan market. Subsequently, it has been shown that both lineage A and lineage B were found in environmental sampling of Huanan market. I hope that authors will revisit their conclusions given the reality of the facts they based their arguments on.",2024-08-05T20:26:55,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,,,,

After its submission, the manuscript, which details the development and performance of probes with nanomolar affinities to the gp120 receptor for detecting SIV uptake in vivo, was under editorial consideration until July 24th, 2024. It was subsequently rejected before being sent to external reviewers. The grounds for rejection were that the technical advances presented, specifically the demonstration of negative results, would not have a sufficiently significant and immediate impact on a broader readership. An appeal was submitted on July 25th, 2024, emphasizing the high expected impact of our findings, particularly in light of their potential to challenge the validity of a decade's worth of studies and highlighting the ongoing reproducibility crisis in scientific research that has been increasingly discussed in recent years. It was argued that the publication of such studies is crucial for fostering scientific integrity and progress. If scientific journals do not embrace and publish studies that challenge established findings from prestigious journals, we (as entire scientific community) risk stagnating in our efforts to address the reproducibility crisis. Our study, which demanded significant manpower and resources, exemplifies this challenge. The probability that research teams will mobilize substantial resources to address reproducibility issues (like we did in our study) is minimal, if not nonexistent, unless the editorial community values and supports these contributions.

The authors suggest that mutation to an isoleucine residue at position nsp16 I219 will ""occur without having a significant impact on fitness linked to a disruptive function at a protein level."" The residue I219 is well resolved in crystal structures (e.g. PDB 6WVN) and makes hydrophobic contacts with other hydrophobic sidechains, suggesting that this is unlikely to be the case. This is testable by mutational fitness analysis -- https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2-mut-fitness/nsp16.html -- out of possible non-synonymous mutations that are sufficiently sampled during the pandemic, I219 tolerates substitution to leucine or valine, methionine is slightly disfavored, and mutation to any of arginine, lysine, or threonine is very rare. This suggests a significant fitness impact of substitutions at this position.",2024-07-23T16:05:44,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,,,,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.18.604213v1#comment-6510704486,biorxivstage,1,"This preprint claims that the BA.2.86 lineage, which first appeared in the sequencing record in late July 2023, evolved gradually, while cryptically circulating over the course of about 17 months, beginning in early 2022. I do not find any of the evidence presented here convincing. Three clusters of sequences, named C1, C2, and C3, are cited as evidence of cryptic BA.2.86 circulation prior to its emergence on the world stage. Each cluster has a far simpler, more parsimonious explanation than the hypothesis presented by the authors. I have documented and analyzed cluster C1 as they have been uploaded, beginning in October 2023, and it appears to be a classic case of a chronic infection in an immunocompromised individual who may have transmitted to one other person. Three of the four C1 sequences have matching metadata—same location, age, and sex—while the fourth has the same location and age but a different sex. Furthermore, there are two additional, closely related sequences collected in 2024 (EPI_ISL_18969735 and EPI_ISL_19259365) whose metadata also match the other three. It seems very unlikely the C1 sequences have any relation to BA.2.86. I count approximately 17 spike substitutions and one large deletion (∆138-144) that are in two or more of these four sequences but not in BA.2.86, including P9L, H69D, K77E, T95I, ∆136-144, R158K, Q183E, G213E, D215G, R346T, L452R, F486L, V615A, V642G, H681Y, L841R, D936Y, and D1146N. None of the four C1 sequences have the most distinctive spike mutations of BA.2.86, such as ins16MPLF, the triple-nucleotide F157S-R158G, A264D, I332V, K356T, L452W, or ∆V483. All C1 sequences have ORF1a:L3201F, which is found in BA.2 but not BA.2.86, and none of the C1 sequences possess any of the seven synonymous mutations found in the BA.2.86 branch (C8293T, T13339C, T15756A, A18492G, C21622T, C25207T, C26681T). Of the more than 30 spike mutations (relative to baseline BA.2) in BA.2.86, I only see four that are shared between BA.2.86 and the C1 sequences: R403K, A484K, R493Q (reversion), and P621S. All of these are extremely convergent in highly mutated, chronic-infection sequences. I maintain a list of such sequences, and the R493Q reversion is the single most common private mutation, occurring 304 times independently, while R403K appears 103 times, and P621S 60 times. A484K, despite being a two-nucleotide mutation, has independently evolved at least 15 times among the sequences I've recorded. (G446S—very common both in chronic-infection sequences and circulating lineages—is in 2/6 sequences from this cluster). Furthermore, the most recently uploaded sequence from this cluster—collected on May 22, 2024, but not listed in the C1 cluster in this paper—contains 16 new spike mutations (at least two of which I suspect can be attributed to sotrovimab treatment). Four of the 16 new spike mutations are also in BA.2.86 (I332V, K356T, L486P, and S939F), a textbook example of how, through convergent intrahost evolution, chronic-infection sequences can come to acquire mutations found in other chronic infections and in unrelated circulating lineages. I do not see any resemblance between BA.2.86 and the C1 cluster in the non-spike part of the genome, apart from M:A104V, which is commonly found in chronic-infection sequences (32 independent acquisitions by my count), and is also found in the Pango-designated GS.4/5 lineage (XBB.2.3.11.4/5). It seems to me that this is a case of a chronically infected, immunocompromised individual who developed a few mutations also found in BA.2.86—mutations which are convergent in such chronic infections—and who may have transmitted to one other person (assuming there was not a mistake in the sex assignment of EPI_ISL_18415854, in which case these sequences almost certainly all came from the same patient). The phylogenetic relationship between these sequences, as determined by USHER (Ultrafast Sample placement on Existing tRee, created at University of California Santa Cruz and maintained by Angie Hinrichs), can be seen at the following link: https://nextstrain.org/fetch/raw.githubusercontent.com/ryhisner/posited_BA.2.86_intermediates/main/BA.2.86_C1_posited_intermediates_Mexico_6_seq.json?c=gt-S_841&gmax=25384&gmin=21563&label=id:node_3061533 The C2 cluster (12 sequences of XBB.1.5.90, 11 from Japan, one from Finland) does not seem to resemble BA.2.86 at all. It is part of a large branch of XBB.1.5.90 (>400 sequences) with S:P621S, also found in BA.2.86, and the only other private mutation I see that it shares with BA.2.86 (but not other hundreds of other XBB.1.5.90 sequences) is C26681T, which is a highly homoplasic synonymous mutation in the coding region of M. Perhaps I am overlooking something, but the C2 cluster looks like a relatively humdrum branch of XBB.1.5.90 to me. The Usher tree for these 12 sequences from C2 can be viewed here: https://nextstrain.org/fetch/raw.githubusercontent.com/ryhisner/posited_BA.2.86_intermediates/main/BA.2.86_C2_posited_intermediates_JPN_FIN_12_seq.json?c=userOrOld&label=id:node_4041697 The C3 cluster consisting of 10 sequences from Sarawak, Malaysia, were all uploaded on the same day (2024-1-25), bear the same collection date (2022-3-11), and have spikes identical to JN.1—including S:L455S—from S:356 to S:681, while the rest of spike is identical to baseline BA.2. The remainder of the genome in these sequences is extremely odd. Two sequences contain the XBB mutation ORF1b:S959P. Seven have the universal BA.2.86 mutation ORF1a:N2526S, while three lack it. One has the BA.2.86.1 mutation ORF1a:K1973R. Seven of the ten have ORF1a:L3201F, which is absent from all BA.2.86. No dropout is indicated in any of the sequences. The same Malaysian lab uploaded 321 other sequences (EPI_ISL_18821317-18821647), all from Sarawak, Malaysia, on the same day they uploaded the 10 C3 sequences. The collection dates of these sequences range from 2022-2-27 to 2024-1-9 and include 153 JN.1* sequences and 12 XBB* sequences. As Zach Hensel has noted, six of the ten C3 sequences have G19677T (ORF1b:2070H), which is the defining mutation of BA.2.40, a variant that made up about 60% of all sequences in Sarawak, Malaysia, in mid-March 2022. (Source: https://cov-spectrum.org/explore/Malaysia/AllSamples/from%3D2022-01-15%26to%3D2022-04-28/variants?nextcladeQcSnpClustersScoreTo=55&variantQuery=Nextcladepangolineage%3ABA.2.40*&) Sixty-three sequences in this upload are categorized by Nextclade as being BA.2.40 and have 0-3 mutations relative to baseline BA.2.40. Most suspicious of all, 29 of the 153 JN.1* sequences in this same upload also have G19677T. From July 1, 2023 to the present, just 77 sequences categorized by CovSpectrum as BA.2.86*  (from 13 different Pango-designated lineages) have had G19677T, with 30 of those coming from Malaysia. (Source: https://cov-spectrum.org/explore/World/AllSamples/from%3D2023-07-01%26to%3D2024-07-14/variants?variantQuery=Nextcladepangolineage%3ABA.2.86*+%26+G19677T&) It seems clear that the 10 C2 sequences were BA.2 sequences contaminated by JN.1 sequences from the same upload. The authors list 129 sequences they claim shorten the branch leading to BA.2.86, of which I was able to find 128 on GISAID. Ten of these sequences are from the C3 Malaysian cluster described above, along with one additional sequence from the same upload. Apart from these C3 sequences, there are only six sequences with collection dates preceding the first BA.2.86 sequences. All others were collected more than seven weeks after the first BA.2.86 sequences. Six sequences were collected between 7-14 weeks after the first BA.2.86, while the remaining 105 sequences were collected more than 15 weeks afterward. It would be surprising if one could not find hundreds of such ""hybrid"" sequences due purely to contamination. Such sequences have frequently appeared in the sequencing record throughout the pandemic. A few sequences may result from coinfection, but the quality of these sequences, described below, along with the fact that a large proportion of them come from a small number of labs with records of quality-control issues, support the hypothesis that these sequences result from contamination or other lab errors. All of the sequences in this list are low quality. They feature a mixture of extensive dropout (particularly in spike), frameshifts, large numbers of mixed nucleotides, clearly artifactual reversions, and mutations from multiple lineages (primarily BA.2.86 and XBB) with no distinct breakpoints. Many of these sequences come from labs known to have frequent quality-control issues. For example, there are 52 sequences from the United States, but none are from the CDC, whose sequences are virtually always first-rate. Instead, they come from smaller local and state labs, whose sequencing quality is often inconsistent. The 28 sequences from Texas, for example, come from city hospitals. The average Nextclade qc score of these sequences is 2901 (median 2882). Anything over 100 is designated ""bad"" by Nextclade. The average number of ambiguous nucleotides per sequences is 17 (median 17), and they average 690 nucleotides of dropout. (EPI_ISL_16599325, EPI_ISL_16599747, EPI_ISL_18546432, EPI_ISL_18690036, EPI_ISL_18690080, EPI_ISL_18690421, EPI_ISL_18690466, EPI_ISL_18690496, EPI_ISL_18743044, EPI_ISL_18743073, EPI_ISL_18743094, EPI_ISL_18743097, EPI_ISL_18743159, EPI_ISL_18743350, EPI_ISL_18743431, EPI_ISL_18743464, EPI_ISL_18743470, EPI_ISL_18743477, EPI_ISL_18743592, EPI_ISL_18816401, EPI_ISL_18816517, EPI_ISL_18816528, EPI_ISL_18816612, EPI_ISL_18816709, EPI_ISL_18816890, EPI_ISL_18816980, EPI_ISL_18874714, EPI_ISL_18908998) Similarly, the 17 sequences on this list from Italy are all from the same lab, have an average Nextclade qc score of 2356 (median 2253) and average 1349 nucleotides of dropout. Some sequences on the list are somewhat less bad than these, but none are high-quality. (EPI_ISL_18496352, EPI_ISL_18674020, EPI_ISL_18677248, EPI_ISL_18721993, EPI_ISL_18722001, EPI_ISL_18722007, EPI_ISL_18722009, EPI_ISL_18755145, EPI_ISL_18792827, EPI_ISL_18792828, EPI_ISL_18792829, EPI_ISL_18792831, EPI_ISL_18820147, EPI_ISL_18820149, EPI_ISL_18820150, EPI_ISL_18820154, EPI_ISL_18820157) Finally, I also examined the list of 100 sequences from Supplementary Data 1, Table 5, containing genomes posited by the authors to be recombinants related to ancestors of BA.2.86. These sequences seem to me to fall into five different categories. First, there are numerous sequences here that are also listed in one of the C1-C3 clusters—three sequences from C1 (EPI_ISL_18415832, EPI_ISL_18415854, EPI_ISL_18798234), three from C2 (EPI_ISL_18040349, EPI_ISL_18060516, EPI_ISL_18106303, EPI_ISL_18116248), and four from C3 (EPI_ISL_18821484, EPI_ISL_18821485, EPI_ISL_18821487). Second, nine of the sequences appear to be fairly unremarkable XDD sequences, which is a designated JN.1/EG.5.1.1 recombinant (EPI_ISL_18617332, EPI_ISL_18706019, EPI_ISL_18706171, EPI_ISL_18553650, EPI_ISL_18653986, EPI_ISL_18531477, EPI_ISL_18569411, EPI_ISL_18695627). The third category consists of what seem to me to be relatively normal sequences from a variety of Omicron lineages but with little resemblance to BA.2.86. Some of them have extensive dropout and come from labs known for high rates of artifacts and contamination. (EPI_ISL_18076898, EPI_ISL_17990180,  EPI_ISL_18062641, EPI_ISL_18000549, EPI_ISL_18042058, EPI_ISL_18104305, EPI_ISL_18070023, EPI_ISL_18044667, EPI_ISL_18111437, EPI_ISL_15153261, EPI_ISL_17255807, EPI_ISL_15153261, EPI_ISL_16282414, EPI_ISL_16457740) The fourth category is BA.2.86 or JN.1 sequences that either don't strike me as very unusual or else have extensive dropout and artifactual reversions. A few of these are from unreliable labs. (EPI_ISL_18097345, EPI_ISL_18556860, EPI_ISL_18567791, EPI_ISL_18682823, EPI_ISL_18705393, EPI_ISL_18635682, EPI_ISL_18503709, EPI_ISL_18400531, EPI_ISL_18717823, EPI_ISL_18446586, EPI_ISL_18584588, EPI_ISL_18631046, EPI_ISL_18700743, EPI_ISL_18675075, EPI_ISL_18659819, EPI_ISL_18713456, EPI_ISL_18636806, EPI_ISL_18704459, EPI_ISL_18686183) The fifth and largest category is highly divergent sequences almost certainly deriving from chronic infections, but which appear to me to bear almost no resemblance to BA.2.86 apart from the possession of a few mutations that are widely convergent in such sequences. I've documented most of these, and almost all contain a large number of mutations and deletions not found in BA.2.86 and lack the vast majority of BA.2.86 mutations. I hope I haven't misinterpreted any of the authors' hypotheses or data. -Ryan Hisner",2024-07-23T16:03:09,ryhisner,ryhisner,,,,

Although there are many studies reporting LT efficacy using simulated data (i.e., growth models), as well as studies using pots and small mini-lysimeters (most in the glasshouse), in my view there are only two studies that have done a fair job of testing LT trait efficacy empirically in the field – Zaman-Allah et al. 2011 (DOI: 10.1093/jxb/err139) and Borrell et al. 2014 (DOI: 10.1111/nph.12869).  Of these two, Zaman-Allah et al. 2011 is probably the most convincing for me because it does what I think a test of this theory needs to do – demonstrate inverse correlation between early season water use and late season growth and/or yield across many genotypes, which is what we should expect if there is anything to this idea at all.  Although I think there are problems with the Zaman-Allah study, e.g., no leaf-level water use measurements and the use of mini-lysimeters, I think these authors largely avoided the errors of earlier and later efforts by examining many genotypes, and using very large mini-lysimeters, which likely avoided disruption of soil water uptake, root growth, and saturated soil water profiles. I think it should absolutely worry us that although limited transpiration theory is now over 50 years old (e.g., de Wit 1958, Nix 1975, Passioura 1972 & 1977), there are no other convincing empirical demonstrations of its efficacy across most soils and climates, which includes most agriculturally important soils and climates world wide.  Similar to the opportunity costs we should expect associated with reduced early season carbon income in plants (which are almost completely ignored in the LT literature), there are also opportunity costs to funding LT research where LT traits are unlikely to result in improved outcomes.  The most important of these being that potentially more promising traits and trait networks are not considered, evaluated, and targeted in breeding programs.",2024-07-23T01:54:17,disqus_EBNdeyhDEC,sean gleason,,,,

AI has provided the blue print for an artificial protein situated outside of evolved life. The marine organisms that actually evolved molecules to transduce blue wavelengths of light into longer wavelengths of other colors and reemit them for a reason having to do with natural selection have done it already. They evolved the fluorescent molecules. ESM3's value is solely commercial, and no doubt it will be a hop, skip and jump from making the sequence available to researchers to commercializing it as contrast dye. Its origins will soon be forgotten, but its effects on the environment, and therefore life, will undoubtedly be persistent and deleterious. Wrapping the report in intellectual arguments about evolution doesn't scientifically validate the claim that an AI-generated mutant is ""evolved"". Even if the AI endgame was reached--replacing all life with a human-devised approximation, and it was somehow achieved by pseudo-evolution--ESM3 would still have no evolutionary value since it was synthesized in isolation. AI mutated a protein: it didn't evolve a protein. Making scientifically invalid claims doesn't advance the case for AI. Just the opposite.",2024-07-21T18:44:35,MFacts,Terri Mitchell,,,,

Specifically, it focuses on the regulation of lipid metabolism via DH44 neuroendocrine cells. It is a follow-up on the work from the same lab where they showcased the importance of  TRP gamma in DH44 cells in regulating post-ingestive food selection (Dhakal et al 2022: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56726). Overall, this work adds to the growing body of work on DH44 neuroendocrine cells which appear to be crucial internal metabolic sensors. We have a few major comments and suggestions on the preprint which could help clarify the mechanisms by which TRP gamma regulates lipid metabolism. 1.	TRP gamma mutants exhibit higher TAG and protein levels compared to controls. Inhibition of DH44 neurons using Kir2.1 recaptiulates the phenotype of increased TAG however protein levels are unaffected. Since these manipulations are not restricted to the adult stage, it is not possible to rule out developmental defects. It would be beneficial to also include the fly weight for these manipulations to see if their size is altered by these manipulations. Also, is there any impact on developmental timing? 2.	The experiments implicating the role of AMPK in DH44 neurons are quite interesting. However, the link between TRP gamma activation, AMPK and DH44 signaling is missing. How is DH44 release altered when TRP gamma is knocked down specifically in DH44 neurons? 3.	The author rescue the increased TAG levels in TRP gamma mutants by driving UAS-TRP expression using DH44-GAL4. However, they also able to rescue the phenotype by expressing UAS-TRP in DH44-R2 expressing cells. As far as we are aware, DH44 and DH44-R2 represent two independent populations. This raises some questions. What is the identity of the DH44-R2 cells which normally express TRP? What is the importance of having TRP gamma in both the source (DH44 cells) and the target (DH44-R2 cells) to regulate lipid homeostasis? Wouldn’t modulation of DH44 release alone be sufficient to regulate lipid homeostasis? 4.	DH44 is released as a hormone from both the PI neurons in the brain and endocrine cells in the VNC ( https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-017-2682-y). Neither this or the previous study on TRP gamma in DH44 neurons examined the presence or absence of TRP gamma in DH44 neurons the VNC. It is not clear if the DH44-GAL4 used in this study targets the DH44 neurons in the VNC. 5.	General comment about structure: The manuscript could benefit if additional context was provided for some of the experiments. The experiments using metformin are interesting and a valuable addition. However, since the link between metformin and DH44 signaling was not explored, the rationale for conducting these experiments is not quite clear. Is the rescue of TAG levels with metformin in TRP gamma mutants DH44-dependent or is metformin directly acting on the fat body? Metformin treatment in DH44 > TRP RNAi flies can clarify this. 6.	The manuscript would benefit from having a model which includes all the components in this inter-organ pathway (TRP gamma, DH44 neurons, gut etc). Minor comment: 1.

Briefly, further investigation (using cov-spectrum and UShER phyloplace) identified four sequences from Mayasia with March 2022 collection dates containing both M:D3H and M:T30A: EPI_ISL_18821484 (in C3) EPI_ISL_18821485 (in C3) EPI_ISL_18821546 EPI_ISL_18821638 These all share G19677T, which is a mutation characterizing BA.2.40 in Malaysia which was common in March 2022 (760 out of 855 sequences worldwide with G19677T were found in Malaysia that month; 52% of sequences from from Sarawak, Malaysia collected in March 2022 have this mutation). Further, the three sequences that are placed by phyloplace are found together with other sequences from Malaysia. This identifies another sequence with M:D3H and M:T30A sampled in Malaysia, EPI_ISL_18821317. Other mutations in these sequences are shared with various other lineages prevalent in Malaysia in March 2022. One sequence with M:D3H and M:T30A, EPI_ISL_18821638, could not be placed by phyloplace, but NextClade calls it as BA.1.1 because it contains the BA.1-defining EPE insert in S. The manuscript notes, regarding the period of Omicron emergence, ""South Africa and Botswana, where genomic surveillance was more robust than in many other parts of Africa."" BA.2.86 emergence in Southern Africa is well supported: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43703-3 It is implausible that an intermediate between BA.2 and BA.2.86 would recombine with multiple lineages circulating in Malaysia and only be detected in Malaysia without leaving a trace in southern Africa given that this surveillance continued. Rather, I suspect that these observations are likely artifacts arising from processing samples collected in March 2022 together with samples collected in late 2023. This can be tested by comparing mutations in these sequences to those observed in BA.2.86* strains common in Malaysia in late 2023. The most common of these is JN.1, which contains S:L455S as well as the S deletion shown for the C3 sequences here.",2024-07-20T14:19:32,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,,,,

Macdonald (UCSF) Summary: Fusion oncoproteins occurring from genomic rearrangements are commonly observed in cancers and often drive oncogenesis. Although these fusions frequently involve kinases or transcription factors, they are a diverse group at both molecular and functional levels, and a unified description of their oncogenetic properties is lacking. Robust methods for predicting oncogenicity of unknown fusions would be immediately clinically useful, making this an important gap. At a more basic level, this points to a gap in our ability to describe a key biological phenomenon. Some recent work has tackled this problem by examining the physicochemical properties of fusion oncoproteins, notably [1], but this is essentially still an open question. In this manuscript, the authors present a language model of fusion oncoproteins, FusOn-pLM, by fine-tuning ESM-2 with two recent databases of human fusion oncoproteins. They compare random masking vs. one using their previous fine-tuned ESM-2 model SaLT&PepPr and benchmark their results on a number of tasks, demonstrating reasonably increased specificity on specific tasks and improvement with non-random masking. The model training and benchmarking are sound and convincingly demonstrate the improvement. Despite this, the lack of clarity about what unifies fusion oncogenes is a major challenge. Language models can be powerful ways to learn these sorts of definitions in a less biased way, and in that light this is an important step towards clarifying this basic gap. However, as written, the work uses a working definition of fusion oncogene that is based on physicochemical properties that may or may not be specific to oncogenes. Examining the benchmarking tasks the authors use makes this clearer: they are almost entirely predictions of condensate and IDR properties rather than oncogenetic ones. The one truly cancer-specific benchmark, differentiating carcinoma classes, is fairly narrow and no model performs particularly well here. As a result, we are unsure how strongly this model will perform in discrimination or generalization tasks. Another general problem for the field is the lack of negative controls. Gene fusions are relatively common mutations, but bona fide oncogenic fusions are a small fraction of all fusions, making this a class imbalance problem. Even within tumors, the majority of fusions are thought to be passengers rather than driver mutations. Any predictor should be able to discriminate between these, but the lack of good data on non-oncogenetic fusions makes this challenging. This is evident in this work, where the model’s discrimination is not strongly tested. In summary, we believe this is technically strong work which addresses a pressing need, and which also presents some general strategies for domain-specific language model fine-tuning, but which is unfortunately hamstrung by defects in the available data and conceptualization of the field that are outside of the authors’ control. As presented, it will be of interest to AI practitioners and oncofusion researchers, but the clinical utility is unclear. Major points: 1) As discussed, we think the concept of an “oncofusion” is somewhat diffuse, as it describes an extremely heterogeneous set of proteins. This makes the prediction task particularly difficult. While the introduction discusses the barriers to prediction of fusion oncoproteins due to their intrinsically disordered regions and large size, we believe a bit more care with the effective definition they are using is warranted. Related to this is the choice of FOdb to train their model, which is essentially a database of condensate properties of oncofusions rather than oncogenetic ones. The implications of this choice also warrant a bit more discussion. 2) We wonder if there is a class imbalance problem. The databases used to fine-tune their model have a small fraction of possible fusion proteins, and don’t contain large amounts of negative training information. We are thus unsure if FusOn-pLM’s significant improvements over ESM-2 are specific to driver fusion oncogenes. 3) The method is not contextualized with respect to prior work in computational oncofusion prediction and characterization. Such methods are few ([2],[3],[4],[5],[6] among others) but important to understand FusOn-pLM’s performance. 4) Several experimental datasets for fusion oncogenes have been published, including [7], [5], and [8]. FusON-pLM’s performance on these would be a compelling way to show its utility, as well as a more specific oncogenetic task. Minor points: 1) Figure 2D: Although FusON-pLM is doing a slightly better job at distinguishing carcinoma prediction into two classes (BRCA vs. STAD), the performance metrics are the worst across the board. What does this mean for the prediction problem overall? Does the fact that IDR and condensate properties are much better predicted mean that the model is actually not learning an oncogenetic task? This seems worthy of more discussion. 2) Figure 4A: The authors present a FusOn-pLM embedding visualization of fusion oncoproteins, along with the corresponding head and tail protein sequences. It would be beneficial to clarify whether the protein sequences used for the head and tail counterparts are full-length sequences or only up to the exon breakpoint that forms the chimeric fusion protein. This information can be included in the Materials and Methods section. 3) Figure 4A: The authors demonstrate that FusON-pLM is able to separate out fusions from their head and tail components. To demonstrate that it is learning more specific embeddings for fusion oncoproteins, a comparison of the embeddings with untuned ESM-2 would be appropriate. 4) Figure 4B: In the main text of results section the authors write “FusOn-pLM largely clusters sequences by key properties such as the fraction of polar, charged, and disordered residues as well as the propensity to form pi-pi and pi-cation interactions and prion-like domains, via the PLAC NLLR score.” From the data shown in Figure 4B, this conclusion seems fine for polar residues and NLLR scores, but not for disordered residues and pi-pi/pi-cation interaction propensity by eye. Without quantification of the clustering, we are not sure this statement is supported. References: 1. 	Tripathi S, Shirnekhi HK, Gorman SD, Chandra B, Baggett DW, Park C-G, et al.

CRISPR gRNA vector wrongly including PAM sequence, the consequence should say ""gRNA plasmid becomes target of CRISPR cleavage"" with the caveat that this would only be the case if the wrongly included PAM is followed by another PAM, which is not the case in many CRISPR plasmids such as the pX330 derived ones.  This would obviously affect cleaving at the target if its PAM is not followed by a second PAM. While some errors in the table are almost certainly errors in design (ex stop codons before a 2A sequence, mutations in ITRs, etc...) I'm curious why some of the other design ""errors"" are deemed errors.  For example, using CMV in AAV vectors can be a perfectly acceptable choice depending on the use of the virus, especially if it isn't intended for long term expression.  Likewise, use of ""unstable"" sequences in high copy plasmids can be a problem, however if those plasmids are maintained in bacteria that maintain plasmids at a low copy (Epi400, Stbl2, etc...), the replication origin of the plasmid becomes less relevant as the copy number becomes more dependent on the host strain.

Some of the claims are simply wrong (e.g. the description of civil marriage registration). Others are caricatures for rhetorical effect (e.g. ""14 cans of SPAM"" is not what the reference says). In general, the list of supposed ills in Okinawa today has no direct connection to the longevity of today's 100-or-so-year-olds. I hope that the author can speak with people in Okinawa and perhaps reconsider this approach.",2024-07-10T03:40:12,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,,,,
