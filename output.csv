Conceptually prediction errors can (and probably should) be classified by the type of prediction they violate. The oddball paradigm used here probes for prediction errors driven by a deviation from a stimulus history pattern (i.e. stimulus history prediction errors) – with this slight increase in precision in terminology, it becomes clear that the current pitch of the paper is somewhat circular “Stimulus history, not expectation, drives stimulus history prediction errors in mammalian cortex”.

By conducting a transcriptomic analysis of plants with varying levels of tolerance to Cd and Hg, the study identified tissue-specific, genotype-specific, and metal-specific gene expression patterns. Notably, plants inoculated with mercury-tolerant rhizobia strains carrying a mercury reductase (Mer) operon experienced less reduction in nodule number, plant biomass, and iron distribution under Hg stress. This suggests that Hg-tolerant rhizobia can mitigate Hg toxicity in plants, enhancing resilience in contaminated environments. These findings highlight the potential to optimize legume-rhizobia interactions for improving plant tolerance to heavy metals and reducing heavy metal transport to edible parts of the plant, which is critical for food safety.",2024-10-08T19:41:38,disqus_esZHcfuXVr,Reena Sharma,10.1101/2024.10.06.616885,Plant genotype and microbial strain combinations strongly influence the transcriptome under heavy metal stress conditions,"Reena Sharma, Sanhita Chakraborty, Aditi Bhat, Michael Clear, Meng Xie, José J.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.01.543231v1#comment-6565996461,biorxivstage,2,"This comment is based on the version of the article published by Cell. I have concerns about the validity of the cryoEM result presented in this paper. The authors claim they obtained “a structure of the NINJ1 segment at 4.3 Å”. At this resolution, the following features should be clearly resolved in a cryoEM map of a protein containing alpha helices: •	The pitch of alpha helices (~5.5 Å) •	Large amino acid side residue side chains (e.g. Phe or Tyr, of which there are several in Ninj1) Neither of these features are demonstrated in the figures prepared by the authors. Figure panels S2D and E are consistent with a resolution of ~ 8-10 Å, where alpha helices are resolved as tubular features. No regular indentation or ridging corresponding to the helical pitch is apparent in the figures, or upon visual inspection of the deposited map ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/EMD-42301). No features corresponding to Phe or Tyr side chains are visible. At the resolution claimed by the authors, features corresponding to the side chains of residues Phe100, Phe117, Phe127 and Phe135, which are all located in alpha-helical segments (not in loops), would be expected to be resolved in the map, but they are not. In my view, based on this map inspection the authors should not have made this resolution claim. To support their resolution claim, the authors present Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curves from the cryoSPARC software in Figure S2C. While the FSC curve shown by the authors does cross the 0.143 threshold at ~4.3 Å, the FSC curve exhibits pathologies, which should have alerted the authors to the possibility that the 4.3 Å resolution estimate may be unreliable and that the map should be interpreted with caution. Most notably the curve starts dropping off at around 15 Å, indicating that the signal-to-noise ratio in the map is significantly deteriorated at resolution of ~15 Å and beyond. After completion of 3D refinement, cryoSPARC also outputs a second FSC figure, which includes an additional curve (“Corrected”), which accounts for effects of masking on resolution estimation by the FSC. It is unfortunate that the authors didn’t include this in their manuscript. The most likely explanation for this pathological FSC resolution estimate and its mismatch with the features resolved in the map is that the 3D refinement failed (due to high noise, or preferred orientation, or other pathologies in the dataset or in the refinement parameters), leading to overfitting to a local minimum in the scoring function. Indeed, the validation report for the deposited map and PDB (EMDB: 42301; PDB: 8UIP; https://files.rcsb.org/pub/pdb/validation_reports/ui/8uip/8uip_full_validation.pdf) contains evidence of overfitting during refinement. The orthogonal projections of the raw map (Section 6.1.2 of the validation report) show overfitting artefacts, as do the orthogonal standard deviation projections in false color of the raw map (Section 6.4.2). Such overfitting causes artifically inflated FSC values, which may help explain why the FSC-based estimate of resolution was wrong in this case. Given a map of this quality, it’s unclear how the authors built an atomic model of Ninj1. In that respect, the publication’s methods section is not detailed enough. Table S2 indicates that the authors started from a computational structure prediction from AlphaFold2. Given the lack of any features in the map to help place any residue side chains, I assume the location of key residues mentioned in the paper originated from this computational prediction rather than from the cryoEM result itself. The lack of support for the modeled atomic coordinates from cryoEM is also made evident in the EMDB/PDB validation report by the unusually poor Q and atom inclusion scores for a map/model of the claimed resolution. A Q-score of 0.04 is unusually low and shows very little map-to-model fit. These metrics, together with a visual inspection of the map and model as deposited, suggests that a significant fraction of the sequence was built outside the map and that the cryoEM result does not support the authors’ atomic model beyond the general shape and relative orientation of parts of the alpha-helical segments. The positioning of individual amino acid residues is not directly specified by the cryoEM result and may have come mostly from the AlphaFold model the authors used as a starting point. Note: the above observations should be not be taken as having any bearing on other key cryoEM-based observations in the paper, such as the curvatures of Ninj1 assemblies, which are supported by two-dimensional class averages of cryoEM images and not affected by overfitting in the later 3D refinement process.",2024-10-08T00:33:10,alexisrohou,Alexis Rohou,10.1101/2023.06.01.543231,NINJ1 mediates plasma membrane rupture through formation of nanodisc-like rings,"Liron David, Jazlyn P Borges, L.

In the Introduction, you note that one drawback of RFDiffusion/MPNN-based pipelines is the need to screen thousands to tens of thousands of designs in silico before finding the 10-100 that pass the quality metrics and can be tested experimentally with good success rates. Does BindCraft also require screening of thousands to tens of thousands of designs, or is it more efficient in silico than an RFDiffusion pipeline? You mention in the paper that BindCraft outputs statistics from each design run, and that biasing away from alpha helical binders reduces the in silico design success rate; so it sounds like you have the statistics ready to hand, at least for the targets reported in the paper. I’d love to see these design success rates added to a table, either in the main paper or the SI. Another thing I’d like to see is some quantification of the compute time and cost required to run the 4-step pipeline until 100 designs pass the in silico filters. I understand this cost scales with target/binder size and target difficulty, but I would imagine you have the data required to calculate these metrics at least for the design campaigns reported in the paper. I saw on Twitter that you’re working on a direct BindCraft / RFDiffusion pipeline comparison; I hope you’ll include the computational hardware and total CPU/GPU time for each side of that design campaign.

Simply put: I know that low p-values require sufficient sampling, so do you, and so do readers of the paper."" This seems disingenuous. First, you were not replying to the incorrect phrasing of ""the highest p-values"" and ""elevated p-values"", but to ""better p-values"" In my response to your response, I was clearly referring to elevated relative risk, elevated signal in your heat map, elevated statistical signifigance. I did incorrectly say elevated p-values this time, and for that I apologize, but my points still stand. Whether or not people know that better p-values (lower values, higher statistical significance) come from more sampling is irrelevant. I was not addressing how people would interpret them. I was addressing what could be concluded from them: The highest signal for relative risk (and the lowest p-values for elevated relative risk) does not colocalize with the stalls selling wild animals. Lowering the resolution to just the south-west portion of the market broadens the scope to essentially being equivalent to saying it coincides with where they sampled. ""it's clear that you get the point that 'all viruses aren't equal' and are now moving the goalposts. That's a game you're going to have to play alone."" Au contraire, it's a game you must play alone. You are the one that spoke of different distributions depending on hosts (and transmission methods):""identical regardless of their hosts and modes of transmission,"" As the paper heavily focuses on the raccoon dog as a host (and statements to the lay media do as well), which is the same host, and has the same transmission method (respiratory). I used data that you yourself saw fit to present, to address ""goalposts"" that you set, so I don't understand this objection. Of course, all viruses aren't equal, but we have to make due with the data we have. If we move from different (proposed) hosts, to specifically CoVs: -then the data still clearly shows an association between bamboorat mt reads and bamboo rat cov reads. It also works pretty well for canineCoVs The data is even able to show a correlation between a CoV, and the predator of the CoV's host (snakes and rats) https://i.imgur.com/prBYydu.png Yet it can't show a correlation with SARS-CoV-2 and a proposed intermediate host, I find this strange. ""the way you interpret this is inappropriately ignoring sampling differences between January 1 and January 12. This is a mistake you introduce and is not in Bloom 2024."" I do not ignore them at all, which is why I specifically linked to Bloom's figure 1: https://academic.oup.com/view-large/figure/436646794/vead089f1.tif If we only look at January 12 (so no sampling differences to account for), then SARS-CoV-2 reads are orders of magnitude less abundant than other CoVs seen at the market. On the interactive plot ( https://jbloom.github.io/Huanan_market_samples_addtl_analysis/viral_counts.html), you have to play ""find the pixel"" to get the number of SARS-CoV-2 reads: *20 total from 12 January. In contrast: * 1207 Bamboo rat CoVs (>60x more reads) * 900 canine CoV HeB-G1 reads (45x more) * 551 canine CoV SD-F3 reads (27.5x more) * 319 Rabbit CoV HKU14 reads (16x more) Even the hedgehog viruses have more reads (44 and 45), 4.5x more reads (combined) Why is it that sampling the wildlife stalls was able to detect all these other CoVs in such great abundance, but SARS-CoV-2 barely registered? Isn't the hypothesis supposed to be intense transmission among traded animals kept in poor condiditions, close together in cages, enabling multiple spillovers into humans after many probing mutations/infections? There's no such evidence of that in these samples, just a few scattered reads consistent with shedding from humans passing by. For that matter, isn't the 1 Jaunary sampling less biased? sampling around where the first signs of human infection were noticed within the market? I notice that you and your co-authors did not touch on why it seems none of the wildlife vendors got sick, in contrast to previous market zoonoses (ie: 2002-2003 SARS outbreaks) "" 'even when stratifying by collection date, clear negative correlations still come up' -- sorry I have no idea what this means in context."" https://dictionary.cambridge.org/fr/dictionnaire/anglais/stratifying stratifying: ""to arrange the different parts of something in separate layers or groups"" As per above, and Bloom 2024, if you group the samples by collection date, even in the 12 January collection date group, it clearly doesn't correlate with the wildlife reads. "" you wrote, 'I see nothing new here,' yet then and now you are referencing quite a bit of analysis in our paper."" Allow me to be more precise: I see nothing new of significance here that supports a market origin. You can always do a new analysis, but it won't neccessarily tell us anything new: * We already knew where the stalls were that sold wildlife * We already knew that live wildlife was being sold and which species (Xiao 2021), - notably, this analysis doesn't establish which wildlife was sold live. * Heatmaps of relative risk, which pointed to the mahjong rooms and bathrooms more than any stalls selling wildlife had already been published. * We already knew that there was a lineage A sequence generated from a market sample So from the above, I am left wondering, what are the new conclusions or inferences that can be drawn from this analysis? To me the most interesting one is the source of the raccoon dogs: Xiao 2021 did not report it. The evidence presented here obviously points to them being locally caught, but you and your co-authors did not seem to assign any significance to this. Instead, there is a statement to the effect that the full geographic range of these SNPs is unknown, leaving it uncertain where the raccoon dogs come from, ending up in an identical scenario to that of Xiao 2021, which also leaves the source of the raccoon dogs unknown. So yes, there is more analysis here, but I don't see that it helps answer any questions, or when it does (raccoon dog source), this is dismissed. ""You're also free to flesh out your 'mahjong/bathrooms' origins theory"" I have proposed no such theory of the origin. I am simply stating the fact that the heat maps produced from this data using your parameters show higher elevated risk (and higher statistical significance to that elevated risk) around those locations than around the stalls where wildlife was present. This fact suggests that the heat maps reflect significant human to human transmission within the market, not the origin of the virus, at the time it was sampled. That is not a theory on origin, just an interpretation of the heat maps. I would add that it also suggests that circulation among wildlife at the virus prior to the market closing (exact time period unclear) was low at best - which is also somewhat surprising given that we have seen plenty of cases of human to animal transmission of SARs-CoV-2 (deer, mink farms, domestic animals, zoo animals, etc), which may argue against any significant susceptibility of the animals t0 the pre-D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2.",2024-10-07T08:22:46,disqus_25ZToSOvrx,Ema Nymton,10.1101/2023.09.13.557637,Genetic tracing of market wildlife and viruses at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Alexander Crits-Christoph, Joshua I.

Behavioral regulation by enteric neurons is poorly understood and this manuscript address this gap by comprehensively characterizing the functions of Gr43a expressing enteric neurons using multiple approaches. We were particularly impressed by the assay developed and used in Figure 6 to monitor sucrose transit through the gut as well as the technically challenging imaging of enteric neurons. Overall, this manuscript is a major addition to the growing body of work on enteric neurons (see other recent articles on enteric neurons here: https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-024-01020-z and https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2866-8). The figures are excellent and nicely complement the streamlined manuscript. We have very few minor suggestions that the authors could choose to address during their revisions. •	Figure 3H and I: While the XZ plane convincingly shows that Gr43a neurons innervate the foregut lumen, it is difficult to decipher the differences in anatomy between the two classes. Stochastic labelling techniques such as MultiColor FlpOut could assist in visualizing the morphological differences between the two sets of neurons. •	Figure 4B: It is not clear to the readers why the response with EN-3 was statistically significant but the response EN-4 wasn’t. We did not observe any drastic differences in the two responses in Extended data Figure 4. Besides this one question that would be worth addressing is whether Gr43a is required in these neurons for the response to sugar or other gustatory receptors (if expressed) in these neurons mediate the response. Perhaps something to address in the future.

I tried to accurately portray your argument, but it is impossible to continue to do so when you write ""the highest p-values"" and ""elevated p-values."" Simply put: I know that low p-values require sufficient sampling, so do you, and so do readers of the paper. The data is public. You're free to publish an alternative analysis. 2. Your previous comment was about ""CoVs definitively associated"" and now you post a picture of the distribution of an amdoparvovirus; it's clear that you get the point that ""all viruses aren't equal"" and are now moving the goalposts. That's a game you're going to have to play alone. 3. One reason for the differences between ""all dates"" and ""Jan-12-2020"" in Bloom 2024 is the same reason for the artifactual correlations in Bloom 2023 regarding the same data: the way you interpret this is inappropriately ignoring sampling differences between January 1 and January 12.

Lastly, you're entitled to your opinion on the rest of this.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.12.607533v2#comment-6563744659,biorxivstage,3,"We read this paper as part of a journal club, and have decided to compile a collective review and publicly share it with the authors. This was inspired by the Arcadia Science Preprint Review Pizza Party Initiative, and this represents our fourth preprint review. Ji et al. present a transformer-based foundation model, called Prophet, which stands for Predictor of Phenotypes. The authors train Prophet on a variety of data modalities including gene expression, cell viability, chemical structures, and cell morphology using publicly-available sources. The authors should be commended for using such vast and disparate resources for such an innovative approach. The task of Prophet is to predict assay endpoints, such as cell viability, and to learn a useful embedding space which can be mined to identify novel, and potentially impactful, relationships. Most often, the phenotype prediction is in the context of some form of perturbation. The authors present a variety of benchmarks comparing Prophet to other methods, and they present both in vitro and in vivo applications to demonstrate potential use-cases. The applications range from looking up untested compounds that are similar to clinically-relevant compounds and predicting zebrafish cell type proportions after gene knockout. Overall, Prophet is methodologically interesting and the applications demonstrate that the method may help generate hypotheses at a low cost. However, we have several major and minor concerns mostly to do with clarity, performance, and software. Major concerns: 1. Unclear and inconsistent terminology and definitions. a. It is unclear exactly what the authors mean by “phenotype”. It seems that sometimes the term is being used interchangeably with prediction/output but other times it is being used to describe observable physical properties. Additionally, the authors refer to gene expression as a phenotype, and, while technically true, it could be confusing given the authors are also using cell morphology as a phenotype. Furthermore, it is unclear if the authors are describing the collection of genes in the gene expression vector, for example, as the phenotype, or, if it is just a single gene. This confusion is also related to our confusion about model outputs (whether the output is a single element or a vector representation; see below). Given the word is in the article’s title, it seems particularly important. b. The terminology of “experiments” is also unclear. The authors claim to use 4.7 million experiments, but does this refer to plates, conditions, samples, something else? How did the authors calculate this count? c. At times, it is unclear what format the input data are and at what level of processing. What are the different possibilities of input data and how might a user decide which to use? Can a user input multiple kinds of data? Did the authors apply any sort of post-processing or quality control? d. The output of Prophet is ambiguous. Does Prophet predict a single value per input (or different inputs), or, does it predict a cell state vector? The authors describe outputting a one-hot encoding. Does this refer to the output phenotype? What is this structure? The authors write: “we train Prophet to predict cell viability, compound IC50, Cell Painting morphology features, mRNA transcript abundance, and cell type proportion.” Does this mean Prophet will output all of these predictions if the data you have is only morphology features? Does a user have control over these decisions? Furthermore, the authors write ""Prophet’s transfer learning capability is not limited to phenotypes seen during the pre-training stage. We did not pre-train Prophet on any morphological measurement, but Prophet fine-tuned on JUMP outperformed both the Prophet-individual model trained only on JUMP and the baseline (Fig. 2b).” What is being predicted from the JUMP data? Morphology feature profiles? Images? Drug class or MOA? This needs to be expanded upon to make these claims. Please clarify the output structure and how a user will interact with the output. Figure 1C does not make this clear. e. Critical methodological details are discussed without sufficient detail. For example, the data split and validation strategies were ambiguous. How were training, test, and validation splits handled? What partitioning methods, if any, were used? The three-fold cross-validation procedure also lacked clarity. Were all datasets used in cross-validation? How did individual data-set models training differ and influence the full model fine-tuning? What is the specific pseudobulking procedure for RNA? 2. Unclear justification for Prophet architecture decisions a. The authors present table S3, which provides hyperparameters. How are these justified? For example, the choice of GeLU over alternatives like ReLU or SiLU. Why use an embedding dimension of 512? Were alternative configurations explored? How would modifying individual architecture decisions impact performance? b. 20.1 M parameters is a fairly small transformer, will this model need to grow as more perturbations or data types are added? In other words, how long will this model be foundational until the next best model is released? c. Encoders sequentially relate inputs with a positional embedding. Does this architecture use a positional embedding in the encoder? What does the position represent? 3. Concerns about model comparisons, baselines, and performance a. The authors compare Prophet to much simpler machine learning models (random forest, MLP, linear regression), individual Prophet models (trained using only one modality), and a mean baseline representing the average value of that intervention. The authors write: “This approach follows the same strategy as current foundation models (19, 36, 37), which are pre-trained on large amounts of data and then fine-tuned for specific datasets using the pre-trained model as a backbone.” Why not use these current foundation models as benchmarks for Prophet? The authors should also consider comparing different transformer architectures and non-transformer models (e.g., state-space models) as well. b. Prophet’s performance is low. The highest R2 value is 0.27 with a low of -0.03 and many predictions that perform the same as the mean baseline. Given the low, variable performance, it is difficult to trust Prophet’s output, or, at best, understand which outputs may have incorrect predictions. The authors claim an R2 improvement as low as 0.04 represents a 13x increase in number of hits, but it is unclear how the authors calculate this value. The authors also claim Prophet reduces “the number of experiments needed for viability screens by at least 60x” What statistics are calculating this estimate? c. The ML model comparisons compared to baseline are incredibly low. Results in Figure 2B suggest that the mean is a better predictor than nearly 100% of ML-based predictions (mean baseline is better in 41/45 comparisons). Our guess is that something might be going wrong in the model training or evaluation procedures. d. It is confusing if there is only one “final” Prophet model or if there are multiple “final” Prophet models since each must be fine-tuned to single datasets. Why not fine-tune on all datasets? Figure 2A suggests that for each time you perform inference in a new data category (e.g., cell morphology vs. gene expression), fine-tuning is required? If so, this strategy will lead to variable predictions and perhaps unexpected results and this is not a foundational model, but, at best, a foundational architecture. e. The authors performed a critical analysis, in which they restricted the amount of training data by 50%, 30%, 20%, 10%, and 5%. The authors state: “We found a clear trend: the more treatments and cell states seen by Prophet, the higher the confidence in the predictions (Fig. 2g).” This is an expected result, however, it is unclear how Figure 2G supports this statement. What is an “axis holdout”? Standard deviation of R2 for which predictions? What do the different points represent? How does this show confidence? 4. Concerns about limited discussion of technical artifacts a. The authors mention technical variation in the limitations section, but this should be elaborated upon. How might Prophet’s performance be impacted by technical artifacts? b. Earlier in the manuscript, the authors write: “We universally decompose each experiment into a unique combination of three fundamental elements—the cellular state, the treatments being performed, and the intended phenotypic readout.” Signals from technical artifacts are likely a fourth fundamental element, or, at the least, there should be an experiment to test the impact of technical artifacts. 5. Concerns about publicly-available source code on Github a. We provide a full GitHub review following our manuscript review below. Minor concerns - Pg. 3 ln 5, the authors write: “To train it, we collected 9 perturbational datasets to create the largest compendium of publicly available screening datasets to date:...” The language suggests that these datasets were all collected by this group, but the datasets are all publicly available. Also, the Figure S1 reference probably should point to Figure S2. JUMP is listed three times in Figure S2 (one for compound, one for genetic treatment, and then one for both) Why is it listed for both when it is already split into the two perturbation types? Also, the right subplot in S2B (the complexity trade-off) is a bit misleading. JUMP has far higher complexity than PRISM, for instance, but this graph would suggest otherwise. Perhaps the missing piece not described here is readout complexity? - Figure 1B is a bit difficult to understand. For example, the bullet points for the “intervention” box don’t seem like interventions? It seems like these should be listed elsewhere or the heading should be changed. How is a “gene sequence embedding” an intervention data transformation? - The authors should tamp down claims. For example, the authors write “We did not pre-train Prophet on any morphological measurement, but Prophet fine-tuned on JUMP outperformed both the Prophet-individual model trained only on JUMP and the baseline”. The performance is only marginally improved (0.01). The authors retrained the zebrafish Prophet model, but it would be helpful to see performance for the original prophet model applied. - What is a pre-built plate? “To do so, we used a setup with existing pre-built 384-well plates, each with 352 unique drug perturbations applied to 9 cancer cell lines (Table S9). In total, there were 16 pre-built plates.” GitHub comments and concerns 1. Documentation and Usability a. The README provided by the author is well-structured, offering clear instructions on installation, usage, and licensing, which provides a strong starting point for using Prophet. This level of clarity is especially valuable for researchers and users who are new to the tool. b. While the README provides a good overview, the documentation around model training is sparse. It would be beneficial to include an explanation in the README on how the model was trained and provide a small explanation of the embeddings captured. More detailed usage/inference examples would enhance comprehension.  It’s also unclear how users can apply the method to their own datasets. This will offer quick and easy access for users to understand the functionality and purpose of Prophet. c. Commented-out code and TODOs are scattered throughout the scripts. Best practices suggest removing unused code to reduce clutter and confusion. Example: prophet/ http://model.py #L12. 2. Software Environment and Dependencies a. Users may face reproducibility challenges when trying to set up the software, particularly due to missing environment isolation. Creating an isolated Conda environment or improving instructions around environment setup would help ensure users avoid dependency conflicts. b. The project uses an older version of Pandas (1.5.x), despite newer versions being available with important fixes. Updating the Pandas version would improve compatibility and performance. c. A http://setup.py and requirements.txt are both provided but are not used together, creating confusion over proper environment management. d. No Python version range is specified in the http://setup.py, which led to issues with earlier Python versions (3.8, 3.9). Python 3.10 worked, but this should be clarified for future users. e. The provided notebook requires a specific version of NumPy that differs from what is stated in http://setup.py. Errors occur with newer versions. NumPy 1.24.4 was found to work, but this should be addressed in the dependencies. f. We were able to install it into a Linux machine. However, an error occurs when attempting to install the software on macOS. The error reports: “ERROR: No matching distribution found for scipy==1.14.0” g. A Jupyter notebook is included, but Jupyter is not listed as a dependency in the http://setup.py or requirements.txt, which prevents seamless execution within the provided environment. 3. Other comments a. The repository does not include any software tests or automated testing via GitHub Actions or similar tools. Incorporating automated testing would help validate the code’s functionality and improve its robustness. b. The code does not pass several linting checks (e.g., through dslinter), highlighting the need for improved code quality and adherence to data science best practices. c. The repository lacks key community health files like http://CONTRIBUTING.md and http://CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, which are important for guiding open-source contributions and user interactions. d. Data provided in .xlsx format (e.g., via Figshare) can cause formatting errors and is less open-access friendly than formats like .csv. Switching to a more stable format would improve accessibility and avoid errors. e. In the tutorial notebook, the code blocks are not executed in a sequential order, which can lead to potential bugs. This lack of sequential execution means that changes made in earlier cells may not be reflected in subsequent cells, resulting in inconsistencies or errors in functionality. 4. Recommendations for Improvement a. Address installation issues: Fixing the bugs related to installation and setup should be a priority, as they could deter users from exploring Prophet further. Ensuring an isolated environment setup (e.g., using Conda) would help resolve these issues. b. Enforce version control for dependencies: Better organization of http://setup.py and requirements.txt, as well as enforcing version control for dependencies, would enhance reliability. c. Expand the README: Adding a table of contents, additional usage examples, and sections on contributing guidelines and testing procedures would make the README more comprehensive. d. Adopt best software practices: Implementing clear setup instructions, enforcing dependency version control, and organizing the code more effectively would increase usability and accessibility for a wider scientific audience.

The rationale behind that choice is not clearly explained, most of the references used in the Introduction and Discussion sections to explain the effect of time since planting on functional groups come from soil studies rather than rhizosphere studies. The term “field age” is also misleading as it suggests that bulk soil was sampled, and other terms such as “plant age” could maybe be considered. 2) There were no replicates per field age, as only one field per age was considered, although we understand that different plots were sampled per field. Other parameters than “field age” could cause the observed effects on fungal functional guilds, such as differences in soil nutrients between fields, for example. As seen in the PCoA, fields C and D (both classified as “old fields”) are different in terms of fungal community structure. Including replicate fields would have allowed to avoid possible confounding effects. 3) Important details are missing from the field description. Considering the Discussion on the possible effects of fertilization and fungicide applications, information should be added on the agrochemical management of these plots. Was it similar across fields? Across sampling years? Information regarding the soil nutrient status, and possible climatic variations between the two years of sampling, should also be included. 4) Methodological bias was also discussed. For example, most fungal taxa identified with the UNITE database would not be able to be assigned to a functional guild. How did you account for these taxa that could not be included into a functional category? Another possible bias that was discussed is the fact that relative abundance data may not represent what is actually occurring in the rhizosphere: absolute abundance data would also be needed and should be used for the implementation of microbial networks. 5) The discussion could also benefit from adding some consideration on the “functional group” categorization. How categorical is a “functional group”? Mortierella for example is listed as a saprotroph but it can also act as a plant pathogen. Mycorrhizal fungi included both EMF and AMF, yet strawberry only form symbiosis with AMF. As the focus of this study is on strawberry rhizosphere, why not discuss possible strawberry pathogens and symbionts? 6) An effect of plant genotype was not detected on relative abundance nor richness of fungal functional guilds. However, significant effects may be found in terms of taxa composition. Why not include such analysis in the study? Other minor comments are enlisted below. Abstract Results seem to report differences in soil fungi rather than rhizosphere fungi. Why the focus on rhizosphere and not bulk soil? Plant genotype is not mentioned in the Results either, yet it was mentioned in the Background section as an important determinant of microbiomes. Introduction L50: “The essential functions of soil microbiomes, such as pathogenesis, mutualism, and decomposition…”. Is pathogenesis a function? Functions of the soil microbiomes could rather include maintenance of soil structure, fertility, plant productivity… L66: Research gap: “Despite their significance, our knowledge of the dynamics of different fungal functional groups that co-exist in rhizosphere soil microbiomes is limited (Zanne et al. 2020; Martinović et al. 2021)”. The importance of filling this research gap is not clearly explained. L69: “Soil fungal functional groups can be dynamic in the plant rhizosphere. For example, fungal pathogens can accumulate over time, especially in monocultures or ecosystems with low plant species diversity (Cook 2006; Li et al. 2014; Peralta et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2023a)”. These references are for soil, not rhizosphere. Second paragraph of the Introduction: mostly on soil build-up of pathogens, and possible decrease of AMF over time. But this section seems to address the effect of long-term cropping, not plant age (rhizosphere). The rationale behind the selection of rhizosphere as the soil compartment to be studied is needed. You may want to check paper by Sun et al. (2022), published in Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, on the dynamics of fungal functional guilds in the rhizosphere of wheat. Methods Why establish and sample plots (20 x 20 cm) and not plants if rhizosphere soil was considered? Is there only 1 plant per plot (i.e. 3 plants sampled per genotype and field age)? It is unclear. Were the same plants sampled in 2021 and 2022? If not, a plant effect could be observed between both years. Results L205: The increase in pathogens in the older fields is observed for one sampling year only (the pattern does not hold in 2022), yet it is described (and discussed) as a general finding. What happened in 2022 with AMF that decreased dramatically in all fields (both in relative abundance and in richness)? It is briefly discussed as possibly caused by the fertilization regime, which is not described. Differences in community composition could be assessed statistically to test for significant differences in taxon relative abundance between fields or sampling years. Regarding your Figures, stating the age of the field in the “x” axis rather than letters “A”, “B”, etc., could be more informative. Discussion The discussion on the accumulation of pathogens over time is also based on references on soil microbiomes, not rhizosphere microbiomes. Were the same plants sampled in 2021 and 2022? L301: fungicide applications are mentioned to explain the “levelling off” of pathogens in older fields (C and D). Any data on application rates and application dates? This is important if fungal communities are studied. How specific were these agrochemicals? How were they applied? L311-312: Fusarium is a large genus with many species, not all are pathogens. Making inferences such as “the causal agent of Fusarium wilt in strawberry” is a bit far-stretched. Which Fusarium species are actual strawberry pathogens? The whole discussion regarding the potential accumulation of pathogens in the rhizosphere calls for symptom incidence data. It is something that was measured? L387: “the similarity in fungal functional groups across genotypes observed in this study may indicate functional redundancies and stable essential functions of microbiomes.” The microbiome was not studied and differences may be reflected in bacterial communities rather than fungal ones.",2024-10-02T09:06:19,frdriquereverchon,Frédérique Reverchon,10.1101/2024.08.30.610541,Contrasting dynamics of soil fungal functional groups in the plant rhizosphere,"Na Wei, Madelynn Nakaji-Conley",2024-09-02

First, the authors showed that iPSCs could efficiently differentiate into pericyte-like cells, express pericyte specific markers, and promote angiogenesis, barrier integrity and contractility. They then investigated the differences between iPLCs derived from healthy individuals and those derived from AD patients carrying APPswe mutations. Compared to controls, APPswe iPLCs exhibited a distinct expression of pericyte markers, were able to secrete amyloid beta 1-40 and 1-42 within the media, had an altered transcriptome for key genes involved in cytoskeleton reorganization and metabolic regulation, were more sensitive to mediators of inflammation, and showed compromised angiogenesis, barrier integrity and hypercontractility. Overall, the manuscript uses a novel approach (iPLCs) to investigate an interesting and sometimes overlooked topic - the specific contribution of pericytes to AD pathology and vascular disfunction. Previous work conducted in in vitro BBB models showed that pericytes play a key role in amyloid clearance contributing to the removal of aggregated Aβ from brain capillaries (Ma et al, Mol Neurodegeneration 13, 57 (2018) and Blanchard et al, Nat Med. 2020 Jun;26(6):952-963). Here, the authors focus on the contribution of pericytes in amyloid secretion, emphasizing the novelty of their research. However, the high variability within datasets and the small number of replicates raises some concern. Major comments •	The statement “…overproduce beta-amyloid” in the manuscript title suggests that pericytes have a significant role in Aβ production. Although the authors showed that APPswe iPLCs could secrete 10 times more Aβ1-42 than the control cells, the Aβ1-42 levels are 100 times lower than neurons. Thus, the authors concluded that “contribution of pericytes to total brain amyloid load in AD is limited”. The title should be changed to indicate the main findings of the work and should be supported by the data presented. •	APPswe iPLCs were derive from 3 donors versus iPLCs from 7 healthy controls. Importantly, among the donors, only one had AD, while the others had pre-symptomatic AD or no symptomatology (in this case the mutation was introduced using CRISPR-Cas9 as reported in the methods). The variability in AD cases plus the differences in symptomatology may skew the results and may contribute to the high variability shown in several graphs (Figure 2 A, B, C, F, J). Figures •	The authors should be consistent in the number of replicates used: different groups in the graphs show only 1 or 2 replicates, even for control cell lines, which makes the reader question the reproducibility and accuracy of their findings (see Figures 1B, 1I, 1K, 2H, 2J, 4E). •	The authors should clarify the findings reported in Figures 2E and 2H: the figures are similar, but it is not clear if iPLCs in 2H derive from APPswe iPLCs (as reported in the figure legend) or control. •	The authors should correct Figures 1A and 2I as sample labels are missing. The authors should also modify the arrows used in Figure 2I and 2D as it is not clear to what they are pointing. Scale bars should be added on both images since they show different magnification. •	Figures should be arranged in a consistent manner e.g., same format and order should be used consistently. Discussion •	An interesting finding is that the HIF1a pathway is downregulated in APPswe iPLCs (Figure 3B). The authors should mention this finding in the discussion. This finding could also support the fact that APPswe cells have decreased VEGF levels and impaired angiogenesis and no change in BACE1 levels (as VEGF and BACE1 are HIF1a target genes). •	For future experiments, the authors should discuss whether APPswe iPLCs exhibit differences in oxidative stress, ROS production and mitochondrial activity compared to controls. •	For future experiments, the authors should use cell lines and human-derived cells as models as they may reveal differences from iPLCs. Minor comments •	The authors measured the changes in expression of several pericytes associated genes in Figure 1. However, it is not clear why the authors were not consistent with these specific genes for their further analysis. For example, in Figure 1B they measured PDGFRB, DES, LAMA2, DLC1, and PDE7B while in 1C they measured LAMA2, PDE7B, DES, omitting PDGFRB but adding genes ACTA2 and CD248. Then, all genes were analyzed in Figure 2A-B. Thus, the authors should provide change in expression data for all genes (PDGFRB, LAMA2, DLC1, CD248, PDE7B, ACTA2, DES) in 1B and 1C or provide reasoning for leaving some out. •	Please correct the repeated sentences on page 5: “…which are known to express detectable levels of LRP121 (Figure 2 J). Furthermore, when iPLCs were subjected to pHrodo-conjugated zymosan-coated beads, no uptake of these pathogen-mimicking particles was observed (data not shown). Thus, it appears that the phagocytic activity of these iPLCs is low.” •	Additional edits for word choice and sentence construction are also needed, e.g., pg 10, 2nd to last paragraph, 2nd to last sentence is awkward. Decision for the editor: Major revisions The manuscript presents a novel idea that could advance the AD/CAA field but, at this stage, I have several major concerns regarding reproducibility and possible accuracy of the described findings.

The authors used a SIEMENS WIP sequence of segmented 3D-EPI at a Terra scanner with 0.8mm isotropic resolution during a finger tapping task to see if they can detect previously reported activation in the upper and deeper layer of human M1. The study combines advanced hardware (novel 7T) with advanced sequences (segmented 3D-EPI) and advanced processing (phase-based QSM and laminar signal pooling). Each step is of interest to the MRM readership. The study is overall well described. And the study design is clear. I believe that every design choice is justified and relevant for the overall research question: feasibility of laminar fQSM. In the emerging field of layer-fMRI, there is a big research focus on finding acquisition and analysis methods with the best compromise of sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility. There are about 70 papers about this topic published already. The manuscript at hands augments this literature with a modern set of tools and innovative combination of established methods. The layer results are a bit messy. Layer profiles in Figs. 4 and 6 look quite noisy. This is partly expected for the ambitiously accelerated protocols used here (GRAPPA 6 and 12). The results are consistent enough to claim “feasibility of fQSM”. No group average layer profiles are shown (unclear if group results would be clearer?!?). I recommend the publication of this manuscript with a few small suggestions of revisions to be considered. I list them below: 1.) It is not really clear to me how the M1 ROI was selected. Some previous studies exclusively focused the analysis on the evolutionary older part of M1 (BA4a). (e.g. outlined here: https://layerfmri.com/2018/03/13/finding-roi-of-the-double-layers-in-m1/). Maybe the authors can state how they defined their ROIs? 2.) It is not trivial to obtain interpretable phase data with EPI. given that the authors use CAIPI field of view shifting, they must use the icepat reconstruction from SIEMENS. This framework does not allow saving RF channels uncombined. So it might be helpful to the reader if the authors can state which coil combination method was used? Some of the default EPI Nyquist phase correction methods calibrate the global phase on a TR by TR basis. This would make it harder to interpret functional phase changes. Maybe the authors can mention in the manuscript, which phase correction was used. 3.)  For some of the protocols, Partial Fourier was applied in two directions. This is surprising to me. In my understanding, partial Frontier imaging is based on the assumption that when the image is real (no imaginary part), k-space is point-symmetric. This can be helpful to obtain magnitude data in Partial Fourier without much loss in resolution. But I am not sure if this also applies to phase data. Doing partial Fourier with phase imaging sounds like reconstructing a phase with an algorithm that assumes that there is no phase in the first place. Doing additional partial Fourier in the second phase encoding direction is even more surprising to me. The k-space symmetry is a point symmetry, not an axis symmetry. This means that doing a double partial Fourier results in complete loss of high resolution information in two diagonal directions. Maybe I am misunderstanding something. If authors agree with my worries, they could include a statement in the manuscript stating that their resolution might be affected by Partial Fourier imaging. Maybe they can state in the manuscript which partial Fourier algorithm was used? I believe POCS is not available in IcePat? 4.) The acquisition protocol is relatively ambitious. With extremely large coverage (80-212 slices) and high acceleration factors (GRAPPA 6-12). In the field of layer-fMRI, there are currently only first cautious attempts in the field to get towards whole-brain imaging. But due to the high noise level of these protocols, whole brain layer fmri required up to 51 runs (e.g. see Kenshu dataset). Here, the acquisition protocol is covering large parts of the brain, while ‘only’ activating the sensory motor system. This means that the feasibility test investigated here refers to a worst case scenario for generalizable acquisition protocols. For more tailored, brain-area-specific protocols with smaller FOV and with less required acceleration, and shorter TRs, the results might be even more robust. 5) Stylistic comment: Figures 1,3,5,6 use the term “fMRI” as GE-BOLD. I think this could be confusing. Technically fQSM and VASO are also fMRI. Similarly in Tab. 1 BOLD is referred to at 3D-EPI, whoever VASO is also using 3D-EPI. The authors could consider referring to it as BOLD/fQSM?",2024-09-30T15:48:21,renzohuber,Renzo Huber,10.1101/2024.09.16.613070,Feasibility of laminar functional quantitative susceptibility mapping,"Sina Straub, Xiangzhi Zhou, Shengzhen Tao, Erin M.

I note that it also does not address the points raised in Bloom 2024. It only tangentially addresses 2 points in my post, both of which are apparently misconstrued. The first point that was addressed was about the p-values- however this response did not acurately portray the argument. My post never said it was misleading, but rather that the sampling bias towards the stalls would concentrate the highest p-values near the stalls, even more so than a simple relative-risk heatmap would, making the result of elevated p-values near the stalls expected whether or not the stalls were the origin of the outbreak. Compare: https://i.imgur.com/iDD6D93.jpeg to https://i.imgur.com/2YmYlZp.png The second point ""an argument that implicitly assumes all expectations for all coronaviruses are identical regardless of their hosts and modes of transmission,"" No, it does not assume they are ""identical"", but rather that there are general similarities. I am asking for an explanation why the distribution is so different. Neither mode of transmission nor host explain this - nor does date of sampling. While not explicitly stated, there is a substantial focus on Raccoon dogs. You show the distribution of a virus with the same putative host (Raccoon dogs) and same transmission methods (respiratory). The distributions are strikingly different. Compare https://i.imgur.com/iDD6D93.jpeg to https://i.imgur.com/OFXpCIf.jpeg This paper argued (in preprint), and it still argues )in final published form) that the 12 Jan RNA had more time to decay. Considering the market was closed at the same time, why did the SARS-CoV-2 reads decay to such lower values than other CoVs in samples from the same dates, and within the same samples, as shown by Bloom? See here: https://i.imgur.com/kIOTTYq.jpeg -even when stratifying by collection date, clear negative correlations still come up. Overall, I find that a lot of speculation is offered, but it comes accross as excuses for the data not actually showing that the virus originated from the wildlife stalls. I'll also raise additional critiques now: 1) The heat maps do not colocalize with the potential hosts: SARS-CoV-2 (RR p-values) and Raccoon dog reads shown here: https://i.imgur.com/AyAiag9.jpeg In the paper, instead the focus is on the south-west portion of the market. As I see it, there are two possibilities: i) The analysis DOES have sufficient resolution: in which case the resulting heat map not co-localizing with the wildlife stalls would exonerate them ii) The analysis DOES NOT have sufficient resolution: in which case it must be noted that the eastern and northern parts of the market were very poorly sampled. In this case, finding more positive samples where more samples were taken does not allow any conclusions to be drawn. 2) The analysis of the SNPs of the Raccoon dogs clearly aligns with the the SNPs of locally caught wildlife (the C14859A + A15304G genome from Hubei, and the C14372T, C15102A, C15252A, T15306C genome from Hubei). Despite the evidence clearly pointing to locally caught raccoon dogs, speculation is offered (again) that maybe racoon dogs with these SNPs are found further south. Notably, Hubei (the local province) is not a plausible origin of the progenitor. Pekar seemingly agrees: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.12.548617v1 In essence, this paper shows: i) 3 lineage B sequences 1 low quality lineage A sequence have a (very very wide) tMRCA confidence interval that overlaps with a tMRCA calculated from many more A and B lineage genomes: hardly anything surprising or something that conclusions can be drawn from ii) Within the heavily sampled area of the market, the areas of elevated relative risk don't actually overlap with the locations of the wildlife stalls -There is just one stall on the periphery of an area of elevated risk, the one closest to the entrance/mah jong rooms/bathrooms, which is where the higest elevated risk is. iii) The raccoon dog genomes from that stall suggest that they are locally caught, and do not come from areas with potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2's precursors On balance, the sum of this evidence seems to suggest that the HSM wildlife stalls in general, and raccoon dogs specifically, were not the origin of this virus. Much speculation and many excuses are offered, but it must be reiterated that these excuses and speculation, not evidence. The correlation analysis of Bloom can point right to the hosts of other viruses. The heat maps produced for this paper can point right to the hosts of other viruses. SARS-CoV-2 continuously fails to produce evidence and associations that other animal viruses at the market produced. The way these findings are presented in the paper and to the general public through the media seems to be at odds with what the data actually shows.",2024-09-30T08:04:04,disqus_25ZToSOvrx,Ema Nymton,10.1101/2023.09.13.557637,Genetic tracing of market wildlife and viruses at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Alexander Crits-Christoph, Joshua I.

Not sure where to discuss after the paper was published, but wanted to add some insight regarding the endogenously purified Pks13 protein used for cryoEM, crosslinking mass spec, and LC-MS (for identification of endogenous lipid). As it's published at NSMB, the paper doesn't address the fact that the endogenously purified Pks13 used for the above mentioned experiments, using the same purification protocol each time, showed variable SEC traces. After a while, we could not reproduce the peak1 and peak2 peaks in SEC (shown in Extended data fig1), but the two peaks either overlapped, or peak1 essentially disappeared. Sometimes, other interacting proteins were also pulled down along with Pks13, which confounded the SEC traces. CryoEM was done with peak1 with TAM inhibitor added, while XL-MS and LC-MS were done with mixed peak1&2 species. Protein used for XL-MS also had ""contaminant"" species which could actually be functionally-relevant binding partner. Since these protein preps behaved differently in SEC, we are not sure about the functional ramifications of these proteins purified at different times.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.19.572389v1#comment-6556038787,biorxivstage,1,"Response from Andrew Savinov, Sebastian Swanson, Amy E. Keating, and Gene-Wei Li (MIT): We thank CJ San Felipe, Priyanka Bajaj, and James Fraser for their thoughtful review of our manuscript, “High-throughput computational discovery of inhibitory protein fragments with AlphaFold” ( bioRxiv 2023.12.19.572389). We were pleased the reviewers appreciated our contributions in predicting protein fragment binding modes. The major point the reviewers raise is uncertainty about how MSAs were treated in making the FragFold predictions. We now address this and several other points alongside extensive additions to this paper, including new high-throughput experimental data supporting the computationally predicted fragment binding models. Here we summarize our responses and changes in this revised manuscript, now available as Version 2 on bioRxiv . Throughout, we use bold text blocks to indicate our responses, and italic text blocks to indicate reviewer comments. From introductory comments and reviewers’ major point 1: The major strength of this paper is in developing a method that could be used to identify regions of proteins that are involved in PPI's based on evolutionarily related sequences that recapitulate the native binding interfaces. The major weakness of this paper is that the underlying method of MSA concatenation is not clearly explained (see Major point 1). Why is the discontinuous unpaired strategy optimal relative to other AlphaFold-multimer-like strategies? Overall, the paper demonstrates the power of AlphaFold to closely recapitulate the structures of experimentally determined fragment binding interfaces by working exclusively in sequence space in a high-throughput manner. Further, in the absence of experimental structures, the authors present plausible AlphaFold predictions of fragment bound structures that are supported by biochemical and genetic data which could further contribute to the utility of this method in studying known PPI's. Major points: 1) The authors state that they generated multiple sequence alignments for both the fragments and target protein prior to running AlphaFold2 to minimize computation time. Although it is not clearly explained, the authors claim they concatenated these two MSA's into a single MSA. We interpret this to mean that the input MSA's were not directly pairing the fragment sequences to the target sequences but leaving either side of the fragment sequence and the target sequence blank to force AlphaFold to co-predict the structure of the fragment with the target protein by treating it as a single discontinuous sequence. While we were surprised by the simplicity of this method and the ability to remain in sequence space based on evolutionary similarity of fragment and target protein sequences, there are several questions we have regarding this implementation From the explanation provided with figure 1A, the fragment sequence appears to be directly paired to the target sequence, however in fig 1B the method appears to work by using the evolutionary information of many orthologs and related proteins of both fragment and target to co-predict their structures using a discontinuous input sequence. Is this correct? Could the authors provide a clearer description of how they are concatenating the MSA's? We were also curious to know how different concatenation strategies affect the accuracy of predictions. For example, could the authors also try concatenating directly paired fragment-target sequences from the same species of origin (or even try this as a single continuous sequence)? If the sequences are continuous, does adding linker regions between the fragment and target alter the results? Does the order of concatenation affect the results (concatenating from the N or C-termini of the target?). We thank the reviewers for pointing out this potential point of confusion in our methodology. We have now revised the description of our methods in the Results, Figure 1, and the Materials and Methods to clarify what was done. No novel methods of MSA concatenation were developed in this work. Rather, protein-peptide binding predictions were run using the established approach natively implemented in the ColabFold version of AlphaFold2, in which multiple polypeptides are explicitly modeled as separate chains (Mirdita et al. , Nature Methods 2022). Likewise, multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of the separate protein partners (i.e., fragment and target protein) were concatenated, a standard input for ColabFold required for predicting interactions between multiple polypeptide chains. MSAs were concatenated in a strictly row-wise, unpaired fashion. Crucially, we note that while the MSAs are concatenated (as required by ColabFold), the sequences of the protein fragment and full-length protein polypeptide chains are distinct and not connected. The strictly row-wise concatenation performed here means that in principle the order of concatenation should not matter for these predictions. We do not claim in this work that unpaired MSAs necessarily have better performance than paired MSAs (which we did not test). Rather, we deliberately used unpaired MSAs to avoid co-evolutionary signals of full-length protein-protein interactions being used in the prediction of protein-fragment interactions. As we report in the manuscript, we find that the performance with unpaired MSAs and multiple chains modeled in AlphaFold2 with monomer weights is very good, with protein-fragment interactions predicted well without the model having been trained on multi-protein complexes (only single chains) and not using multi-chain MSA pairing. All of the above clarifications have now been added to the revised manuscript. 2) In Figure 2A, the peaks indicating inhibitory activity correlate positively with the observed peaks in calculated weighted N_contacts, which forms the basis for all inferences. However, the data reveals an interesting observation in the initial segment of the protein fragment (0 to 100 aa) that while there is a peak indicating predicted binding by the AlphaFold model, there is no corresponding inhibitory activity observed for the protein in that region. Any comments on this discrepancy? In the revised manuscript, we now discuss the predicted fragment binding peak centered around residue 60 of FtsZ, which lacks corresponding inhibitory activity in our high-throughput in vivo experiments. As we describe, this region maps to a region of the protein involved in filament formation and predicted to bind in a native-like manner by FragFold. However, this same region of the full-length protein was found to exhibit a high B-factor in previous crystallographic characterization of the binding interface, suggesting it contributes little to the binding energy (Schumacher et al. , Acta Cryst F 2020). We therefore note that this example peak represents a case of a plausible predicted binder which does not inhibit the parental full-length protein interaction. 3) The authors introduce (f_native,pairwise) and (f_native,binding) to quantify similarities between experimentally solved structures and AlphaFold2 models. We found the explanation of these metrics to be confusing, one refers to the fragment and the target site but the other refers to the native binding site bound by the fragment. Is one referring to the contacts made in the experimental structure and the other the contacts in the AlphaFold model? Further clarification of what these precisely correspond to would be helpful for discerning the similarities and differences between the two. Thanks to the reviewers for noting this opportunity to provide increased clarity. In the revised manuscript, we now clarify these terms at the time they are introduced. (These terms reflect, respectively, the fraction of pairwise fragment-protein contacts from experimental full-length (native) protein-protein interaction structures predicted by FragFold; and the fraction of target protein residues from the native, experimentally determined interaction mode predicted by FragFold to be bound by any fragment residue.) 4) In both figures 2 and 3 the authors show structures of the experimentally solved complexes and the predicted AlphaFold models side by side. We were curious to know whether the AlphaFold models were able to recapitulate the sidechain conformations. In addition we were also curious to know whether the AlphaFold model recapitulated any key contacts made between the binding site and the fragment (ex: salt bridges, electrostatic interactions between charged amino acids, pi-pi stacks, hydrogen bonds between sidechains). A full investigation of the quality of sidechain conformation predictions made by AlphaFold is beyond the scope of this work and has been previously considered by others (e.g., Karelina, Noh, and Dror, eLife 2023; Jumper et al. , Nature 2021). In prior work the root-mean squared deviation (RMSD) of all non-hydrogen atoms (including sidechains) between experimental structures and AlphaFold2 models was generally found to be low (e.g., median RMSD of 2.9 Å; Karelina, Noh, and Dror, eLife 2023) but not necessarily sufficient for docking small molecules as well as enabled by experimental structures. Although sidechain conformations were not a focus of our study – and we do not compare in detail between predicted and native structures – we do now provide several predicted protein-fragment binding mode structures including sidechains, comparing FragFold models to FragFold models relaxed with the Rosetta energy function (see new Figure S8). We find that in the predicted structures, details including sidechain orientations and hydrogen bonding patterns at interfaces tend not to change substantially upon Rosetta relaxation,  suggesting that the predicted binding modes are physically and biochemically reasonable (see also the section on further additions to the manuscript, below). 5) The authors explain their use of tiling to generate inhibitory fragments and that overlapping fragments generate greater predicted binding peaks. Have the authors attempted to use smaller fragments in their program (i.e. what is the smallest fragment size that AlphaFold can still predict to be correctly binding?). We are curious to know if effects vary by changing the fragment sizes. Further, can this method be expanded upon to study multiple different fragments that bind to different sites on the target protein simultaneously? We thank the reviewers for raising these interesting ideas. Here the reviewers point out several directions we are excited to pursue in future studies but that are outside of the scope of the current work. We focused on 30-amino acid fragments for all proteins except for LptG, because based on experimental data (Savinov, Swanson, and Fields, PNAS 2022) this fragment length tended to give the best signal-to-noise and specificity of inhibitory effects in these experiments. That said, for the case of LptG, both the experimental data and our FragFold predictions reported in this manuscript were for fragments of 14 amino acids, and we were successful in predicting inhibitory peaks at this fragment length. This result illustrates that the binding modes of fragments as short as 14 amino acids are capable of being predicted by FragFold, and we too are curious how far this finding generalizes, and whether even shorter fragments will still yield comparable results. The reviewers also raise an interesting idea regarding modeling multiple binding fragments simultaneously. While our goals in this work were to model single fragments, allowing direct comparison to our high-throughput experimental data in cells (where each cell expresses a single protein fragment), in the future modeling multiple fragments should allow prediction of synergistic inhibitors, which is a promising direction for designing superior inhibitory peptides, e.g., with multiple binding fragments connected by peptide linkers. Minor points: 1) The orange and yellow lines used to show contacts between the fragment and target are difficult to distinguish from each other. Consider a different set of colors? 2) Figure 4C+E. The use of black in the model makes it difficult to distinguish the sidechains and interactions with the fragment. We believe both of these issues were related to lower-resolution figures in the initial bioRxiv submission. The revised manuscript both includes higher-resolution figures, and in several cases larger figures, allowing for small details including contact lines and sidechain interactions to come through more clearly. A brief summary of further additions to the revised manuscript: In addition to our responses to the comments from San Felipe, Bajaj, and Fraser as summarized above, we herein provide a brief highlight of other changes and additions to the revised manuscript: •	We now include extensive experimental deep mutational scanning (DMS) data on several inhibitory protein fragments. These data reveal mutations that yield further improved inhibitory protein fragments, with implications for designing peptide-based therapeutics. The DMS data also provide systematic experimental support for the FragFold-predicted fragment binding modes, including for the novel binding modes predicted for the C-terminal fragment of FtsZ. •	We perform an analysis of predicted fragment binding energy with Rosetta to show that the predicted fragment binding modes are physically plausible and broadly consistent with those seen for known peptide binders with experimentally-determined structures. Furthermore, relaxation of FragFold predicted structures using the Rosetta force field does not substantially change the binding conformations or binding energies, suggesting the binding modes directly predicted by AlphaFold are reasonable without further adjustment. •	We perform additional extensive FragFold predictions against non-cognate protein partners to further demonstrate prediction specificity. •	We compare the performance of FragFold with an alternative approach, the Rosetta-based Peptiderive protocol.",2024-09-23T18:54:22,andrew_savinov,Andrew Savinov,10.1101/2023.12.19.572389,High-throughput computational discovery of inhibitory protein fragments with AlphaFold,"Andrew Savinov, Sebastian Swanson, Amy E.

The central premise of the paper is to use a yeast selection based around the oligmerizaton/aggregation of Sup35 fused to a peptide (in this case abeta) as a proxy for amyloid forming potential. This is cool information on its own and the experimental analysis and computational framework for linking to energies is top notch. The point of using double mutants to enhance the dynamic range is very well explained and will solidify their approach to impactfully link DMS experiments to thermodynamic concepts. The major framing of the paper revolves around an analytical protein folding/engineering concept of phi-values that highlights energetic differences in the importance of interactions for forming the transition state vs. the ground state. For the textual interpretation of the results, one must buy into the energetic effects of the Sup35 system as a readout of the transition state (and secondarily for FoldX calculations on various PDBs of abeta polymorphs to be a readout of the ground state). The major issue is that an alternative (and perhaps simpler) explanation is that mutations in APR2 are more disruptive to the Sup35 oligomerization process in the screen and that this reflects amyloid/oligomerization propensities and not strictly TS of initial nucleation. The data from previous studies that is used to draw correlations to justify their interpretation around the TS is buried in extended data figures and is a bit all over the place, especially the deconvolution of primary vs. secondary nucleation. The existence of multiple polymorphs in human cells (and populations), which may or may not have related transition states - and the exact conformational requirements of the Sup35 activation mechanism - further complicate this interpretation. In summary - this contains amazing data, but I do not see the language of the interpretations lining up with the strength of the _specificity_ of the claims about the transition state.  A fuller discussion of the limitations of the prior low throughput assays that are referenced in extended data 1 and 2 and detailed kinetic characterization of some of the more surprising mutants in a biochemically defined system would greatly improve the match between the data and the claims. These issues should not stop others from building on this beautiful work - but in doing so, other investigators should note that there remains ambiguity as to whether the effects are truly on the TS or on the ground state.

This is not true, so it's appropriate to respond here. Both commenters note that low p-values for relative risk maps (Figure 2 and Figure 4) require sufficient sampling density to obtain a low p-value. Of course, this is correct. Both commenters argue that this is misleading. I disagree. No co-author, peer reviewer, or editor involved was misled. News articles on the paper thus far have almost all portrayed the data and analysis accurately. We do not argue in the paper that SARS-CoV-2 could not have been found in places that were not sampled; I'm unaware of anyone making this argument based on our paper; it's not misleading if no one is misled. On top of this, the proportion of positive samples in each location is displayed along with the relative risk p-value. The n=1/1 sample that Bahry complains ""shows little heat"" is clearly indicated as a sampled location with high positivity in Fig 2A. And the underlying data is available in supplementary figures and tables. It's demonstratively not misleading. The other arguments the two commenters make consist of (1) arguing against a different paper published years ago, (2) a demand for a citation of an irrelevant paper, (3) arguing for an alternative analysis method without demonstrating that it would have more statistical power, (4) an argument that implicitly assumes all expectations for all coronaviruses are identical regardless of their hosts and modes of transmission, and lastly (5) a typo in a citation.

Approaches like this applied to GWAS variants enable the implication of processes or pathways potentially mediating the genetic effects on complex phenotypes even in the absence of co-localizing cis-eQTL signals, which is unfortunately typical of GWAS signals. This pre-print does not include a Discussion section, so it does not yet sufficiently place this work in the context of the relevant published literature. When this is done, I would recommend consideration of our work on expression regulator activity QTLs (aQTLs) that was published in PLOS Computational Biology a few years ago ( Hoskins et al., 2021). Our two approaches share a lot conceptually in that we both assume that shared variability among genes often reflects a common underlying regulatory mechanism and that multidimensional reduction of the expression information among such genes can provide a useful metric for summarizing the activity of the gene set. The approach in this pre-print is generalizable for use with any type of gene set deemed potentially relevant to the GWAS trait of interest, while our approach in Hoskins et al. (2021) is more tailored to gene sets representing the target genes of expression regulators based on tissue or cell type-specific co-expression networks where the activity scores are inferred using the VIPER algorithm developed by Andrea Califano’s group (Alvarez et al., 2016).

As far as I know, Jewish clades under Q are typically not Q1b1a3a1/Q-L332 (clades under Q-L245 are more typical). Q-L332 is a Y-chromosome haplogroup found in several bronze age Siberian populations, and is a fairly prominent lineage across Scythian populations during the iron age and antiquity (hence my interest in the remark above). Given the history of the Iberian peninsula, would it not be more plausible to attribute such lineages to the Alans? Sarmatians carried Y-chromosome haplogroup Q-L332, and there seem to be a decent amount of Spaniards and Portuguese which carry Sarmatian-related lineages to this day. Perhaps the R1a-Z94 lineage could also be there through Sarmatians but it would depend on the subclade, as R-Z94 is over 4000 years old and was carried by various peoples - mostly of Indo-Iranian origin however.

Sponge may have engulfed the mycobacteria from ablutions of an infected patient and entered in sponge along with incurrent water in spongocoel these mycobacteria were ingested by choanocyte where probably these bacteria were not digested and kept on multiplying. So it may be a possibility that this is not the mycobacteria originally from sponge but entered in sponge along with debris or ablutions of infected patient.",2024-09-15T19:00:15,,Dr. M.

(2024) identified a physical interaction between ERC1 and ATG8e, leading them to explore potential ATG8-interaction motifs (AIMs) in ERC1. Using the iLIR database (Jacomin et al., 2016) for AIM prediction, they found the results irrelevant to the ERC1-ATG8e interaction, indicating a false prediction. Through truncated ERC1 variants, they identified a non-canonical AIM undetectable by current prediction tools, which focus on the canonical [W/F/Y]-[X]-[X]-[L/I/V] sequence. They validated this motif with AlphaFold2-multimer (AFM), a method we previously demonstrated (Ibrahim et al., 2023) to accurately predict non-canonical AIMs, as shown with ATG3. Our findings were later confirmed in humans by Farnung et al. (2023) via X-ray crystallography. Despite their similar approach, Chung et al.
