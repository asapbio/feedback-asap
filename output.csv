One critique concerning the Ivory-billed Woodpecker-- the number quoted by Troy et al, 20 million dollars spent for studies, is misleading. Most of the efforts are university and private, not governmental, and if the bird is proven to be extant, will have conservation benefits since it is a wide-ranging and keystone species. I help with research for the Ivory-billed Woodpecker. The growing body of evidence that this species exists is more rational than the critique-- see other BioRxiv papers and the work of Mike Collins for example.

A significant strength lies in its interdisciplinary approach, integrating mathematical modeling, bioinformatics, and clinical insights to establish a framework for understanding the therapeutic effects of ozone therapy. The use of Lyapunov exponents, Shannon entropy, and fractal dimensions to quantify biological complexity is particularly innovative, providing a structured means of evaluating systemic responses to treatment. Additionally, the study’s emphasis on precision dosing—highlighting the differential effects of low versus high ozone concentrations—adds valuable insight into the hormetic nature of the therapy, reinforcing the need for controlled perturbations in medical interventions. The thorough review of existing literature, including randomized controlled trials, strengthens the credibility of the findings and underscores the translational potential of the proposed model. However, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The reliance on mathematical simulations, while insightful, may not fully capture the variability of real-world biological responses, as complex physiological interactions are difficult to model with absolute accuracy. Additionally, while the study references clinical data, it does not provide direct experimental validation, making it difficult to assess the immediate applicability of the findings in clinical practice. The concept of adaptive chaos, though compelling, remains somewhat abstract, and further empirical studies are needed to establish its clinical relevance definitively. Lastly, some of the statistical approaches, particularly the unusually high values of Lyapunov exponents, may require re-evaluation to ensure their biological plausibility and proper contextualization within established dynamical system theory. Despite these challenges, the study provides a groundbreaking theoretical framework with promising implications for regenerative medicine and personalized therapy.",2025-02-12T06:12:29,profsergiomannivanzini,Prof. Sergio Manni Vanzini,10.1101/2025.02.05.636618,Harnessing Adaptive Chaos: Exploring the role of oxygen-ozone therapy in modulating complexity and repair in spine disorders via a bio-informatic model,"Salvatore Chirumbolo, Marianno Franzini, Umberto Tirelli, Giovanni Ricevuti, Fortunato Loprete, Tommaso Richelmi, Francesco Vaiano, Antonio Carlo Galoforo, Marianna Chierchia, Luigi Valdenassi",2025-02-08

Many neurons in synergistic muscles are correlated with a unique subset of neurons. I strongly suggest you check with pearson correlation of the smoothed motor unit discharge rates. Also, force variability is only partly predicted by a single common input. Please stop assuming overly simplistic and reductionist conclusions.You also show that only 70% of the variance (which, in fact, should be 50 to 60% of the first component) is explained. In all other disciplines, it is usually concluded that it is only one component when it explains more than 90% of the variance! BOOK KNOWLEDGE: In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), when it's concluded that there is only one component, the first principal component should ideally explain a significant portion of the variance—typically more than 90%. However, the exact threshold can depend on the specific context or data, but generally, when a single component explains more than 90% of the variance, it's reasonable to conclude that this component captures the majority of the relevant information in the data. If the first component explains less than 90%, it might suggest that multiple components are needed to adequately represent the variance in the data, and assuming only one component could oversimplify the analysis. In your case, when discussing 70% variance, it might imply that the first component doesn't fully capture the structure of the data, and it could suggest that more components are necessary to explain a larger proportion of the variance.",2025-02-10T15:33:35,,Anonymous,10.1101/2025.02.04.635938,A single low-dimensional neural component of motor unit activity explains force generation across repetitive isometric tasks,"Hélio V.

The study by Chirumbolo et al. presents a compelling and innovative perspective on adaptive chaos and its role in modulating oxygen-ozone therapy for spine disorders. By integrating mathematical modeling, bioinformatics, and clinical insights, the authors provide a rigorous framework to understand how mild chaotic perturbations can enhance systemic complexity and biological resilience. A particular strength of this work lies in its multidimensional approach, incorporating Shannon entropy, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions to quantify the therapeutic impact of oxygen-ozone therapy. Therefire, in my opinion, the authors successfully demonstrate that low-dose ozone (20–40 µg/ml O3) fosters adaptive chaos, leading to reduced inflammation, enhanced repair, and improved systemic stability. In contrast, higher doses (>60 µg/ml O3) appear to push the system into pathological chaos, emphasizing the importance of precision dosing in regenerative medicine. Really interesting outcomes! The translational significance of this study cannot be overstated. It not only advances our understanding of chaos-driven medical interventions but also sets a precedent for personalized medicine strategies that leverage nonlinear dynamics to optimize therapeutic outcomes. Future research could expand on these findings by incorporating real-world clinical datasets and patient-specific modeling, further solidifying the role of adaptive chaos in medical practice. I trust this study is a landmark contribution to the fields of biophysics, complexity science, and regenerative medicine, offering novel insights into the interplay between biological chaos and therapeutic control.

First, the stimuli used by the authors here is static gratings vs drifting gratings. This alone should have made the discussion more nuanced than our paradigm is superior. While this study showed ""more samples"" per condition, the other study (mine) showed drifting gratings for 1.5s at 3Hz and so multiple samples per trial are shown (since phases are repeated in one showing). Drifting gratings have a motion component that leads to neuronal integration that could better pick up subtle differences in orientation selectivity. As for preferred spatial frequency, we both found that this was not perturbed. Yet, it should be noted that this ""superior"" study found the spatial frequency preferences were half those found in the inferior study (0.06 vs 0.12 cpd). In fact, their more coarse preferred spatial frequency values of adult V1 is more in line with our measurements in juvenile mice. Moreover, the way they carried out behavior (one screen grey, one with the same orientation but at varying spatial frequency) can only detect deficits in spatial acuity, which is is just one aspect determining visual acuity and is one that we both agree was not altered anyhow. Lastly, this ""superior"" study fails to show that they can measure immature responses as they never measured responses in juveniles. Given that their spatial frequency preferences match our juvenile values, the validity of their bold title is brought into question. The inferior study also had inhibitory neuron responses gathered in parallel, thus showing that a range of visual tuning properties can be measured by the inferior study authors. But sure, go ahead and discuss science as black and white rather than have a more nuanced discussion.",2025-01-28T19:01:35,,Dario,10.1101/2023.10.17.562708,Microglia are dispensable for experience-dependent refinement of visual circuitry,"Thomas C.

Supplementary Figure 1: The authors describe the injection of 300 ng peptides, but Supplementary Figure 1 shows variations in TIC signal intensities for the compared techniques. These differences may stem from the two different peptide quantification assays employed and described in the study. From a mass spectrometry perspective, such discrepancies make it challenging to technically compare different enrichment techniques due to the influence of signal intensity variations on the S/N ratio, peak-picking algorithms, peptide quantities, and sequence coverage. We recommend to repeat the study and use our recommendations for peptide quantification compatible to ENRICHplus. In addition, it is important to acknowledge that the ENRICHplus pre-release version was employed for the comparison, which differs from the commercial version scheduled for release on February 22, 2025. PreOmics is always supportive if customers struggle to achieve expected results with our solutions and we are keen to support you and provide our recommendations to achieve the best results possible.",2025-01-22T08:26:37,,PreOmics,10.1101/2025.01.08.632035,A Technical Evaluation of Plasma Proteomics Technologies,"William F.

As an example a channel in which Calcium acts as an activator would produce the same apparent effects. In order to really show that this is a Calcium channel the authors would need to show that there are no changes in the open probability in the different conditions. That's why in the field the GHK voltage equation with bi-ionic potentials is used.
