https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.14.382846v1#comment-6288420915,biorxivstage,1,"Dear authors, First and foremost, we would like to congratulate you on your work. The text is relevant given the context of climate change and despite the inherent complexity of this subject and the extensive analysis conducted, you effectively guided the discussion in a clear and compelling manner. We also found the research idea and the results obtained to be quite intriguing, showing how different climate variables influence beta diversity and its components. In particular, the taxonomic diversity being more aligned with phylogenetic and functional diversity in the tropics as opposed to temperate and polar regions, is a very interesting finding. That being said, we believe that some of the results could have been further explored in the discussion section and that the introduction could use additional information to highlight the work's importance and clarify some of the choices made, such as more details on why the LGM was chosen for comparison. Below, we provide a list of specific suggestions that we hope could contribute to your work, especially for the clarification of some of the results and methods used and for a more comprehensive discussion section. List of specific comments: The importance of your work and how it relates to current climate change could be further emphasized in the introduction section. It is mentioned that precipitation seasonality was the main variable explaining total beta-diversity. This result could be better explored in the discussion, as it was only briefly mentioned in the results section. Consider integrating some of the limitations identified in the methodology section in the discussion as well. For example, the explanation on how the gaps in the functional traits dataset could affect your results. As it is mentioned in the discussion section, the climate changes that are happening now are different from the changes that happened in the last glaciation. We believe the comparisons made between them and the conclusions reached could be expressed with less certainty. While the importance of conserving a network of protected areas in regions with rare species is indicated in the discussion section, this subject could have received more attention. It's also worth emphasizing in the text that such actions will likely not be enough to stop climate change-driven extinctions on their own. The high beta-diversity in regions such the Sahara transition and the USA is an intriguing result that could be investigated. In the models, the r² values are high for the combined variables, but relatively low for individual variables. The study focuses on the effects of the LGM anomaly, but we believe that a more in-depth exploration of the interactions among the studied variables would be beneficial. We found it unclear what corresponds to a “species” (used in taxonomic diversity) in the context of phylogenetic and functional diversity. Do these correspond to functional and phylogenetic groups? Figure 1a caption is somewhat confusing, as it mentions beta diversity but only shows LGM anomaly. In figures 2 and 4, we recommend that all sub-figures share a consistent scale to facilitate comparisons between them. Figures 2 (j, k and l) and 4 could use a different color scale. Light yellow is especially difficult to discern from the background white. The inclusion of a table with the description of all environmental variables used to compare with beta-diversity might be beneficial to the understanding of the reader. We hope that our suggestions will help in further improving the quality of your work.

The topic is timely, and the manuscript brings a useful tool to build a fast evaluation of the extinction risk for species that have not yet been assessed by the IUCN. The high number of species without conservation status assessment (~82% of all vascular plants) was a big surprise to us, taking this number into account we believe the proposed tool can help to advance in the classification of conservation status. Predictions of extinction risk could help to prioritise assessment efforts for species predicted with high certainty to be threatened and also for species with uncertain predictions, which could be triaged as Data Deficient and prioritised for further fieldwork. We enjoyed reading this manuscript very much, but we have some questions that were raised during a lab meeting planned to discuss this preprint, which we leave below. 1) We know that many new species described in recent years are listed as threatened in the description, however this information is not included in the IUCN Red List. So, our question is, why is this information not reaching the IUCN, what alternatives could be applied to overcome this issue? 2) We saw that it is available a more recent data on the Human Footprint, which is Sanderson et al. but it is a preprint article ( https://doi.org/10.32942/os..., why was this reference not used? 3) In 2017 was published an update on ecoregions, we saw that the changes from Olson et al. 2001 are few, but why did you choose to work with the oldest instead of Dinerstein et al. (2017)? Dinerstein, E., Olson, D., Joshi, A., Vynne, C., Burgess, N. D., Wikramanayake, E., ... & Saleem, M. (2017). An ecoregion-based approach to protecting half the terrestrial realm. BioScience, 67(6), 534-545. We also leave some suggestions to the authors: 1)  	It would be interesting to map the results by biome (the results were shown by botanical country, Fig. 2). It is our belief that the species in the botanical country of Northeastern Brazil are from the Atlantic Forest (AF) and not from the Caatinga because the level of degradation is higher in the AF and there are also many more studies in the AF than in the Caatinga. This map would be of more interest to researchers working on specific biomes. 2)  	We think it would be useful to provide a list with the classification (conservation status predictions) and degree of uncertainty for each species. 3)  	Some tables in the Supplementary Information that are .csv files (e.g. Table S3) are not accessible … or we do not know how to access them. Congratulations to all the authors, this paper is an excellent contribution, providing predictions of conservation status for each species, which can provide a basis from which full Red List assessments can progress more quickly.

I am currently being supervised by Professor Juliane Karine Ishida. Throughout my academic career, I have been studying the interaction between plants and microorganisms, and your preprint titled ""Disease Resistance correlates with Core Microbiome Diversity in Cotton"" caught my attention. Recently, our research group received an invitation to evaluate preprints in order to gain experience and contribute to the advancement of science. Therefore, I have chosen your work for discussion in one of our meetings. In collaboration with other colleagues, we have brought forth some suggestions to assist in improving your article, and we hope they may prove useful to you. We noticed a lack of introductory content in his introduction, which would be essential to better understand his study. (Lines 95-100) - The explanation of cotton leaf roll disease (CLCuD) and its economic implications for the country is provided only at the conclusion of the preprint. We believe these topics could be explored in more depth in your introduction. We also note that the text is not structured into categories such as introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion. We understand that this may be in line with the journal's guidelines. In your methodology section (lines 62 - 68), we missed a more detailed description of your samples. For example, we are curious about the distribution of samples among susceptible, partially tolerant, and fully tolerant varieties. Furthermore, it would be useful to know how many samples are attributed to epiphytic leaves, endophytic leaves, rhizosphere, and endophytic roots. We suggest that compiling this data into a supplementary table could be beneficial. These are some small contributions we offer to help you further improve and refine your work. We hope these suggestions are valuable to you in advancing your research.

I completely agree that we need to sequence more individual mosquitoes, if we ever want to understand the complex relationships between insect-specific viruses, arboviruses and their hosts. However, I have one big remark that I hope you consider to change in the published version of this manuscript. On line 175, you mention 393 mosquito-associated viruses and you define them as the 'core mosquito virome' for the rest of the manuscript. I feel that this term is too broad to describe just all your mosquito-associated viruses (some of them might be found in only one or very few individual mosquitoes). In general, a core microbiome can be defined as a set of taxa that consistently occur within a given habitat type or host (see https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.01066-22 and https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2104429118). Also, Shi et al. (Microbiome, 2019), one of the first papers to describe a core virome in mosquitoes, describes the core mosquito virome as ""a set of viruses found in the majority of individuals in a particular mosquito population"". Could you change the use of this term in your manuscript to avoid confusion for readers and have a consistent use of the term ""core virome"" in future research?

Namely, what is the definition of 'Boy's Love culture', as it pertains to this study? Is it the consumption of all BL media, or only specific genres featuring homosexual couplings? Is it explicit material, or romantic? What medium; film, novel, cartoon, or comic? Furthermore, what is this BL media cocoon? How, in this research, has this been identified? Was this coined for the research alone, or is it an adopted term from a previous research? Perhaps a brief note to the start of this article to explain the terminology being used in this research could provide clarity. Regarding the method used for this research, I am concerned with the lack of information regarding the individuals that participated in this investigation. Firstly, what is the demographic? Young females is a very broad definition that can have a varied definition; do you mean females under the age of 18? Between 18 - 25? I acknowledge that there is mention of participants 'first exposure' to BL content, and the recruitment section does mention the number of participants, but the demographic is still not listed adequately. The context behind this investigation mentions the 'globalised' nature of young females and BL consumption, but the research was conducted within the singular community of Henan University. This causes a direct conflict with the contention of this work (BL media and the social media influence it wields) and the described 'information cocoon', as the participants come from an individual environment and therefore cannot be accurately described as global fans, especially as they are part of the same University community.  These are important disclaimers that should be mentioned a bit more explicitly. There are also studies mentioned within this article that are not cited, such as the 'fMRI study' referenced on the first page. Nor is there a mention on how the research environment was controlled. I must also question the images used for Experiment 1: Image Rating. The direct comparison between the 6 images shows a significant difference in composition that I cannot dismiss as not interfering with the project. The 3 photos listed on the left are all intimate photographs of homosexual couples; shots above their shoulders and close together. However on the right, we have 3 photos of heterosexual couples that have vastly different compositions, with one photograph depicting a couple from afar, with their backs turned and faces concealed. This is a stark difference from the other photographs, and perhaps--if only a selection of 6 photographs from many--these should be reviewed and reselected to better align the compositions.",2023-09-23T00:55:22,disqus_fMyuNqm8rJ,Raven,10.1101/2023.09.18.558088,Neurological Imprints of Boys’ Love Culture: Shaping Sexual Orientation Identity in the Digital Age’s Young females,"Na Ao, Xiaowei Jiang, Yanan Chen, Yingying Chen, Huihui Niu, Shuoyan Hu",2023-09-21

Nevertheless, deviations from this minimal model have been observed over the years[4]. Work from groups including Klinmman[27,28] and Daniel and Danson[21] have exemplified this unexpected, non-Arrhenius behavior of enzymes and have sought to apply models to these observations, including an equilibrium between active and inactive states of the substrate-bound enzyme[21]. Åqvist and colleagues [5] have sought to distinguish between competing models, including the activation heat capacity model from this manuscript, and the equilibrium model. In the literature, there are contradictory reports regarding the role of activation heat capacity [22,8], leaving the debate on the origin of non-linear temperature dependence of activity unresolved. This paper aims to characterize conformational changes during catalysis through the lens of activation heat capacity. The authors used MalL as a model system and conducted kinetics experiments over a range of temperatures to calculate changes in the heat capacity of activation. Using molecular dynamics, the authors simulate a narrowed conformational landscape of a transition state-like MalL in comparison to wild-type. Based on the observed kinetic behavior of MalL across a wide range of temperatures, the authors presented MMRT-2S, a modified version of Macromolecular Rate Theory (MMRT) that accounts for a cooperative transition between the enzyme-substrate conformation and the transition state-like conformation. The major strength of this paper is high quality temperature-dependent kinetic data collected over a range of temperatures typically not explored, which allows us to evaluate complex models to describe unexpected enzymatic behavior. The major confusion we have with this paper is the lack of details needed to aid the reader in interpreting the data: namely not presenting the hydrogen bond measurements and statistics to demonstrate significance, and a lack of controls or citations for kinetic assay assumptions. Overall, this paper presents an intriguing explanation for the role of conformational changes in catalysis to reconcile diverse observations noted in enzyme literature. Major points: Substrate Saturation, Denaturation Controls, and Assay Set-Up According to the methods section, saturating concentrations of p-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside were assayed. It would be helpful if exact concentrations were reported for reproducibility of the work. Furthermore, it is important to mention if Km has been reported at the range of temperatures assayed for this substrate, to confirm saturation. The text mentions that nonlinearity has been reported in this absence of denaturation; this statement could be strengthened if controls or references were included to corroborate this. From the description in the methods section, we believe the enzyme is not incubated at the assay temperature prior to the reaction, so over the course of the limited reaction time (45 seconds) we are unsure if the enzyme has reached a folded/conformational equilibrium. Furthermore, we think it would be informative for readers if the authors include discussion about foldedness being unlikely to be a contributor to changes in kcat. Mutant Structure Rationale The rationale for creating the S536R mutant is unclear to us. Although we agree that “introducing new hydrogen bond networks at the surface of the protein” is one way to perturb conformational dynamics and rates, we are unsure why arginine was selected as the residue for this. We are also unsure why the X-ray structures were determined in the presence of urea. Mutant / TLC Activity The mutant structure shows a distinct ensemble via the PCA projection. It is important to discuss if activity data collected for this mutant should be expectedly different from WT based on the MMRT-2S model. Hydrogen Bond Measurement Given the difference in crystal packing between the wild-type and mutant structures, it is important to identify if any of the hydrogen bonds of interest are proximal to a gained or lost crystal contact between the two structures. Additionally, while truncating the data to a similar resolution will remove high resolution reflections from the mutant structure, the reflections around 2.3Å will likely have higher signal:noise, which complicates analysis. It would be helpful for readers to have more details on the hydrogen bonds mentioned in Figure 5A – for example, by creating a table of the residues involved in each bond and the amount that the bond was shortened. Further interpretation of the shortened hydrogen bonds would also be helpful; for example, we are curious if the authors consider all the shortened hydrogen bonds as equal contributors to the restricted conformational landscape of the TLC, or if there are certain ones that the authors believe are more impactful. Additionally, for those unfamiliar with MD, more commentary on the interplay between structural data and MD simulations would be instructive. For example, are residue motions observed in MD simulations consistent with the hydrogen bonding differences observed in the static structure? ADH Comparison We are unsure if the authors’ claims contrasting MalL and ADH at different temperatures are supported by the data, given that there was no MD performed on ADH. For MalL, we were able to visualize the restricted conformational landscape of the TLC via a combination of MD simulations and structural data. For ADH, only Cp is calculated from kinetics data, and there is no structure or MD data presented. Arguing that there is a more restricted conformational landscape based on Cp alone seems insufficient compared to the amount of work done on MalL. Perhaps citing more previous literature on ADH in detail would be helpful for strengthening the contrast between MalL and ADH. Minor points: Language / Word Choice: Use of word “significant” should be reserved for demonstrated statistical significance Qualifiers like “very” were used frequently and distract from the data and claims in themselves, particularly in section headers i.e., “Very High Resolution Structure...” “Accurate” should be replaced with “precise” when describing collected data, as the data themselves are observations of  ground truth, and the narrow distribution of replicates implies high precision Scope The claim “The importance of activation heat capacity for enzyme kinetics has been the subject of debate recently” is supported by 3 self-references, out of four total. In previous work, the authors identify that MMRT applies to chemically-limited catalysis, which should be mentioned in the discussion regarding the applicability of the model, and cite Kern and Hilser’s works on adenylate kinase as an edge case as in the author’s previous reviews. Figures In general, the addition of more labels/legends on the plots would help with interpretation. Specific examples: Figure 2: labeling the color that corresponds to each mutant Figure 3: labeling deuterated vs protiated Figure 3D: labeling which curves correspond to ∆H and ∆S Figures 4A & 4B: For clarity, the different regions of MalL (lid, active site, loop, etc.) could be labeled here. Furthermore, arrows depicting the motions observed in PCA1 and PCA2 would be informative. Figure 5A: For clarity, the S536R mutation could be labeled here. - Daphne Chen, Duncan Muir, Margaux Pinney, Jaime Fraser",2023-09-22T23:48:41,disqus_beuvAwjXuv,Duncan Muir,10.1101/2023.07.06.548038,Cooperative conformational transitions and the temperature dependence of enzyme catalysis,"Emma J.

These results are thorough, compelling and persuasive. They also stand in contrast with other papers, published in the aftermath of alphafold's release, that argue the opposite.

It is therefore unclear how much of the results should be attributed to the neural network itself and how much should be attributed to the minimization step following structure prediction.

Our original finding that the peptide PEN is an agonist of GPR83 was already verified by two different laboratories (see Foster et al, 2019, “Discovery of Human Signaling Systems: Pairing Peptides to G Protein-Coupled Receptors”, Cell, PMID: 31675498; and Parobchak et al, 2020, “Uterine Gpr83 mRNA is highly expressed during early pregnancy and GPR83 mediates the actions of PEN in endometrial and non-endometrial cells”, FS Science, PMID: 35559741). However, when another laboratory can’t confirm what was published, it is important to consider differences between the studies. With this in mind, there are several issues with the study presented here in the BioRxiv report by Giesecke et al. Additional experiments described below would be very helpful. The HEK293 cell line has been reported to express GPR83 mRNA in many studies listed in GEO Profile, and this is confirmed in the current study (Figure 1A). In the figure showing overexpression of HA-tagged GPR83 in HEK293 cells, the distribution is largely intracellular, maybe ER or Golgi (Figure 1B). Thus, it’s not relevant to consider ‘100-fold’ overexpression based on mRNA, as the amount that is correctly folded and expressed at the cell surface may not be much different than in the native HEK293 cell line. Furthermore, the authors show that PEN peptide does produce a robust increase in phosphoERK in Figure 4A (compare the lanes labeled ‘control’ and ‘PEN’). Furthermore, it looks like the PEN-mediated increase in phosphoERK is several fold higher in GPR83-transfected cells than in control cells (Figure 4A). Although the quantitation panel in Figure 4B doesn’t show an increase, there are very large ‘error bars’ reported to be SD, but for N=2 doesn’t SD really mean the range of duplicates? Also, please show all data points in the bar graph! In any case, it would be nice to see a larger N for these studies. But best of all would be a knock-down of GPR83 in HEK293 cells using siRNA, or a related approach. Another point is that in the PEN-GPR83 peptide-receptor system, signaling assays that are distal to the receptor activity (cAMP, PLC) tend to give variable results – this has been previously noted in our original study (Gomes et al, PMID: 27117253). This also appears to be the case with the TANGO assay where we have recently found that long-term treatment with PEN (16 hrs) causes a desensitization of the receptor leading to a complete loss of signal (our unpublished observations). There are also issues with the concentration dependence, and ‘u-shaped’ curves where high concentrations of PEN fail to produce the effects seen with lower concentrations (PMID: 27117253). The authors should repeat the studies with shorter times and lower concentrations of PEN. The lack of binding with Tyr-PEN seen by Giesecke et al. could be due to the presence of an internal His residue in human PEN (YAADHDVGSELPPEGVLGALLRV). Tyr-PEN  used in our previous studies for iodination was the rat sequence, which does not have a His. Because His residues can be iodinated using the chloramine T procedure used by Giesecke et al, this can potentially affect binding. It would be good to test binding with iodinated rat Tyr-PEN, to avoid the His residue. Also, why the C-term amide group? That’s not part of PEN. For the Ca++ assays, Giesecke et al. used Gα16, but our previous studies used Gα16/i3 (PMID: 27117253). This is not a minor difference. Ideally, Giesecke et al could repeat the experiments with Gα16/i3. Finally, protease inhibitors were used in the binding studies by Giesecke et al, which is good. It is not clear if such inhibitors were used in all other studies with PEN, such as those described in Figure 2 and 3. In the absence of protease inhibitors, PEN could be degraded during the assays and this could have accounted for the negative results.

The resulting confidence interval is of course, massive. It is not surprising that it overlaps with other estimates that essentially also estimate the tMRCA of A and B. I fail to see how this adds anything new or supports any conclusion. Figure 2's use of p-values does not properly account for the extreme sampling bias: sampling intensity around the wildlife stalls was much higher than elsewhere. More sampling leads to better p-values. Tom Wenseleers' analysis here is more proper: https://twitter.com/TWensel... Figure 2 B is particularly vulnerable to this bias, as the sequencing attempts were extremely clustered. Figure 2C seems to have omitted some data points: compare with this from Tom Wenseleers again: https://twitter.com/TWensel... Overall, the data actually points to an area near the market entrance/the toilets/the mah jong rooms, and the ""hot areas"" are not over the wildlife stalls. The sampling bias is also particularly visible in figure 3B, which would seem to show an association of human reads with wildlife stalls, when of course, the presence of humans was fairly uniform throughout the market (likely higher concentrations around the entrance/toilets/bathrooms) Figure 4 is notable because it shows CoVs definitively associated with wildlife had a significantly different distribution than SARS-CoV-2. Either SARS-CoV-2 did not emerge from those wilflife stalls, or too much time had passed to make any conclusions. It also serves as evidence against their argument that SARS-CoV-2 RNA from infected animals would have decayed substantially (as the other CoV RNA apparently had not). Figure 5 is interesting, but it does not establish where any of the animals came from. It simply rules out Vietnam and a Chinese provine north of Hubei. The authors then proceed to engage in pure speculation about the possibility of the Raccoon dogs coming from an area known to have SARS-CoV-2 like viruses.

The authors present compelling evidence that fine-tuning sequence-based machine learning models (protein language models) on in-house experimental data can accelerate the discovery of high-affinity binders, in this case against CD40. However, the entire manuscript is focused on single-chain nanobodies, not antibodies as the text suggests, and the authors only mention this in second and third paragraphs of Results as well as the caption of Figure 2. This is an extremely important distinction and I think the authors need to revise their language throughout the document to make this clear; i.e., use the term nanobody, not antibody. Nanobodies differ from antibodies in several key respects, such as loop lengths, which are discussed here: doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023..... Relevant to this manuscript is the fact that they comprise a single chain, and are thus amenable to out-of-the-box masked and/or autoregressive protein language models. Standard antibodies consist of two chains; to my knowledge, only one method, which has not been peer reviewed, has been trained on paired antibody sequences: arxiv.org/abs/2308.14300. Thus, several obstacles still exist that prevent the methods described here from being directly translated to standard monoclonal antibodies.

The authors write, Prior studies calculated correlations of SARS-CoV-2 detection and animal sequence read abundances in market samples, concluding that SARS-CoV-2 was negatively correlated with mammalian wildlife species (Liu et al. 2023; Bloom 2021). The intended citation is presumably to ( Bloom 2023), not to ( Bloom 2021). 2. The authors claim that ""The start of the COVID-19 pandemic was traced epidemiologically to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market"" (p. 3). This is false or misleading. After the first-detected market-linked cluster was noticed, this led the search for more cases to focus heavily on the market: i.e., that is simply where the local Chinese authorities looked, as they have made clear in repeated statements ( Bahry 2023, Table 1). For instance, the WHO-China joint study emphasizes the ""epidemiology surveillance at several hospitals (close to Huanan market), Huanan market and the neighbourhood of Huanan market"" ( WHO-China 2021, Annex p. 125). Strangely, the authors do not cite these repeated warnings about sampling bias in the early search, by those who did the search. Nor do they cite my critique ( Bahry 2023) of their earlier attempt to control for such bias ( Worobey et al. 2022). 3. Strangely, the authors' heat map in their ""relative risk"" analysis of positivity rate (Fig. 2a) shows very little heat for the highest-positivity-rate stall: a beef stall in the east wing with 1/1 samples positive (cf. Bahry 2023, Fig. 1). Although the authors do not explain this anomaly, it seems to be due to an analytical strategy which downplays less-sampled stalls. Their heat map does not depict stalls' positivity rates: rather it depicts the p-values of stalls' positivity rates. However, smaller samples will automatically have lower p-values for the same positivity rate, due to smaller samples having lower power to detect the same effect size. Thus, rather than showing the spatial distribution of elevated positivity, their heat map more reflects the spatial distribution of sampling effort (heavily concentrated in the southwest wildlife corner). An alternative approach would have been to map relative risk itself, estimated with smoothing by pseudocounts (cf. Bahry 2023, Fig. 1). Estimating positivity as s +0.077/ n +1, for s positives out of n samples, takes into account both the 7.7% positivity base rate, and noise due to uncertainty in less-sampled stalls.",2023-09-17T03:50:07,davidbahry,David Bahry,10.1101/2023.09.13.557637,Genetic tracing of market wildlife and viruses at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Alexander Crits-Christoph, Joshua I.

We collectively agreed it's a stimulating contribution to understanding how individual specialization emerges and is maintained in natural populations. Most of the literature on the causes of individual specialization focuses on the ecological (i.e., extrinsic) causes of this phenomenon (sensu Araújo et al. 2011 Ecology Letters), while the proximate causes (e.g., functional trade-offs, social status) have surprisingly been little studied. Part of this discrepancy is due to the challenges of testing whether and how individuals' intrinsic traits influence their trophic preferences. This preprint adds a novel level of complexity to the field by quantifying (i) the relative contribution of largely overlooked proximate causes (social learning, maternal effects, genetic factors) and (ii) the simultaneous effects of ecological (i.e., environment context) and proximate causes. We were positively impressed by the quality of the data and statistical analyses during our discussion. The resolution and temporal extent of the data used are unprecedented in the literature, and the Bayesian framework implemented is thorough. As we appreciated the quantitative approaches, our discussion focused mainly on how the question is motivated in the introduction and the major implications of the results. We agreed that the introduction outlines well how the measured factors are expected to drive individual heterogeneity. Still, a more general framing of the research questions could make the manuscript more appealing to a broader and more diverse readership. For instance, the introduction begins by explaining that environmental factors are key drivers of trophic niche variation. However, unraveling how individuality emerges in natural systems, by nature and/or nurture, is a general question that is still widely open in different areas of science - and we believe this manuscript provides exciting results in this regard. In the discussion, the fact that maternal learning, maternal effect, and environment combined explain most of the variance in trophic position (lines 297-299) could be further explored to emphasize the importance of simultaneously studying proximate and ecological causes of individual specialization. Also, the sizable residual observed in the ""Maternal learning"" model suggests that understanding what generates trophic diversity within populations is far more complex than initially thought, particularly in species with complex social structures, creating a stimulating challenge for future studies.

HTT depletion clearly induces a re-location (not a mis-location-since drebrin can locate to filopodia) from the T-zone to filopodia.  Unsurprisingly, given that the drebrin/EB3/Cdk5 pathway enables the capture of dynamic microtubules by filopodia, this is associated with a striking increase in microtubules in filopodia-actually the most significant change you measured in HTT-depleted growth cones.  Drebrin in the T-zone is largely unphosphorylated at S142 and therefore in the folded conformation, which can bind anti-parallel F-actin through one of its two F-actin binding sites.  In contrast, drebrin in filopodia is phosphorylated at S142 and therefore in the open conformation, enabling it to bind to parallel F-actin bundles using both F-actin binding sites.  Drebrin can cross-link F-actin to dynamic microtubules by binding to EB3 in filopodia.  Another manipulation that re-locates drebrin (our unpublished observations) and myosin IIB from the T-zone to filopodia is the inhibition of myosin II by blebbistatin, which essentially disassembles the F-actin in the T-zone removing an impediment to microtubule advance into the P-domain (Hur et al., 2011, P.N.A.S. 108, 5057-5062; Shin et al., 2014, PLoS ONE 9(4): e95212. doi:10.1371; Dupraz et al., 2019, Current Biology 29, 3874–3886).

The principle is to embed both the states (graph nodes) and the actions (graph edges) in the same high-dimensional space, such that the graph distances are represented by geometric distances between nodes, and the actions correspond to directions in the space. Then the agent can pursue the shortest route by choosing the action that points in the direction of the target node. The embeddings of both states and actions are learned during random exploration of the graph, based on optimizing a prediction of the next state from the previous state and action. Ultimately the embedding should be such that the next state can be predicted by simply adding the action vector to the previous state. The authors argue that all this can be accomplished with biologically plausible learning rules. Evaluation This is an interesting suggestion for how an agent might learn the structure of its environment, namely how states and actions are connected. This ultimately results in a goal signal, by which the correct action can be chosen that leads to the goal in the shortest amount of time. Some of my questions concern whether the algorithms are really neuromorphic, in the sense that they could be implemented in biological neural circuits. Concerns about bio-plausibility: 1. The learning rule for state-action association, Eqns 2 and 3: This looks difficult to implement with neurons, because: a) it involves two different time points on the post-synaptic side: s_{t+1} appears at time t+1, but \hat s_{t+1} at time t; b) to make s_{t+1} appear in that neural population, the action vector must temporarily be switched off, requiring some kind of control system; c) the postsynaptic variable is a difference between two successive time points. It is not obvious how to implement such a delta rule with biophysics. 2. The computation of utility, Eqn 4: Again, how would this be implemented with neurons? a) It involves multiplying a population vector with another vector in the same population; what would be the mechanism for such a multiply-and-add operation? b) In the left term, the activity is driven by an action; in the right term, activity of the same neurons is driven by observations. How would that be accomplished? c) The right term involves subtracting activity from the current observations from activity driven by some remembered observation. How are the remembered observations stored? Are these fed into the network one after another? How are they subtracted? 3. Normalization of synaptic weights a) Eqn 5: Here each input synapse gets modified by a factor that depends on the strengths of all the other synapses onto that same neuron. This violates the locality of synaptic plasticity: A synapse should be modified based only on its own strength and the activity of the pre-and postsynaptic neurons. b) Another related normalization appears in line 660. 4. Winner-take-all choice (Eqn 7): Explain how this would work in a neuromorphic system? How does the agent sample the values of the affordable actions? By actually executing them in the real world one at a time and comparing the resulting output from Eqn 4? But then the observations o_t would change as all the actions are played out. Or is the comparison done “mentally” without real-world action? If so, does this require some accessory system that can look up the codes of all the affordable actions and feed them into the network one at a time? In summary, if the authors advocate that this model could be implemented in brains, it would be helpful if the proposal included a bio-plausible neural circuit for each of these operations. Other questions: 5. Graphs with cycles a) As pointed out (p.9), the theory behind this learning model causes problems with cyclic graphs. All the graph edges are supposed to be orthogonal in the embedding space, yet adding the edges around a loop should give zero. Both can’t be true. It is not clear how this conflict was resolved. Does it require careful parameter tuning so as to sustain performance of the model? b) Line 585 describes a hack by which the agent was prevented from traveling cycles during exploration. That requires oracular knowledge of the graph. How would that work in a real-world system? 6. The concept of “action” a) In the first part of the paper (p.1-12), every edge on the graph is considered a different action, and they are all encoded with one-hot vectors. For example, a robot action like “turn left” would have a different one-hot code at every different location. This is somewhat different from the common concept of “action”, which is specific to the agent’s movements, not where they are executed. By postulating a one-hot code for every edge on the graph one effectively circumvents the problem of path integration, which requires making a prediction from stringing together actions that may appear identical from the agent’s perspective. b) Please explain how a naive agent entering a new environment will already have a one-hot code for every edge on the graph, even if they involve identical movements of the agent. c) What if the actions instead were agent-centered, e.g. {left, right, forward, back} as in the second part of the paper (p.13ff). Would the system still be able to learn an arbitrary graph? 7. “Affordances” a) What is the source of the “affordances” in Eqn 6. They represent part of the graph structure. Don’t these need to be learned as well? In the present formulation it seems they are offered to the system without learning (contra line 194). b) By what mechanism would this happen in a neuromorphic system, and how would they be represented by the neural circuit? c) Figure 4e highlights the fact that the agent takes an action that was never taken during exploration (Fig 4c). But what if there was a wall between those two nodes, and that’s why the action never occurred there? How does the agent know that the action is “affordable”. 8. Parameter sensitivity a) It appears that for each of the illustrated graphs the embedding space had a different dimensionality, and different choices were made for the learning rates (p.22). In line 610, the state space has fewer dimensions than the number of actions, which obviously precludes finding orthogonal vectors. What motivated all these different choices? b) How robust is the system to the relevant parameters? Can the same agent with one parameter set learn different spaces? The report would benefit from exploring a wider range of graphs and scanning over parameter values. 9. Related work There is prior research on these topics that could be used to put the current work in context. In particular, various versions of model-based reinforcement learning acquire the structure of the state space through learning, so that a goal-directed policy can be superposed on that. The present paper only deals with learning the state space, not with learning the goal locations: Those are provided by some unspecified accessory system. Within the RL literature there has been recent enthusiasm about the ""successor representation”, which is an embedding that helps predict the agent’s next state. For neuromorphic models that learn the successor representation, see for example Fang 2023 ( https://doi.org/10.7554/eLi... and literature cited there. Other suggestions: 10. There is frequent reference to “planning”. But the model presented here doesn’t make any plans. Once it arrives at a node it decides on the next action, as though it had a lookup table (see line 13). It does not “think ahead”. In the neuroscience and robotics field, “planning” usually concerns evaluating the outcome of successive actions ahead of time, for example comparing the value of different routes. The behavior implemented here is more like “online navigation”. This may be confusing to the reader. 11. In Figures 4 and 5, is there a meaning to the emojis painted on the nodes? At least this reader finds them distracting. Preceding figures worked just fine without emojis. 12. In part 2 (p.13ff) the main difference from part 1 is that the actions are now agent-centric. It may help the reader to point this out. Because there are only 4 action vectors, the predictions are forced into a 4-dimensional subspace of the high-dimensional space. Eventually, the learning process squeezes that into a 2-dimensional subspace that accurately reproduces the geometry of the graph. 13. Eqn 4: should start with u_t= 14. Figure 6c: Perhaps show a bit more of the time course to document that the two variables have settled. 15. Fig 2 caption: “square root of the length of the shortest path” should this be “square root of the sum of squares along the shortest path”. As stated, it doesn’t resemble the law of Pythagoras. 16.

I have selected your preprint titled ""Long noncoding RNAs emerge from transposon-derived antisense sequences and may contribute to infection stage-specific transposon regulation in a fungal phytopathogen"" for reading and critical review. In this manuscript, Qian and colleagues conduct an extensive study on the identification, classification, and investigation of transposable elements (TEs) and ncRNAs in the genome of Blumeria hordei, a powdery mildew fungal pathogen of Hordeum vulgare (Barley). This is a highly interesting manuscript; the methods are well-documented in the literature, and the results are significant. In my opinion, the authors could provide more information in the Introduction about the infection cycle of B. hordei, as understanding this pathogenic process is crucial for interpreting the presented results. Additionally, here are some specific comments regarding questions and corrections that seemed pertinent to me during my reading. Specific comments: Lines 135-136: The presentation of PC and NMDS analyses is confusing in terms of result interpretation because they do not complement each other, as mentioned in the text.

A main target of antibiotics is the bacterial ribosome. To address the problem of antibiotic resistance in the clinic, Mesa et. al. isolated different Pseudomonas aeruginosa’s strains from cystic fibrosis patients over 8 years that displayed resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. They conducted genomic sequencing and discovered these isolates contain a 12 nucleotide deletion in the rpflF gene that encodes the universal large subunit ribosomal protein 6 (uL6). This mutation has previously been reported in the paper by Halfon et al. (2019) which includes the structural comparison between the mutant and wild type ribosome. In this manuscript the authors determined “~86 ribosomal structures” structures of mutant and wild-type ribosomes with different antibiotics using single particle cryoEM to understand how resistance develops in these mutants. Their main results indicated the uL6 mutation rewires the ribosome conformational landscape and displays resistance to aminoglycosides. Their study confirmed canonical binding sites for aminoglycosides, but new binding sites were discovered for tobramycin in the uL6 mutants. Most importantly, the uL6 mutants displayed a tradeoff between aminoglycoside resistance and chloramphenicol sensitivity, dubbed as collateral sensitivity. In summary, this article provided an in depth structural analysis of antibiotics complexed with the ribosome from clinically relevant antibiotic resistant bacteria, however, there are a few major and minor concerns that we would like the authors to address. Major points. Would it be possible to structurally rationalize why uL6 is more ordered in closed conformation of ribosome and not in the open conformation in case of the mutant? and the same for with and without antibiotics? Would it be possible to make a 1:1 comparison between the uL6 densities in mutant and wildtype datasets for different classes? In the current version of the manuscript we couldn’t see a figure showing the uL6 density in wild-type datasets except in Ro1 class. Could the authors observe any density for uL6 in reconstructions from RC, RT and RK datasets and how does it differ (or not) from the respective mutant classes? (Note: it is difficult to interpret whether uL6 is well ordered or not from supplementary figure S4) How is H69 affected by the uL6 mutation? What are the structural features that connect these two which can prove that the retracted and stretched conformations of H69 are a cause of uL6 apart from the fact that they only exist in the L6M dataset? Could you explain this for example, by looking at the interactions that connect H69 and uL6 mutation region in WT structure? In Fig3B-I, where uL6 is shown to act like a wrist band, it is unclear how the allostery actually manifests structurally. We don’t really have a specific interaction map for R vs L ribosomes such that we can get to know how the interactions are altered in L which then leads to AGA inhibition/CHL sensitivity. Having something like a chord plot showing key interactions that regulate allostery and then highlighting specific interactions that are affected in L ribosome datasets will help. The authors termed a specific part of the 23S rRNA as “50S vulnerable region” because they could see that there was an increase in the flexibility of this region. It is unclear how this flexibility was quantified and what the reference was in quantifying it (i.e. it is flexible in comparison to what?). It is also a bit confusing where exactly this region is located since figure 2F is quite cluttered. There can be two figures, one showing the r proteins and the other just showing the vulnerable region. It would be useful if the authors could highlight the PTC in figure 2F since the proximity of “50S vulnerable region” to PTC is not very obvious. For example H95 which is part of SRL, lies ~60-65Å away from the PTC. The authors use Ro1 structure as a reference even for analysis of L6M datasets. The reason stated for this selection is that it represents the most abundant class of apo R ribosome and that it is the extreme opposite in terms of both antibiotics bound and presence of uL6 mutation. Although this is true, we feel Lo1 is still probably the “true reference” for the L6M datasets because all the structures bound to the antibiotics have the uL6 mutation. And so it would still be useful to look at the differences between Ro1 and Lo1 followed by re-running the analysis by using Lo1 as a reference instead of Ro1. To improve the overall analysis, the authors should consider combining all data sets and process it as a single dataset so as to obtain a more coherent understanding of the structural changes. This would provide a clearer representation of the latent space and the population differences. CryoDRGN generated maps should then be compared to assess if the conformational distribution is still similar to what has been obtained in the current version of the manuscript. This would be helpful in addressing the potential for generating maps based just on the latent space, focusing on the characteristics that differentiate different states and potentially revealing previously unseen conformational states. We feel that the musical analogy in figure 7E forms a cryptic model because A) It requires an inherent understanding of musical terminologies which is not ideal, and B) We are not sure what the authors exactly mean by retuning and detuning of the conformational landscape as R, L, LK, LT have different conformational landscapes, but the authors assign these to notes that are in ‘harmony’ as explained in the discussion (section titled “the well-temepred ribosome”) which is confusing. Another point regarding the musical analogy is that the terms ‘in-tune’ and ‘out of tune’ should be with reference to a specific property. In principle, it should be based on the conformational landscape but that doesn’t hold true as mentioned above. If this is in reference only to the growth curves, then it means that the structural results haven’t been addressed in the final model. We therefore feel that the authors should come up with a simpler model that is easier to understand and yet includes the results from structures. The authors include the paper by Halfon et al. (2019) in their list of references (23), but perhaps should also include a bit more on the discoveries of that paper and what the unresolved questions were motivating this paper in the introduction. Minor points. There may be a typo about universally conserved nucleotides in the decoding center between E. coli vs P. aeruginosa. (on page 9, line “...the universally E.coli conserved nucleotides A1486 and A1487…” these are supposed to be A1492 and A1493 for E.coli and A1486 and A1487 for P.aeruginosa.) When the term “allosteric activator” is used (in the abstract), it should refer to a series of correlated structural changes due to binding of Tobramycin. This is not explained in the paper. How can we say that the existence of 5 binding sites is a result of “allosteric activation” when there is no explanation about how the different binding sites structurally affect each other (even 2 out of 5)? The color coding for the two antibiotics (T/K - red and CHL - gray) can be seen in the legend but not in figure 7b, . Here, we see the distributions for WT and L6M dataset but not for the datasets with the two antibiotics. Do they superimpose? In figure 4a, please define the color coding in the legend for uL6. Figure citation missing on page 9 (“..the sharp kink observed in the retracted H69 helix eliminates the interactions with h44.”). We are not sure why the LT conformational space is larger than L in Figure 7D because the L dataset clearly had more heterogeneity. Could the authors explain this? The distribution figures presented in the paper could be streamlined to convey the main points more effectively. The authors should clarify the meaning of the left and right distributions, as well as their percentages based on total particles. Considering the potential differences in the data set, displaying the particle distribution on a logarithmic scale could provide a more accurate representation. - Tushar Raskar, Mohamad Dandan and James Fraser",2023-09-10T02:32:25,tushar_r,Tushar R.,10.1101/2023.06.13.544509,Detuning of the Ribosome Conformational Landscape Promotes Antibiotic Resistance and Collateral Sensitivity,"Pablo Mesa, Alicia Jiménez-Fernández, Ruggero La Rosa, Rocio Espinosa, Helle Krogh Johansen, Søren Molin, Guillermo Montoya",2023-06-13

This review resulted from the graduate-level course ""How to Read and Evaluate Scientific Papers and Preprints"" from the University of São Paulo, which aimed to provide students with the opportunity to review scientific articles, develop critical and constructive discussions on the endless frontiers of knowledge, and understand the peer review process. In this preprint Veryard et al. points out that for the past 25 years, ecological research has shown that biodiversity positively impacts ecosystem functions like biomass production when other variables are constant. Earlier experiments focused on grassland plant communities, but newer ones indicate similar benefits in plantations and forests. There's been limited research in tropical environments. This study presents preliminary results from a field-scale experiment in southeast Asia, examining the role of tree species diversity in restoring lowland tropical rainforests. Findings from Sabah, Malaysian Borneo suggest that active restoration, such as tree planting, accelerates forest recovery. This recovery is even more pronounced when using a diverse mix of tree species. The Sabah Biodiversity Experiment, conducted in the Malua forest reserve, involves different restoration methods on 500 ha of logged tropical forest. Observations reveal that the restoration is most effective when a diverse set of tree species is used for replanting. The study supports the idea that the positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning seen in other ecosystems also exists in SE Asia's lowland tropical rainforests. The data are reported in a clear way and the manuscript is well written. Data are consistent with the currently existing literature. Comments ●	About the soil preparation or pre-planting methods, it was highlighted that in one of the treatments the removal of lianas was used. Therefore, it would be interesting to highlight whether controls such as leaf-cutting ants, termites and weeds, fertilization methods and soil correction methods were used or not, even as standard for all treatments. ●	Perhaps the objective of the experiment was not to identify the diversity of species more than 10 years after planting, but considering that there was a survey of data in the field to compare the information from the satellite analysis, it would be interesting to obtain such information to also show that species diversity still exists in the places, since this is also a relevant indicator to consider areas as restored. In addition, this indicator can help to identify potentially monodominant species or even to identify the optimal number of species to be planted to maintain a desired final diversity. ●	It would also be important to highlight in the text the density of individuals planted per area, to reinforce that the increase in the indexes analyzed originated to the diversity of species and not just to a large density of individuals planted per area.",2023-09-06T14:50:01,jefersonlealsilva,Jeferson Leal Silva,10.1101/2022.09.09.507141,Positive effects of tree diversity on tropical forest restoration in a field-scale experiment,"Ryan Veryard, Jinhui Wu, Michael J.

By the expression of the following differential biomarkers, these populations can be divided into two: melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), cocaine, and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART); and orexin, oxytocin, and vasopressin. Excitotoxicity is commonly seen in the population of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum and is the main cause of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease. On the other hand, the nature of the neurodegenerative process found in the hypothalamus remains unknown. Thus, the author's objective was to evaluate the relationship of quinolinic acid (QA)-mediated excitotoxicity in the hypothalamic regions of wild-type and transgenic HD mouse models. Below are my comments about the work: I would like to suggest the authors to remove the term “fatal” or replace it with “progressive” in the abstract and introduction. The fatality, or lethality, results from the knockout of the huntingtin gene ( https://doi.org/10.1242/dev..., while greater numbers of CAG repetition relative to huntingtin’s mutation and homozygote allele are related to early manifestations of symptoms and several clinical courses, respectively ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/W... https://doi.org/10.1093/bra.... In the introduction, I suggest the authors to modify the phrase “Excitotoxicity, i.e., excessive stimulation of the glutamate receptor, …”, as it is glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. This is because excitotoxicity can be conceptualized as cytotoxicity caused by increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations (DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.13-05-02085.1993). Therefore, excitotoxicity can be glutamate-dependent and -independent. We can also observe excitotoxicity when calcium concentrations increase by other pathways that are independent of glutamate receptors. In both cases, there will be a loss of the cell's ability to reestablish the homeostatic balance of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0903546106). In the conclusion topic, I think that could be interesting to further exploring the data obtained from selective excitotoxicity for the MCH-positive neurons. I say this because, although there is no amplification of the QA-induced excitotoxicity effect in the transgenic animals, the observation that the same neurons (i.e., the MCH-positive neurons) naturally undergo neurodegeneration seems to me an indication that the affected neuronal populations can die by different mechanisms; being, however, the MCH-positive neuronal cell death, probably, related to the glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. Thus, the hypothesis that the MCH-positive neuronal population is selectively affected by the glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity cannot be ruled out.",2023-09-05T17:39:31,lucasbonfimmarques,Lucas Bonfim Marques,10.1101/2021.04.08.439100,Effects of excitotoxicity in the hypothalamus in transgenic mouse models of Huntington disease,"Jo B.

The study ""Pain reflects the informational value of nociceptive inputs"" by Michel-Pierre Coll et al. examines the potentiality for the central nervous system to optimize pain’s learning function by being modulated by pain perception. Moreover, the author's hypothesized that nociceptive processing could be augmented when pain is surprising to facilitate predictive learning about pain. To see if this occurs, the authors record nociceptive flexion reflex amplitude combined with electroencephalography to link nociceptive flexion reflex modulation with the influx of ascending nociceptive signals to the cortex. On the electroencephalography they use two indices of expected pain. The first is the late positive potential (peaks around 400-600 ms after the pain-predictive cue). The second is a decrease of oscillatory power in the alpha and beta bands. This seems to be a very powerful take on how pain learning is associated with the expectation of pain. And the combinations of different methods of recording the perception of pain is a novelty in this area, combining the recording of nociceptive flexion reflex modulation amplitude with electroencephalography to link the modulation with the influx of ascending nociceptive information to the cortex. That way the authors can distinguish between the nociceptive responses and perception of pain in the participants and that the predictions errors between anticipated predictions and actual outcomes are associated with the nociceptive flexion reflex. The procedure of the experiment is very well delineated and explained in the text. The statistical analysis is very well explained and appropriate for the problem in hand. Then again, the authors did not specify why they use the three computational models that they choose to use. Although those three computational models are frequently used in studies about uncertainty in perception takes in volatile environments, the justification for their uses are intrinsically different. The justification for the use of a computational model must be a priori unless the study is about the models themselves. All that said, the interpretation for the basis why the Rescorla-Wagner model provided a better fit for the data is very good. Maintaining the environmental volatility relatively high and constant throughout the task due to the regular introduction of new cues is a very good way of simulating actual environmental conditions. Also, they did not say why they used thirty-five participants. Is always recommended to do a pilot to calculate effect and sample size or to justify this quantity from the literature or previous works from the group, published or not. It is argued that this is good enough to reach meaningful conclusions in this specific case. A limitation of this study is the dependence on the connection of the electroencephalography markers used for pain processing to aversive prediction errors that still don't have strong evidence in the literature. The authors make that clear in the text. Meanwhile, combining electroencephalography with functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional near-infrared spectroscopy may give more insights and give more evidence on pain processing to aversive prediction. The results of prediction errors being associated with increased pain perception and physiological pain responses and also with increased anticipatory cortical responses shows that this study is well done and very promising reliability and validity.",2023-09-01T16:20:46,disqus_IhM3mGPyfe,Bernard Costa,10.1101/2023.07.14.549006,Pain reflects the informational value of nociceptive inputs,"Michel-Pierre Coll, Zoey Walden, Pierre-Alexandre Bourgoin, Véronique Taylor, Pierre Rainville, Manon Robert, Dang Khoa Nguyen, Pierre Jolicoeur, Mathieu Roy",2023-07-18

Indeed, current pipelines of defensome analysis (DefenseFinder, Padloc) do not provide sufficient HMMs representative of the large diversity of these systems. They currently mainly focus on PsyrTA, RosmerTA, SanaTA and ShosTA with proven antiphage activity, and argue that ""Toxin-Antitoxin have not been included yet, as there is still some controversy if all members of such families are involved in anti-phage defense"". While the latter is true, there is currently in my view room for the inclusion of more families. Personally, I think that one of the reasons on why this has been delayed, relates partially to the high turnover and dN/dS of several TA genes, which makes it more tricky to build strong HMM models. The latter is something in which our group is actively working at for the eventual release of future analysis tools. In the case of this paper we have stated that our analyses are clearly underestimating the abundance of defense families (for reasons that are highlighted in the Discussion section), but we will definitely make sure to highlight the particular point of TAs (adding appropriate references).

We also thank you for citing three papers from our group. However, I am leaving this comment because our papers were not adequately nor accurately cited in your manuscript. First, we have already shown that asymmetric tension decides a budding direction in J Phys Chem B 126 (2022): 453-462 using our simulations. This is consistent with your findings, and none of your text mentioned this. Second, we have already carried out a large-scale coarse-grained simulation of lipid droplet biogenesis with seipin, published in Elife 11 (2022): e75808. This includes not only nucleation but also maturation and budding. We have further found and discussed the critical role of seipin transmembrane segments in maintaining a neck structure. In particular, based on our simulations, we proposed a mutant construct, which was further validated by experiment in our paper. The final structure of our CG molecular dynamics simulations is consistent with the experimental structure.  In that regard, our work has been cited in your paper only for nucleation but did not receive proper credit for budding and maturation. In particular, we disagree with the following two sentences in your manuscript: ""The function of seipin is also not completely clear: simulations and experiments suggested that it may trap triglycerides (13-15), therefore affecting LD nucleation and growth by ripening, but its localization at the LD-ER contact site raises questions on a possible role also in the budding process.” ""LD nucleation and phase separation were observed in simulations before (7,13,22,23,38), and occur on fast time scales (below the microsecond); in contrast, the budding process has never been observed so far, neither in simulations nor experimentally."" I hope our concerns are properly addressed during revision so that we do not have to write a comment to the journal in which your paper will be published. Thank you.

We collectively agreed it’s an exciting contribution to our understanding of how urbanization reshapes bird communities and their traits. During our discussion, a major point of debate was the ability of the Urban Association Index (UAI) to capture fundamental aspects of urban tolerance. The supplementary material explains important details on how this metric was obtained, but a few questions remained after our discussion. In particular, as the number of records has the potential to influence the mean UAI, widespread, very common species – even if they are equally common in cities and rural areas – may exhibit high UAI mean because most of the records from eBird come from urban areas (i.e., sampling bias). In this scenario, UAI may be amplified for abundant and/or eye-catching species. Perhaps the authors could check the correlation between mean UAI and the number of records to see the nature of this relationship. In this same line of thought, it might be opportune to explore how UAI varies across native vs. invasive species. We understand the reasoning for not differentiating native vs. exotic species (lines 114-116), but for species that were recently introduced through pet trade (e.g., Yellow-crested Cockatoo, Monk Parakeet - which are among those with the highest UAI values), not necessarily UAI is measuring tolerance to urbanization, particularly when their native habitats are not represented in the dataset. We also discussed that a possible approach to illuminate the biological meaning of UAI would be looking at the relationship between mean UAI and variance in UAI. Figure S5 shows how variance varies across species, apparently independent from the mean UAI. In this perspective, for instance, species with high UAI and high variance in UAI tend to be highly associated with cities but also occur in non-urban areas. In turn, species with high UAI and low variance in UAI are strict to cities, and so on. Congrats on the manuscript, and good luck with the next steps of this work!

In this preprint, the authors describe and discuss the structure of a Glycerol-3-phosphate Acyltransferase (GPAT) called PlsB. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the authors have successfully elucidated the complete structure of PlsB from Themomonas haemolytica (ThPlsB). The structural study revealed that ThPlsB forms a symmetric homodimer with three distinct domains in each monomer: the amino-terminal domain (NTD), the middle catalytic domain (MCD), and the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). Additionally, the study identified binding sites for a fatty acyl-CoA molecule and a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DOPA) molecule within the MCD of PlsB. It was also demonstrated that interactions between ThPlsB and the cell membrane involves two exposed amphipathic regions on the surface, located in the NTD and MCD. Based on structural and biochemical analyses, the authors propose a model in which PlsB associates with the membrane surface, coupling its catalytic activity to the biosynthesis of lysophosphatidic acid at the interface between the cell membrane and the cytosol. The data and hypotheses are well presented and written clearly and concisely, and it is an excellent piece of work that provides a new and significant perspective on the structure of PlsB. Major comments ● The outcomes are adeptly presented, offering the reader lucid and succinct comprehension. The executed experiments display a high level of proficiency, and the employed controls that were fittingly selected. This informative exploration of PlsB elucidates numerous structural facets of the enzyme. ● This work provides an excellent insight into the importance of the CTD, NTD, and MCD domains and offers an initial understanding of the aspects mediating the enzyme's interaction with the membrane. There are limitations in CryoEM that prevent the study of the protein bound to lipid bilayers, which justifies the use of micelles and the addition of DOPA. However, considering that the association of PlsB with the membrane is essential for its catalytic activity and that the bilayer association potentially could induce structural changes in the enzyme, possibly even in the active site, I believe that the study could be further enriched by incorporating methodologies aimed at analyzing the impacts on the structure and the aforementioned domains resulting from the protein's binding to LUVs lipid bilayers. ● In addition to the points mentioned earlier it would add value to the manuscript the characterization of the enzymatic activity in the presence of lipid bilayers as well. This would allow for the analysis of how the bilayer and its curvature influence the activity of both the wild-type enzyme and the mutants. Minor comments ● To provide a clearer context for introducing PlsY in the introduction, it might be beneficial to offer more explanatory information. The way it's currently presented could potentially confuse the reader. ● Including a figure illustrating the pathway and highlighting the position of PlsB could greatly enhance the reader's comprehension and appreciation of its importance. ● It could be interesting to perform enzymatic assays with acyl-ACP, another substrate of PlsB. ● The figure 6 could be improved in terms of clarity and didactic presentation in order to most adequately convey and summarize the discussed information to the reader.",2023-08-30T14:42:33,samuelguimarescostapereira,Samuel Guimarães Costa Pereira,10.1101/2023.04.30.538836,"The phospholipid biosynthesis enzyme PlsB contains three distinct domains for membrane association, lysophosphatidic acid synthesis and dimerization","Yumei Li, Anjie Li, Zhenfeng Liu",2023-04-30

Very cool to hear that this preprint was discussed as a part of a graduate course. You raised some very important and interesting points.  Here are some comments on some of them. ○ Indeed,  it would be interesting to look specifically at the BER pathway, being so vital in the repair of oxidative damage; We do have plans to look at PARP1. In the meantime we have performed sequencing and mutational analysis, which confirmed that mitochondrial H2O2 release indeed does not increase the mutation load, while H2O2 production at the histones did. We will include this in the final version of the paper. ○ We recently obtained data showing that the mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration was not impaired to presence or activation of TOM20-DAAO. So it does seem that mitochondrial function is not impaired. We will include it in the final version. ○ I also agree looking at mitochondrial DNA is just as interesting as nuclear DNA, and we are currently working on this. I will make sure that we define more clearly whether we are looking at nuclear or mitochondrial DNA in the final story. The remaining point you make are also valid. Thank you for the feedback; It shows how valuable sharing your work on preprint servers can be. We will incorporate these comments in the final version of the story!",2023-08-30T11:51:03,daanvansoest,Daan van Soest,10.1101/2023.03.29.534749,Mitochondrial H2O2 release does not directly cause genomic DNA damage,"Daan M.K. van Soest, Paulien E.
