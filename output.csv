While it is commendable that such effects have been observed and quantified with apparent robustness, this aspect alone does not compensate for the overall weaknesses of the study. The significance of this autoactivation in fruit metamorphosis, as discussed, is exaggerated. Techniques such as imaging quantification and single-cell analysis are utilized, yet they seem to function more as ornamental enhancements rather than providing substantial contributions to the core narrative. For instance, the imaging quantification primarily shows proliferation within the stomatal lineages but fails to delve deeper into the overall growth mechanisms influencing fruit shape. Additionally, the single-cell analysis appears to be inadequately executed in several aspects. A thorough reporting and discussion on the robustness of observations involving transgenic lines, such as GUS reporters, inducible lines, and mutants, is sorely missing. This is crucial, especially considering the minimal phenotypical effects of the cis-regulatory element under investigation. A detailed analysis is needed to ascertain whether the observed effects are indeed significant or simply artifacts stemming from genetic background noise. Lastly, the selection analysis presented in Supplementary Figure 26 is conceptually flawed and should be reconsidered. The approach of segregating sequences with and without the binding site (BS) before analysis is fundamentally problematic. Selecting species that carry the BS and then asserting high conservation within this group compared to others is tautological and compromises the scientific integrity of the findings.",2024-04-23T12:36:47,alessandropopoli,Alessandro Popoli,10.1101/2024.02.23.581830,SHOOTMERISTEMLESS autoactivation: A prerequisite for fruit metamorphosis,"Yang Dong, Zhi-Cheng Hu, Mateusz Majda, Hao-Ran Sun, Yao Zhang, Yi-Ning Ding, Quan Yuan, Tong-Bing Su, Tian-Feng Lü, Feng Gao, Gui-Xia Xu, Richard S.

Our current data have revealed the fact that when we mutate ZF5 we lose specificity to Zelda's highest affinity motifs, and it goes to new sites where it drives activity (see Fig. 1, 6 and associated supplements). Additionally, SMT (Fig. 2) shows that interaction kinetics are also severely perturbed.  Together with the hub relocalization (Fig.5) data and clear trends in where the ZF5 mutant goes to (Fig. 6), our conclusion that there is fine-balance of interactions (protein-DNA and protein-protein) - not just specific DNA motif recognition- that dictate TF occupancy and hub localization is well supported. -Regarding the SMT data, papers in the field use a variety of approaches on reporting replicates, so the statement that there is a “correct” way is a bit misleading. To maximize the ability of readers to interpret our results, in this manuscript we have reported data in a variety of ways, from single embryo replicates, to aggregate data, and perform statistical testing in two different orthogonal manners. We ask that the commentator please refer to the figure captions, materials and methods, and supplementary material in more detail. We appreciate that our rigor in reporting may not have been clear, and we will include a summary statistics table in an updated pre-print after we consolidate more comments. -Regarding Figure 4E, we also refer the commenter to the figure caption and materials and methods where we detail what statistical tests we use and also consider the fact that just because there is “overlap” doesn’t mean statistically significant differences don’t exist. In brief: we performed Kruskal-Wallis test for overall group differences and Mann-Whitney U tests for pairwise comparisons. Given that our data was not normally distributed (as confirmed using Shapiro-Wilk test), we choose these tests as they are non-parametric and can handle large sample sizes (N = 5,758 hubs in ZLD and 1,770 hubs in ZF5). Additionally, we have sub-sampled our data to compare an even sample size between ZLD and ZF5 (data not shown). These subsampling tests also resulted in the same statistical significance results as shown in the figure.",2024-04-22T17:59:55,disqus_y7mGm6zKxr,Mustafa Mir,10.1101/2024.04.16.589811,A fine kinetic balance of interactions directs transcription factor hubs to genes,"Apratim Mukherjee, Samantha Fallacaro, Puttachai Ratchasanmuang, Joseph Zinski, Alan Boka, Kareena Shankta, Mustafa Mir",2024-04-16

The presence of I2a-L699 in Yassitepe (Lazaridis 2023), and its persistence into the Iron Age is clear testament to this. Contra to the analysis offered in L. et al (2023), that lineage is not a Balkan lineage - missing in all pre Bronze Age samples (Mathieson 2015, Penske 2023, Lazaridis 2023)- but from further north, esp the Dnipro valley, and more proximately Cernavoda C.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.04.578794v1#comment-6439261636,biorxivstage,0,"Summary: Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a GTP binding/ protein-crosslinking enzyme with therapeutic potential in various conditions such as cancers, Celiac disease, and neurological disorders. TG2 is thought to have two major conformational states, an inactive GTP-bound closed state and a crosslinking-active Ca2+-bound open state. Other groups have previously reported X-ray structures of TG2 that reveal the structural basis for the regulation of transamidation activity by GTP/GDP and Ca2+. Although these studies have suggested that guanine nucleotides and Ca2+ allosterically regulate TG2 activity by inducing global conformational changes, direct evidence for conformational transitions has been lacking so far. The authors of this paper have previously shown that a small-molecule inhibitor, TTGM 5826, inhibits the protein crosslinking activity of TG2 by stabilizing the open conformation. Interestingly, TTGM 5826 prevented the growth of cancer cells which led the authors to conclude that the open conformation is cytotoxic. Therefore, locking TG2 in the open state by small molecules could lead to new therapeutic strategies. In this study, the authors have investigated how the binding of guanine nucleotides, calcium, and small-molecule inhibitors affects the open and closed conformational states of TG2 using small- angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). Additionally, they focused on the discovery of improved small molecule inhibitors compared to TTGM 5826. The major success of this paper is the finding that TG2 can undergo a reversible conformational transition in solution between closed and open states under physiological GTP and Ca2+ concentrations. In addition, the authors have found a new conformational state inhibitor, LM11, that is more potent than TTGM 5826, although the evidence to support the connection between drug potency and TG2 conformational specificity in cells is weak. The authors show that the LM11-bound state has a different conformation from the Ca2+-bound open state. The major weakness of this paper is the lack of mechanistic information to explain the potency of LM11. Hopefully further structural studies will provide further details on the conformational changes induced by LM11 and other inhibitors. Major points: In Figure 3D, the authors explained the different conformations between WT and the R580K mutant under GTP conditions by Kratky plots and fitting using CRYSOL. A Kratky plot normalized by Rg may be a better way to discuss the conformations since normalized Kratky plots emphasize conformational differences. In such a plot the weak shoulder in around q = 0.15Å-1 of “open dimer”, which likely comes from the dimer conformation's symmetry, can then be emphasized and discussed. In the text regarding Figure 4, the authors mentioned 3DFSC but it is not provided in the figures. 3DFSC is one of most important plots in cryo-EM analysis to verify directional resolution and density isotropy. In Figure 4A, the authors said that the homology model generated from TG3 was an excellent fit for the map under Ca2+ conditions. Considering Figure S2, the fit looks excellent certainly. But it was just a visual evaluation, and quantitative scores to validate the degree of fitness like the Q score should be provided. In the text mentioning Figure 4B, the authors said “a homology model of TG2 bound to Ca2+ at the three conserved binding sites and found that it was in good agreement with the cryo-EM map”. However, this sentence does not seem to match the figure because Figure 4B shows the calcium-binding sites and the related residues in the model, not including the cryo-EM map. Therefore, we suggest that Figure S2 which shows how the calcium-binding sites fit the map is included in Figure 4 instead of Figure 4B. In Figure 4, SAXS and Cryo-EM under Ca2+ conditions showed different conformations based on each protein concentration. Do you have information about the concentration of TG2 in human cells and how this relates to regulation? The authors explained that TG2 R580K mutant forms higher-order oligomers at lower Ca2+ concentrations compared to WT TG2 from Figure 4. However, at this stage, proof that WT TG2 forms higher-order oligomers seems to be only the I(0) value of the red SAXS profile in Figure 4C. In addition, since the profile is well-fitted to the calculated open-dimer profile, readers might not notice the increased I(0) value. Figure S7B looks like a more direct proof of WT TG2 higher-order oligomers under Ca2+ conditions. Therefore, we suggest that Figure S7B is included in Figure 4 or is mentioned in the text related to Figure 4. In general, SAXS has technical limitations in confirming the presence of oligomeric species due to the possibility of non-specific aggregates, precipitates, and buffer components scattering at low q values. Addressing these sources of low q scattering either through explicit mention in the text or furnishing more direct evidence of the TG2 oligomers may enhance the strength of the claims. The authors mention that using 3 μM TG2 in cryo-EM made it possible to capture monomeric TG2. The SAXS experiments required higher concentrations (25 μM) for sufficient signal. Given the importance of TG2 dimers in this study, the authors might consider measuring the affinity constant for self-association to confirm that the stoichiometry (homodimer/monomer) in the different experiments is indeed what they expect based on the solution behavior of TG2. Can the authors explain the significance of the differences in fluorescence emission at each arrow point for no drug vs. LM11 treatment in the BODIPY-GTP binding assays in Figure 5A? Some discussion regarding the limitations in using two cell lines that possibly differ in expression levels of genes other than TG2, membrane permeability, metabolic activities etc. to assess LM11 potency, can align the conclusions more closely with the data. Minor points: Table S2 is not mentioned in the text. In Figure 3D,  it is better to describe what concentration of GTP the experimental curves have clearly. Certainly, we can read those based on the values of Rg in Figures 2 and 3B but that’s a bit unfriendly. There seems to be a typo in the text of Figure 4C. “yellow, see Figure S3C” looks like the correct text because Figure 3C does not include SAXS profiles. Figures 2 and 3 can be combined to make it easier for the reader to compare between TG2 WT and R580K. The term “saturated conformational state” in the legend for Figure 3B is not meaningful.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.29.587336v1#comment-6438521343,biorxivstage,0,"It's great that the authors have put together a manuscript that aims to generate data on an important but often ignored question in cell biology on a neglected clade. I have a few questions regarding their methods listed below, where I could not replicate or understand their choices. If I'm reading the methods correctly the authors have used two sets of primers to amplify two transcripts from cDNA: PAPYR_7259 (P7) and PAPYR_8006 (P8). They then clone these into an expression vector to generate antibodies that they've used for some IF and a pulldown. Importantly PAPYR_7259 has several strong interpro domains corresponding to subunits of ubiquitin activating E1 domains that each hit 4-5 different genes, so the antibody specificity will be dependent on which epitopes were available in the expression vector and their antigenicity. In an effort to understand whether the authors have used a truncated protein with just the SFA domains or the whole protein including the ubiquitin interacting domains I looked for primer binding sites within each gene. I BLASTed the primers against the genome, and found binding sites for the PAPYR_7259 Fwd/Rev primers that would amplify a region from 232645 - 233620 within the genome that is near the start/stop codons of 232642 - 240693. This suggests that they are taking nearly the whole protein including the N-term Ubiquitin activating E1 domains, could the authors confirm this is the case? As for PAPYR_8006 the Fwd primer bind in the region of 147480, however I was entirely unable to find a hit by BLASTn for the listed reverse primer (GCTAGCGGCCGCATGGGTGATGACGTGGAGGCCGTCCTG) against any Paratrimastix genome in Genbank. It’s possible that the authors are using their own genome sequence, however this should be included as data within the paper and should be acknowledged in their methods. It may also be that the authors are using this primer to do a Gibson assembly so we would expect it to be less homologous to the paratrimastix pyriformis genome, however this is not explained in the methods either, and the 6-8bp 5’ non-homologous regions of the other primers suggests to me that this is simple enzyme cloning, and can all be located by BLAST. Could the authors please double check that the sequence in the text is correct and double check where it binds, and which genome version they’re using? The authors also mention that they validated their antibodies by Western Blot, however the data is not present in the paper, it would be excellent to include that data, even if it’s just as a supplemental figure. The authors then conduct expansion and Immunofluorescent microscopy to localize the SFAs within this unique organism. While expansion produces very pretty images, the authors do not include non-expanded cells, and given the difficulties of working with expanded cells and how little is known about Paratrimastix sp. it is important that the authors also show any data that they might have to show the same binding pattern is similar in non-expanded cells. I know too in our lab we've had difficulties getting DAPI/hoescht to work well with expansion but no issues with regular IF, so that inclusion would be great. Notably too the authors do not show P7 IF staining, it would be good to look at the localization of both SFAs, not just one, and this may be simpler to do in non-expanded cells.",2024-04-17T20:01:01,,Christopher Hart,10.1101/2024.03.29.587336,Striated fibre assemblins localise in the feeding groove of the ‘typical excavate’ Paratrimastix pyriformis,"Aaron A.

This has an advantage over using detergents such as CHAPSO, because the target protein concentration can remain lower. It seems like this would be a straightforward method to implement for challenging specimens and therefore should be of broad interest. We would find it helpful if the authors could provide more methodological detail in the manuscript, especially given it is a methods-based paper. For example, when was LEA added to the samples? What concentration was the stock solution of LEA? Is glycerol necessary for LEA protein stability? The manuscript would be strengthened by investigation into the mechanistic basis of how LEA proteins improve particle quality. The authors hypothesize that LEA coats the air-water interface and could further investigate this. The orientation bias of the samples in this study suggests that the sample proteins are still interacting with an interface. Tomography could help explain these. It would also be interesting to know if the authors attempted to reconstruct crosslinked PRC2 in the absence of LEA (as a control, instead of comparing to other laboratories' work).",2024-04-12T16:25:56,lori_passmore,Lori Passmore,10.1101/2024.02.06.579238,Small LEA proteins as an effective air-water interface protectant for fragile samples during cryo-EM grid plunge freezing,"Kaitlyn M.

Results: Strengths: -Easy to follow. Great figures, well organized. Potential Improvements: -We suggest moving figure 1a-b to a separate figure. -It would be more useful to consider cell averages across more replicates. Some experiments only had N=1 biological replicates, which we only found in the legends - these would be appreciated on the figures themselves in cases where we were comparing between groups (figure 3a control and b2-KO, e.g.). -Sufficient replicates were not always performed to make robust statistical comparisons.

Indeed, the correct interpretation is that the enrichment-based methods allow inter- and not intra- sample comparison. A very nice explanation is from Nadel et all 2021 quoted here ""Also included in this study are four signature quantification tools, which include DCQ, MCP-Counter, SaVanT and xCell [9, 11, 12, 27]. These tools operate by calculating scores intended to correspond to the relative abundance of each cell type across samples. These scores should not be interpreted as fractions and are, in fact, often unbounded and sum to values >1.0. Although scores for a particular cell type can be compared across samples, comparisons of scores across cell types may not be valid. For example, a sample with a higher score for B cells compared with natural killer (NK) cells does not imply that there are more B cells than NK cells present. The tools MCP-Counter and SaVanT generate signature scores by calculating the log-sum of a set of marker genes [11, 27].""",2024-04-10T11:27:08,disqus_j8HB2aFhOJ,Anna Vathrakokoili Pournara,10.1101/2023.01.19.523443,CATD: A reproducible pipeline for selecting cell-type deconvolution methods across tissues,"Anna Vathrakokoili Pournara, Zhichao Miao, Ozgur Yilmaz Beker, Nadja Nolte, Alvis Brazma, Irene Papatheodorou",2023-11-07

The dataset is impressive, the methods are outstanding, and the results are robust and relevant. However, in our opinion, the manuscript does not fully clarify whether environmental similarity between relatives affects phenotypic heritability versus phenotypic heritability estimates of the animal model. This clarification is crucial for interpretation of the results obtained by anyone fitting similar models. In other words, are the estimates after accounting for environmental similarity the 'correct' values for the trait’s heritability (implying that otherwise, they would be overestimated, and environmental similarity only affects heritability estimates but not heritability per se)? Or, when accounting for environmental similarity, do heritability estimates reflect the heritability after controlling for environmental inheritance (i.e., environmental similarity does affect heritability and its effects are statically removed when fitted in the model, resulting in an underestimation of total heritability)? We believe that this topic could be better addressed, by referring to recent theoretical work presented in Munar-Delgado et al. 2023 ( https://doi.org/10.1111/204.... Here we showed how heritability is affected by environmental similarity only when the environment itself is somehow inherited and affects the phenotypic trait via phenotypic plasticity. In such a scenario, the total heritability of the trait is the sum of the direct heritability (the inherited basis for the phenotypic trait) plus the indirect heritability (the direct inherited basis for the focal environment, proportional to the square of the strength of phenotypic plasticity). Thus, accounting for environmental similarity in the animal model statically removes those indirect effects. Both heritability estimates (when not accounting for environmental similarity and when doing so) are statistically 'correct' (unbiased) estimates. However, they do reflect different things biologically, and not considering this can bias their interpretation. As a side note, we think that the effect of environmental inheritance on the heritability of the phenotypic trait has the same outcome when the environment is genetically inherited (in the ms mentioned as ""If it results from a genetically mediated breeding environment choice, then this could actually be considered part of the 'genetic' heritability of the trait"") and when it is non-genetically inherited (in the ms mentioned as ""by assuming similarity in the environments used by individuals is driven purely by non-genetic""). Animal models estimate the proportion of the variation in the phenotype transmitted across generations. This variation can be both genetically and non-genetically transmitted. In this context, it might be helpful to talk about 'inclusive heritability' (Danchin and Wagner, 2010 - https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1... when referring to the heritability potentially affected by environmental similarity, which can be both genetically and non-genetically inherited (this includes environmental inheritance via limited dispersal). Overall, we would state that environmental similarity does increase heritability of the phenotypic trait if it is affected by a heritable environment (unlike the title of the ms that states that it decreases heritability). Once again, congratulations on your work, and we are happy to discuss this further if you wish.

A group of student editors synthesized the individual reviews into this PreReview. We hope that the authors and readers of this paper will find our comments useful! Introduction The paper, “Complete chromosome 21 centromere sequences from a Down syndrome family reveal size asymmetry and differences in kinetochore attachment,” delves into the role of centromere structure and epigenetic features of chromosome 21 (chr21) in contributing to Trisomy 21 (T21). Trisomy 21, clinically known as Down syndrome, is the most common autosomal chromosomal aneuploidy in humans, which is caused by the presence of an entire extra chromosome 21 in the affected individual. While there are multiple ways this syndrome can be inherited, the most common path is a nondisjunction of chromosomes during maternal meiosis I (MI) due to an error in segregation of chromosomes. Centromeres are crucial for the correct segregation of chromosomes during meiosis; thus, understanding their role and how their characteristics might contribute to nondisjunction of chromosome 21 is a current gap in knowledge. The authors hypothesized that genetic and epigenetic variation at the centromere of chromosome 21 can act as risk factors for chromosome 21 nondisjunction. Previously, centromeres sequences were inaccessible using short-read sequencing technologies. To overcome this limitation, the authors employed a variety of sequencing methods including Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) high-fidelity (HiFi) long read sequencing and ultra-long Oxford Nanopore Technologies (UL-ONT) along with ChIP-seq. Utilizing these technologies, the team sequenced and assembled centromeres from a parent-child trio, where the child, diagnosed with Down syndrome, exhibits three distinct chromosome 21 centromere haplotypes with significant size differences. Finally, the centromere variations in the T21 family were compared to a population sampling of 35 completely sequenced chromosome 21 centromeres from diverse ancestry, which revealed unique features of T21 centromeres, especially size asymmetry and epigenetic differences. The authors concluded that these findings suggest an impairment in the kinetochore formation that can lead to nondisjunction and T21; therefore, providing insights into Down syndrome’s molecular mechanism and emphasizing the importance of centromeric structure in chromosomal stability. Main Limitations The authors acknowledged several major limitations of the study, including the sampling of only one proband-parent trio and the exclusive use of transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines. Here, we elaborate on the significance of these limitations and introduce additional limitations for consideration by the authors. 1)	The sequencing of only one parent-proband trio is a major limitation of the study, given the heterogeneity in higher order repeat (HOR) array length and centromere dip region (CDR) methylation pattern found among the 35 previously assembled chromosome 21 centromeres. Although the results did show that the HOR array of one of the proband's maternally inherited chromosomes was significantly shorter than any HOR array from the control human population, it still cannot be assumed from one parent-child trio that this unusually short length or asymmetry in the mother increases the risk of nondisjunction and trisomy 21. The paternal sequencing data also showed centromere asymmetry, to a lesser extent than that of the mother, and without data from more trios, we are still left with the question of whether paternal asymmetry can also contribute to nondisjunction risk. Furthermore, some individuals, such as HG03710 in Figure 3C, also exhibit centromere HOR asymmetry and differential CDR methylation patterns across chromosome 21 centromere haplotypes. Thus, with the current data, it is difficult to distinguish between normal variation and variation associated with trisomy 21. Sampling only one trio is accompanied by yet another limitation specific to trisomy 21 – the mother’s age at conception was 29, which is not representative of the increased risk of trisomy 21 at maternal ages greater than 35. Finally, the of sampling only one trio, while very informative of the most common type of meiotic error leading to trisomy 21 (meiosis I, maternal), does not necessarily explain the mechanism by which other meiotic errors lead to trisomy 21. To make a well-supported conclusion about what genetic factors confer risk for trisomy 21, more parent-child trios would need to be analyzed. While we acknowledge the costs of long-read sequencing and the resources needed to carry it out, obtaining the sequencing data of just one or two additional trios could potentially provide more confidence that these epigenetic differences and asymmetry are conserved across cases of trisomy 21 and contribute to nondisjunction. 2)	The authors of the study extracted DNA from transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines rather than primary tissue material collected from the individuals. There is currently limited evidence on the genomic and epigenomic stability of these cells at the centromere. Repeating the analysis on DNA taken from primary culture, if possible, could bring certainty to the fact that the observed genetic and epigenetic features are associated with nondisjunction/trisomy 21, and not with the EBV transformation of these cells, for example. A broader analysis across cell types in the future could also remove epigenetic differences between cell lines as confounding variables. 3)	While the authors extensively characterized the centromeres of chromosome 21 in one case of trisomy 21 and identified variations in size, methylation patterns, and CENP-A enrichment, they did not directly demonstrate the functional significance of these differences in promoting chromosome 21 nondisjunction. To address this limitation, the authors could perform functional assays using cell lines or animal models to assess the impact of altered centromere structure and epigenetics on chromosome segregation and the occurrence of trisomy 21. These additional experiments would strengthen the study's conclusions and provide deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying trisomy 21. However, we understand that these kinds of functional experiments may not be the focus of the research group that carried out the study, and other research groups or collaborators may choose to complement their findings with functional experiments. 4)	Although the title of the paper claims that the sequencing of the chromosome 21 centromeres revealed “differences in kinetochore attachment”, there is no functional evidence of differences in kinetochore attachment provided in the paper. At several points throughout the manuscript the authors use more speculative language to refer to what can be gleaned about the kinetochore from their epigenetic results. For example, in the abstract: “these epigenetic signatures suggest less competent kinetochore attachment” and when referring to the CDR on p. 5, “the likely site of kinetochore attachment”, or on p. 7 “ thought to define the site of kinetochore attachment”. We recommend that the authors either remove this from the title, incorporate uncertainty into the title, or add additional experiments to the paper that would provide evidence for differences in kinetochore attachment. For example, ChIP-seq for other kinetochore proteins could bolster this claim. Minor Limitations While the paper mentioned several major limitations, there are also some minor limitations that we found relevant to the paper.  Minor limitations include recommendations for improved clarity and figure presentation. 1)	A brief statement elucidating the significance of the AluY retrotransposon insertion highlighted in the text would add clarity to its relevance. 2)	Furnishing more details about the controls, such as their geographic origin and diversity, would strengthen the study. We infer that the abbreviations in parenthesis next to the sample names in figure 4 refers to ancestry information, but it would be helpful to add these abbreviations in the figure legend. 3)	 The large size of the pedigree in Figure 1 made it challenging to discern the epigenetic profiles and heatmaps due to their small size; enlarging these elements or providing clearer delineation could address this issue. 4)	Integrating portions of supplemental figures 2 and 5, which compare the proband to the parents, as additional panels in the main figures, would emphasize differences in methylation patterns and CDR more effectively. 5)	Figures featuring numerous colors or intricate details, such as figures 2 and 3, could benefit from additional textual labeling or zooming in on key regions of interest to enhance comprehension. It would have been beneficial to strengthen the evolutionary significance portion of their article. Centromeres are complex genomic regions subject to unique evolutionary forces, including concerted evolution, which can lead to rapid turnover and homogenization of repetitive sequences. The evolutionary history of α-satellite HORs may involve intricate processes that are not fully captured by sequence divergence analyses alone. Without additional comparative genomic analyses or experimental validation, it is challenging to accurately infer the evolutionary age of specific α-satellite HORs. While sequence divergence can provide insights into the evolutionary history of genomic regions, it may not always accurately reflect the age of a particular sequence due to factors such as selective pressures, genetic drift, and genomic rearrangements. Therefore, relying solely on sequence identity plots to infer evolutionary age may oversimplify the evolutionary dynamics of α-satellite HORs. 6)	In the methods, the authors state that the proband had a mosaic karyotype, and provide the same karyotype information that is given on the Coriell repository website for the cell line. Did the authors perform their own validation of the karyotypes of the trio in their cell line aliquots at a passage close to what they used for their experiments? It would be useful for the authors to comment on how the 58% of cells with the translocated chromosome 21 and 22 in the proband might impact their results, if at all. Significance The paper reports significant technical advancements in the study of centromere structure and epigenetics, particularly within the context of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Utilizing long-read sequencing technology PacBio HiFi and UL-ONT, combined with ChIP-Seq, the researchers comprehensively examined centromere size and epigenetic differences, overcoming previous limitations associated with conventional methods. This approach not only facilitated the resolution of complex repetitive regions like centromeres but also enabled the integration of genetic sequencing with epigenetic profiling, providing a holistic understanding of centromere biology. In the broader context of human genetic disorders, the findings of this study offer novel insights into the role of centromere structure and function in the prevalence of Down syndrome. By highlighting the potential contribution of centromere size variability and epigenetic differences to the risk of chromosome nondisjunction, the paper opens new avenues for understanding molecular mechanisms of nondisjunction events, with implications for other aneuploidies beyond Down syndrome. Moreover, further exploration of centromere size variability and epigenetic differences could lead to advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for genetic disorders, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare practices.",2024-04-05T17:40:42,adriannasanroman,Adrianna San Roman,10.1101/2024.02.25.581464,Complete chromosome 21 centromere sequences from a Down syndrome family reveal size asymmetry and differences in kinetochore attachment,"F.

The results however are not satisfactory to this observer’s eye. Taking into account that heat maps can be deceiving ( doi.org/10.1038/s41590-021-..., looking at your Fig. 5C it seems to me that the evidence that the problem is only marginally solved is: -  SMA in lane 15 (Endo): endothelium CD31+ CD14- VIM+ should be SMA-, while you do not have SMA in the stromal clusters, where it should be. - Macrophages (lane 14) are generally CD20-, except for signal bleeding from adjacent C B cells. And, for what is worth a heat map, CD4 signs should be stronger than CD3. - CD8 vanished Your “PD1+ B cells” are probably TCF1+ CD3+ CD4+ T follicular helper cells. As per the smart strategy to use of a plausibility score from a priori knowledge, the only example I do know of usable markers are PAX5 for B cells, CD3 and CD8 for T cells and CD163 for macrophages. Maybe one can add CD14, although it has been described on cDC2 and B1 cells. Everything else is shared by more than one cell type (experience on ~80 markers). CD68 is Macs + pDC, your CD68 clone, KP1, labels also neutrophils, CD20 is on some T cells, CD31 abundantly labels Macs, etc. etc. As per your table S1, CD31 labels T cells (doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02434 ), CD20 and CD68 mutual exclusivity is emptied by your cluster 14 data. Plausibility score should therefore be based on maybe 3-4 hypothetical mutual exclusion. But dimensionality reduction algorithms are much better at that. I believe that the problem is somewhere else in the analytical pipeline: data processing. We developed a pipeline, BRAQUE (Dall’Olio, L.; Bolognesi, M.; Borghesi, S.; Cattoretti, G.; Castellani, G.

Entropy 2023, 25, 354. https://doi.org/10.3390/e25... in which data pre-processing has a major effect in separating clusters, to be further classified. We found (ms in preparation) that endothelial cells can effortlessly be separated from SMA+ fibroblasts. The “doublets” of CD4 and CD8 are minimized (see Table 2). All this without any of the processing you developed with STARLING. Imagine by combining BRAQUE with STARLING! Our data are available in the public domain and can be shared for a focused collaboration. While I do congratulate for the effort and long-standing work in the field, I hope that my observations will further improve the experience in the field.

I've been working on the cultural dimension for some time now and I have reached the conclusion that what is needed is a transition from the growth imperative to the balance imperative. This accords with the panarchy cycle in terms of shifting from the growth stage to the conservation phase. https://passel2.unl.edu/vie.... It accords with the necessary transition from a r-selected strategy to a k-selected strategy. It accords with the maximum power principle in that the goal of evolutionary system design is to optimise the balance between the rate of energy transfer with efficiency of energy transfer which means optimising the balance between force functions, resilience functions, adaptability functions and reproductive functions. In other words, maximising survival potential. https://www.ecologycenter.u... Finally the transition from the growth imperative to the balance imperative accords with the need for the human species to balance with Earth systems and in particular balance human activity with the natural carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and water cycles to ensure healthy and resilient functioning of these cycles. It is of course, natural cycle disequilibrium that typifies human ecological overshoot with the exponential growth of high entropy waste associated with an exponentially growing human abiotic environment which cannot be assimilated naturally by nonhuman biotic and abiotic systems. Therefore I propose that the Post Growth cultural revolution be predicated on the balance imperative with the understanding that nonhuman associated ecological growth needs to be balanced with the human biotic and abiotic enterprise. And that this is a zero sum game between the k-selected strategy and the current r-selected strategy. I think the meme of 'Post Growth' is more relevant than the meme of Degrowth although degrowth can be seen as sub category of Post Growth. I think Post Growth is more relevant because it better describes what is actually occurring within the panarchy cycle and is therefore more relatable in terms of public education and public discourse in terms of explaining actually existing dynamics regarding human societies hitting per capita limits to economic abiotic growth and human societies hitting per capita ecological carrying capacity limits. I would suggest limits to economic growth is indelibly linked to breaching carrying capacity limits but further research is needed to qualify that. This hypothesis suggests that capitalism is responsive to both ecological scarcity and ecological carrying capacity breaches through the price mechanism and should be considered as part of the suite of educational tools to inform the public exactly what is going on beyond the false growth narrative being disseminated by politicians, think tanks, the media and business leaders. Similarly, the capitalist state system does have resilience mechanisms by which economic contraction can be absorbed to some degree. I feel we need to utilise these systems rather than throw the baby out with the bath water. By educating the public at the same time as leaning on the resilience functions embedded within the state capitalist system, we can help coordinate temporary and long lasting solutions to permanent per capita economic contraction by rerouting energy and material throughput as necessary. Therefore rather than a solely bottom up approach, I think we also need to utilise current top down systems to facilitate bottom up participatory approaches in order to try and create a win win mutualist strategy. This would include allowing maladaptive state capitalist functions to perish. Thus rather than using post growth dynamics to reject the state capitalist system which I think will make our shared future even more daunting, I suggest we use the state capitalist system to provide ourselves with buffers to deliberate on the next steps. This would include devising remedial solutions as different parts of the state capitalist system collapses. This means a more gradualist contraction strategy whereby we rationally respond to the changes that are being indicated by the state capitalist system which as I argued above is probably in sync with ecological scarcity and carrying capacity limits via the invisible hand of the market. This isn't to say that part of the cultural revolution from the growth imperative to the balance imperative is to try and make capitalism more sustainable. It is to recognise that capitalism itself emerged as a bottom up strategy from its mercantile roots and that we can now activate the emergence of another bottom up system from the roots of the capitalist system. #BalancenotGrowth #OnePlanetLiving",2024-04-04T17:09:33,stevegwynne,Steve Gwynne,10.1101/2024.04.01.587657,Population growth poses a significant threat to forest ecosystems: a case study from the Hindukush-Himalayas of Pakistan,"Naveed Alam, Zahid Ullah, Bilal Ahmad, Ahmad Ali, Kashmala Syed",2024-04-03

However, present-day Hungarians are overwhelmingly derived from Slavic and German peasants from nearby Hungary. This is not a controversial claim on my part; it's backed up by historical sources and a wide range of genetic analyses. Hungarians still show some minor ancestry from Hungarian Conquerors (early Magyars), but this signal only reliably shows up in large surveys of Y-chromosome samples. The Scythians that you used to model the ancestry of present-day Hungarians are of local, Pannonian origin, and they don't show any eastern nomad ancestry. So they're either acculturated Scythians, or, more likely, wrongly classified as Scythians by archeologists. And since these so-called Scythians lack eastern nomad ancestry, the similarity between them and present-day Hungarians is not a sign of the impact from Avars, Hungarian Conquerors and the like, but rather a lack of significant input from such groups in present-day Hungarians. I've done a rather long blog post about your analysis of Medieval Poles and present-day Hungarians at the link below. Hopefully you'll find it useful. https://eurogenes.blogspot....",2024-03-26T10:05:44,disqus_Og9I1KoklL,Davidski,10.1101/2024.03.15.585102,High-resolution genomic ancestry reveals mobility in early medieval Europe,"Leo Speidel, Marina Silva, Thomas Booth, Ben Raffield, Kyriaki Anastasiadou, Christopher Barrington, Anders Götherström, Peter Heather, Pontus Skoglund",2024-03-19
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.18.585601v1#comment-6421697456,biorxivstage,1,"Congratulations on an interesting theoretical paper which sounds very plausible! Some comments: 1) Your abstract ends:""Here, we show that these empirical patterns all emerge from a single theory incorporating the evolution of cis and trans-acting regulators of gene expression. This theory offers a level of parsimony and generality rarely seen in biology."" But you don't say what ""THIS THEORY"" is! A vague mention of ""cis and trans-acting regulators of gene expression"" does not well encapsulate your hypothesis, if I understand it correctly. Your problem is to explain chromosome-wide effects, the effect of overall ancestry. You don't mention a key part of your theory, which is DOSAGE COMPENSATION!!! I think you should do this in the abstract. 2) You don't cite our papers, and why should you have done so? -- they came out very recently, probably after you'd done most of this work. However, I think our recent genomic mapping papers on Haldane's Rule in female heterogametic butterflies are highly relevant and provide circumstantial evidence for the chromosome-wide, polygenic effects required in your dosage-compensation hypothesis, especially on the Z chromosome. The two relevant papers are: Rosser, N., Edelman, N.B., Queste, L.M., Nelson, M., Seixas, F., Dasmahapatra, K.K., & Mallet, J. 2022. Complex basis of hybrid female sterility and Haldane's rule in Heliconius butterflies: Z-linkage and epistasis. Molecular Ecology 31:959-977. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec... Xiong, T., Tarikere, S., Rosser, N., Li, X., Yago, M., & Mallet, J. 2023. A polygenic explanation for Haldane’s rule in butterflies. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 120:e2300959120. https://doi.org/10.1073/pna... The latter paper especially, which re-analyzes inferences made about the weird epistatic sterility effects inferred via QTL analysis  in the former paper. A quantitative  proportion of ancestry effect is a better fit, according to Xiong et al., than the single locus + (left and right end of the chromosome pairwise epistasis) proposed by Rosser et al. Of course, it was well known since Dobzhansky 1936 that hybrid sterility in Drosophila was multi-locus. See: Dobzhansky, T. 1936. Studies on hybrid sterility. II. Localization of sterility factors in Drosophila pseudoobscura hybrids. Genetics 21:113-135. https://doi.org/10.1093/gen... I think our papers suggest, or at least comport with the idea that in two distantly related pairs of butterfly species, female hybrid sterility is also mediated by multilocus effects, at least along the Z chromosome. The fraction of ancestry matters. As we wrote ""The molecular nature of polygenicity is unresolved. In our case, it is tempting to consider epigenetic mechanisms between autosomes and the Z chromosome. For instance, genetic variance of pupal weight in backcross males is much smaller than that in females (SI Appendix, Table S2). This is consistent, for instance, with dosage compensation in Lepidoptera in which both Z chromosomes in males are partially suppressed (37), which will dampen the effects of introgressed factors."" Anyway, congratulations on a very stimulating idea that certainly seems plausible!",2024-03-26T03:38:19,disqus_SYPSTkdo10,James Mallet,10.1101/2024.03.18.585601,A single theory for the evolution of sex chromosomes and the two rules of speciation,"Thomas Lenormand, Denis Roze",2024-03-20

The first paper, to my knowledge, dealing with chemical denaturation is from 1978 (Tramu, G., et al. J Histochem Cytochem 26, 322–324 (1978). 10.1177/26.4.207771), followed in 1986 by  Kolodziejczyk, E. & Baertschi, A. J.  J Histochem Cytochem 34, 1725–1729 (1986). 10.1177/34.12.3023476 and then by your ref n. 5 (Pirici) in 2009. We published extensively on multiplex staining with the approach you suggested, in 2014 (Gendusa, R., et al. J. Histochem.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.27.568675v1#comment-6417484638,biorxivstage,1,"Upon reading the recent preprint titled “Dietary reconstructions of Magdalenian canids from SW-Germany do not indicate that the area was a centre of early European wolf domestication” by Bons et al. on BioRxiv, it has come to our attention that certain aspects require clarification to ensure accurate information is conveyed. First and foremost, it is essential to mention that the referenced paper has undergone a rigorous peer-review process and did not meet the acceptance criteria, resulting in its rejection. Maintaining transparency and accuracy in discussions related to the scholarly review process is imperative. In responding to the preprint, our intention is to focus on rectifying any potential misinterpretations within the content of our work. While constructive criticism and scientific discourse are vital components of academic discussion, our emphasis remains on addressing the scientific aspects rather than engaging in personal disputes. Below we address the seven main scientific criticisms of our study. 1. Why were the canids from Gnirshöhle called dogs? In our paper, we did not definitely classify the remains as dogs or wolves on purpose. We hypothesize that all Gnirshöhle canids had restricted diet and where at the beginning of the domestication process of wolves leading to dogs, which is why we have chosen the title as ""A refined proposal for the origin of dogs"". All scientific evidence points out that wolves are the wild ancestors of dogs, so addressing the origin of dogs requires that we investigate some ancient wolves. During the early steps of wolf domestication, it is expected that the first changes will take place in the behavior of some individuals within a larger wolf population and therefore, changes in the isotopic composition of canid bones will occur among individuals with similar genetic background. This is exactly what is documented in our article, as the canids were genetically like wolves at the mitochondrial level, while their diet was very specific and not comparable to the diet of other wolves from the Magdalenian. To us and the reviewers of our study, this was convincing evidence of a restrictive diet, most likely influenced by prehistoric humans, which can be interpreted as pet-keeping. This would be the first step of wolf domestication - hence the title of the article, consistent with recent scientific literature. 2. Why did we include foxes and did two large canid clusters? As Bons et al. correctly pointed out, the number of clusters can be reduced or increased. To test if the chosen number of clusters leads to a bias in the distinction between the two clusters of large canids, we made another analysis by first excluding the foxes and reducing the number of clusters to two. The result is that the large canids are divided in the same way, as in our three clusters, into two groups of large canids. Only the one wolf from Schussenquelle (SCH-11), formerly in the fox niche, joins the canids from Gnirshöhle, because of its low δ15N value. Nevertheless, the same clear difference can be seen between the large canids with high δ15N values (δ15N = 7.9 ± 0.9 ‰) and the large canids with low δ15N values (δ15N = 5.8 ± 0.3 ‰, which we have called diet-restricted canids). To separate the foxes and use them as a ‘trophic outgroup’, we decided to construct three clusters instead of two in our original article. 3. Why is comparing the isotopic variation of modern wolf hair with the isotopic variation in ancient wolf collagen invalid and misleading? Bons et al. compared our measured isotopic values in bone collagen with those of modern wolf hair from the USA. This argument is intended to show that our niche reconstruction is not valid because the intraspecific variability of the isotopes is too large to allow it. However, hair records a snapshot of individual life and therefore are subject to short-term and seasonal dietary fluctuations, leading to potentially high isotopic variability. In contrast, bone collagen records average isotope values over several years of the animal's life. Therefore, the ranges of isotopic variations of bone collagen are not comparable to those from hair. A high variability in hair isotope data comes from seasonal, regional, and other short-term and local variations, while in contrast, high variability in bone collagen can only come from different dietary preferences over a long period of time spanning over a year. Thus, isotopic variations in bone collagen were adequate to show different feeding strategies and are related to trophic behavior and niches. 4. Did the inclusion of one data point possibly from the Late Pleistocene to Holocene transition influence the interpretation? We used only isotopic data from the Magdalenian (c. 16 to 14 k yrs calBP) to calculate diet and niches, therefore prior to this environmental transition. Only one single wolf from Hohle Fels (c. 13.2 kyrs calBP) could fall into the Late Pleistocene to Holocene transition, which dated from c. 12.4 - 10.8 kyrs BP. However, this potential chronological outlier was not the subject of discussion. All the other 13 canid individuals, as well as the food resources, come from secured archaeological layers of the Magdalenian or have even been directly dated (all dates were published in our article). 5. Why did we use the TEF of foxes instead of wolves? Bons et al. questioned our decision to use the TEF values of foxes from Krajcarz et al. (2018) and not using the published wolf’s TEF values. The values calculated by Krajcarz et al. (2018) correspond to a “natural” case study, where canids have to actively forage, catch, and consume their own food, in contrast to the published wolf TEF values, calculated more indirectly. They are thus the most recently published and the closest to the reality of canid’s metabolism. The metabolism of foxes and wolves is very similar because they belong to the same taxonomic family and could feed on the same kind of prey. 6. Was essential information about our dietary reconstructions not provided, and why are the results apparently not the same as in Bons et al.? We have included all the necessary raw data in our article to allow scientists to replicate our calculations. The most important control factors for good and usable models are the Geweke and Gelman-Rubin tests. Both tests independently indicate the convergence of the model and are essential information that must be given for the models used. The chain length of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) must also be reported, as well as the number of chains and the burn-in. The reason that Bons et al. got different results from the model than we did may be that their model did not run convergently, which cannot be verified due to the lack of Geweke and Gelman-Rubin test results. 7. Did the individual age of GNI-999 as a subadult change the interpretation? According to Bons et al.’s interpretation of the CT scans of one individual, GNI-999, this is a subadult individual, which would have significantly changed our interpretation if we had included it. This is incorrect. As Bons et al. also acknowledge, this was not a young puppy, which means that the bone collagen examined was not influenced by consumption of mother’s milk. In fact, the isotopic values of subadult canids should be considered equivalent to those of an adult animal because they do not have a 15N-enriched milk signal after weaning and thus, the δ15N values of their bone collagen are not elevated. According to Geiger et al. (2016), the CT scan of GN-999 shows an age of at least four months, whereas wolves are weaned after three months (Packard 2019). Therefore, this statement does not affect our interpretation of its isotopic values. Moreover, it has also no consequences on the interpretation of the 13 other specimens of large canids considered in the paleogenetic and isotopic investigation presented in our article.
