Many neurons in synergistic muscles are correlated with a unique subset of neurons. I strongly suggest you check with pearson correlation of the smoothed motor unit discharge rates. Also, force variability is only partly predicted by a single common input. Please stop assuming overly simplistic and reductionist conclusions.You also show that only 70% of the variance (which, in fact, should be 50 to 60% of the first component) is explained. In all other disciplines, it is usually concluded that it is only one component when it explains more than 90% of the variance! BOOK KNOWLEDGE: In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), when it's concluded that there is only one component, the first principal component should ideally explain a significant portion of the variance—typically more than 90%. However, the exact threshold can depend on the specific context or data, but generally, when a single component explains more than 90% of the variance, it's reasonable to conclude that this component captures the majority of the relevant information in the data. If the first component explains less than 90%, it might suggest that multiple components are needed to adequately represent the variance in the data, and assuming only one component could oversimplify the analysis. In your case, when discussing 70% variance, it might imply that the first component doesn't fully capture the structure of the data, and it could suggest that more components are necessary to explain a larger proportion of the variance.",2025-02-10T15:33:35,,Anonymous,10.1101/2025.02.04.635938,A single low-dimensional neural component of motor unit activity explains force generation across repetitive isometric tasks,"Hélio V.

The study by Chirumbolo et al. presents a compelling and innovative perspective on adaptive chaos and its role in modulating oxygen-ozone therapy for spine disorders. By integrating mathematical modeling, bioinformatics, and clinical insights, the authors provide a rigorous framework to understand how mild chaotic perturbations can enhance systemic complexity and biological resilience. A particular strength of this work lies in its multidimensional approach, incorporating Shannon entropy, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions to quantify the therapeutic impact of oxygen-ozone therapy. Therefire, in my opinion, the authors successfully demonstrate that low-dose ozone (20–40 µg/ml O3) fosters adaptive chaos, leading to reduced inflammation, enhanced repair, and improved systemic stability. In contrast, higher doses (>60 µg/ml O3) appear to push the system into pathological chaos, emphasizing the importance of precision dosing in regenerative medicine. Really interesting outcomes! The translational significance of this study cannot be overstated. It not only advances our understanding of chaos-driven medical interventions but also sets a precedent for personalized medicine strategies that leverage nonlinear dynamics to optimize therapeutic outcomes. Future research could expand on these findings by incorporating real-world clinical datasets and patient-specific modeling, further solidifying the role of adaptive chaos in medical practice. I trust this study is a landmark contribution to the fields of biophysics, complexity science, and regenerative medicine, offering novel insights into the interplay between biological chaos and therapeutic control.

We incorporated some of your suggestions to add more context to discoveries made by your group and others regarding Cav1 in Ewing Sarcoma- appreciate the suggestions! In our studies, the subset of CD99 High cells we characterized do indeed have caveolae- so in contrast to previous studies- we believe the signaling in these cells do depend on caveolae per se and not just Caveolin-1 expression. Thanks also for the comment on other signaling pathways- MAPK levels were low in our hands for all these cells (CD99 High or Low)  but maybe worth revisiting.

First, the stimuli used by the authors here is static gratings vs drifting gratings. This alone should have made the discussion more nuanced than our paradigm is superior. While this study showed ""more samples"" per condition, the other study (mine) showed drifting gratings for 1.5s at 3Hz and so multiple samples per trial are shown (since phases are repeated in one showing). Drifting gratings have a motion component that leads to neuronal integration that could better pick up subtle differences in orientation selectivity. As for preferred spatial frequency, we both found that this was not perturbed. Yet, it should be noted that this ""superior"" study found the spatial frequency preferences were half those found in the inferior study (0.06 vs 0.12 cpd). In fact, their more coarse preferred spatial frequency values of adult V1 is more in line with our measurements in juvenile mice. Moreover, the way they carried out behavior (one screen grey, one with the same orientation but at varying spatial frequency) can only detect deficits in spatial acuity, which is is just one aspect determining visual acuity and is one that we both agree was not altered anyhow. Lastly, this ""superior"" study fails to show that they can measure immature responses as they never measured responses in juveniles. Given that their spatial frequency preferences match our juvenile values, the validity of their bold title is brought into question. The inferior study also had inhibitory neuron responses gathered in parallel, thus showing that a range of visual tuning properties can be measured by the inferior study authors. But sure, go ahead and discuss science as black and white rather than have a more nuanced discussion.",2025-01-28T19:01:35,,Dario,10.1101/2023.10.17.562708,Microglia are dispensable for experience-dependent refinement of visual circuitry,"Thomas C.

Supplementary Figure 1: The authors describe the injection of 300 ng peptides, but Supplementary Figure 1 shows variations in TIC signal intensities for the compared techniques. These differences may stem from the two different peptide quantification assays employed and described in the study. From a mass spectrometry perspective, such discrepancies make it challenging to technically compare different enrichment techniques due to the influence of signal intensity variations on the S/N ratio, peak-picking algorithms, peptide quantities, and sequence coverage. We recommend to repeat the study and use our recommendations for peptide quantification compatible to ENRICHplus. In addition, it is important to acknowledge that the ENRICHplus pre-release version was employed for the comparison, which differs from the commercial version scheduled for release on February 22, 2025.

Would it possible to do a more chronic study with these explants with lower concentrations of buprenorphine? I'm sure this depends primarily on how long the explants can be functionally maintained. Also, are you considering looking at whether the major metabolites of buprenorphine (norbuprenorphine, glucuronides) also can cause placental sterile inflammation? As you may know, the Concheiro paper showed higher median concentrations of these metabolites than the parent drug in placenta.",2025-01-16T20:56:10,,Lisa Brents,10.1101/2024.11.22.624850,Buprenorphine Induces Human Fetal Membrane Sterile Inflammation,"Tatyana Lynn, Megan E Kelleher, Hanah M Georges, Elle M McCauley, Ryan W Logan, Kimberly A Yonkers, Vikki M Abrahams",2024-11-22

Our analysis suggests that the observed Sendai virus RNA results are due to Sendai virus persistence or contamination in specific cell lines, rather than errors during RNA-seq library preparation. Evidence of Historical Contamination: Sendai virus sequences were identified in control human ESCs from Buckberry et al.’s study, where no intentional infection was performed. This pattern of contamination recurs in another independent study from the Polo lab (Liu et al., Nature Methods 2017), indicating a long-standing issue with cell line handling rather than repetitive incidental contamination during library preparations (Figure 1b). Selective Detection of Sendai Virus RNA: We observed a gradient in Sendai virus expression across different time-course samples and cell culture conditions (Figure 1b). Only uninfected fibroblasts and TNT iPSCs were completely Sendai-free. This gradient, along with the presence of Sendai-free samples, supports the notion that Sendai virus detection is associated with specific cell lines, not random library preparation errors. Noncompliance with Manufacturer’s Protocols: The CytoTune™ 2.0 Reprogramming Kit Manual explicitly instructs picking iPSC colonies and following steps for Sendai virus removal—steps that were not adhered to by Buckberry et al. Disregarding these crucial instructions has compromised the studied iPSCs, raising concerns about the reliability and reproducibility of the obtained results. Additionally, the response states: ""The potential continued expression of the Sendai virus in Naive-hiPS cells has already been reported by us and others in the field [3–5]."" However, neither the Nature nor the Nature Methods papers discuss Sendai expression in naive samples, nor do they cite the study by Yamanaka's lab that addresses this issue.",2025-01-16T18:25:23,disqus_IJij91XW1k,Sergiy Velychko,10.1101/2024.03.07.583804,Sendai virus persistence questions the transient naive reprogramming method for iPSC generation,"Alejandro De Los Angeles, Clemens B.

It seems like DoRothEA ( https://saezlab.github.io/dorothea/) is a GRN inference tool. We used SCENIC in our method. One can use DoRothEA or other tools to get the network and run the algorithm on that. DoRothEA gives negative edge weights too, so it might be interesting.
