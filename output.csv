It is nice to see when the original intent (public reviews) of BiorXiv is met. We acquired our FRAP data with an acquisition interval of 1 second with a frame size 512 x 512 squared pixels. This was done after several rigorous standardization sessions to comparatively measure all 19 different protein LLPS systems under identical FRAP instrumental parameters. During our standardization runs, we had tried with more frequent acquisition intervals (frame rates) and also in continuous mode—both leading to substantial passive bleaching for our LLPS systems—rendering our measurements very difficult to analyze. You are right that for a satisfactory single-exponential fit, more data-points between 0 and 100% recovery (especially near the 50% recovery region) are required. We would like to emphasize that indeed, we do have several points between 0 and 100% recovery (and also in the region around 50% recovery) for all of our samples. Important to note that in our figures (Figure 2b and 3b), we have plotted the FRAP recovery for 19 protein LLPS systems in a single panel. We did not show all the data points in our figure panel simply for the sake of visual clarity. In the figure panels of our manuscript, we have shown data-points for every 4 seconds while the raw data were acquired every 1 second. The t1/2 were calculated from fitting the raw data with a single-exponential model and therefore takes into account all the data points near the 50% recovery region (taken with 1 second interval). Only for α-Syn LLPS, we have only one data point around 80% recovery after which the system recovers fully. By fitting this data with a standard single-exponential model, we have obtained a t1/2, which is very close to the reported value of t1/2 for α-Syn LLPS that we have previously published; where we do have several data-points near the 50% recovery zone. However, after your comments, we will surely perform FRAP of α-Syn droplets with a more frequent acquisition interval. We would like to thank you for pointing this out. Please also note that we have not calculated the t1/2 values in Figure 5g. The data only emphasizes on the high recovery of fluorescence indicating the liquid-like nature of the droplets formed by homo-polypeptides.",2022-01-29T07:32:46,disqus_8I6X6MC9uJ,Komal Patel,10.1101/2021.12.31.474648,Liquid condensate is a common state of proteins and polypeptides at the regime of high intermolecular interactions,"Manisha Poudyal, Komal Patel, Ajay Singh Sawner, Laxmikant Gadhe, Pradeep Kadu, Debalina Datta, Semanti Mukherjee, Soumik Ray, Ambuja Navalkar, Siddhartha Maiti, Debdeep Chatterjee, Riya Bera, Nitisha Gahlot, Ranjith Padinhateeri, Samir K.

As part of our review of pre-prints, we compile comments from our discussion that we think may better your publication. Overall, our group found the manuscript to be a very interesting read with detailed information on the structure/function of SteD emerging. We can tell that considerable thought that went into each experiment as well as figure production. Your lab has shown an exceptional amount of rigor in your experimental designs that made it difficult to refute your findings. This study was very well done, and we all enjoyed discussing it. Below we point out some comments and aspects that we feel could improve on the manuscript. 1)	We felt that the text was a little difficult to follow. Though it is probable that this will be alleviated once the paper has been properly formatted, as the figures help a great deal in understanding the text. 2)	We very much appreciated the short anecdotes in the manuscript explaining the specific actions of the chemicals used for your experiments. None in our journal club work this closely with transport systems and it made understanding your work much easier. 3)	We were curious about your justification for using a melanoma cell line in your studies rather than an APC line like BMDMs? We’ve noticed that it has been used for other Salmonella studies, but we think it necessary that you justify in the text why you use this cell line. 4)	The order of your figures is a little confusing, specifically figures 1-3. We think it would really help if you were to either combine Figures 1 and 3 in some manner or reorder them so that Figure 3 comes just after Figure 1, rather than being interrupted by Figure 2. This would streamline the reading and comprehension of your data greatly. 5)	On the topic of Figure 3, we were curious as to why you found the specificities you did and yet continued to use the region 13 mutation rather than the S68A G69A mutations in your experiments for Figure 4. Especially given the problems you had with region 13 mutation expression and release from Salmonella. 6)	Our group wanted to extend our compliments to your inclusion of the protein diagrams you had throughout your paper. The visualization made it easy to understand the mutations made and really helped with the overall comprehension of the paper and the experiments you were completing. On this note, however, we don’t think it necessary to highlight the F and Y residues in Figure 7. They are discussed in the text but are not tested in the figure. That depiction would be better included in a supplemental figure showing the experimental results from those mutations. 7)	Lastly, we believe Figure 5C should be moved to supplementary since it only confirms that your siRNA worked as intended.

Overall, we enjoyed this manuscript discussing the multi-kingdom interactions of bacteria, fungi and amoebae, and their implications for the evolution of pathogenicity and endosymbiosis in natural environments. We thought the impact of the bacterial endosymbiosis on the fungal interactions with other eukaryotes was very cool, the experiments were well controlled, and the phenomenon was well documented. Major comments and suggestions: The claims made in the title are considerably broader than what was shown in the data, specifically the idea that the amoebae are ""drivers"" of both endosymbiosis and pathogenicity. While the impacts of the endosymbiosis on Dicty are very nicely shown, an important part that is missing is: what are the impacts of Dicty on the fungi/bacteria, either alone or during symbiosis? How do amoebae alter their endosymbiosis or pathogenicity? There is no demonstrated selection by the amoebae on either of these traits, both of which are important pieces to make this ""driver"" claim. Relatedly, given that the endosymbiosis generally increases fungal spore resistance to multiple environmental stressors (Fig. 6C), it could easily be that abiotic stressors are 'driving' some of these phenotypes in natural microbial populations. Possible ways to improve this gap include: - mixing different ratios of symbiotic and aposymbiotic fungi and placing these under an amoeba predation regime. Do the symbiotic fungi end up with a larger population size? In the mixed cultures, are aposymbiotic fungi preferentially eaten? - An experimental evolution study in which aposymbiotic fungi are incubated with extracellular symbionts +/- amoeba predation. Does amoeba predation select for re-initiation of the symbiosis? - Adding selective pressures from a couple of different amoeba species in this experiment, as it might vary considerably across amoebae - Rephrasing the title to remove the evolutionary 'driver' framing. Minor comments: - The figure labeling and figure legends could be clarified in Figures 3, 4, and 8, - In Fig. 4F, why was such a small percentage of the R. pickettii conditioned medium added? You showed earlier in this figure that it takes a relatively large % of conditioned medium to see an effect. - In Fig. 6E-H, given that the cell wall composition looks different by TEM in D, we recommend performing these staining experiments in parallel in symbiotic and aposymbiotic strains to get a hint of how the cell wall has changed. - Fig 8 B seems to show similar data (but with less information) than Fig 8A. Can you include 8A only, with an 8A-like graph for the swollen spores as well (currently 8C)?",2022-01-27T16:41:35,teralevin,Tera Levin,10.1101/584607,Environmental interactions with amoebae as drivers of bacterial-fungal endosymbiosis and pathogenicity,"Herbert Itabangi, Poppy C.

I am not going to respond to everything right now, but I want you to know that this feedback has been seen and will be included when we make our next round of revisions. We are currently working on another iteration of this analysis that tries to answer a specific clinical question. We have metagenomes from a large cohort of pregnant people that have high exposure to three antibiotics of different drug classes.  For one of the conditions in our cohort is BV or bacterial Vaginosis - it is recurring so antibiotics often do not completely resolve the condition. We are interested in understanding AMR plays a role in this recurrance, but since we are interested in AMR to only a few drugs, we need to carefully select the tool for detecting the AMR genes in this cohort. We are going to basically repeat the methods (integrating your point in #2) to try to select the tool that can ""best"" detect the resistance for these three drugs in this cohort. I hope that makes it clearer! Again, thank you for taking the time to provide this feedback. These are all good points for improving the science.

You should check that. This is probably a signal picked up by tour neural network. Another reason could be your fixation and rehydration protocol that increases the ambient noise. - Yes, it is unexpected high. It is unlikely to be sequencing artefacts, as the spacer sequences are very different from each other in the libraries -- we tried to avoid mis-targeting effects of CRISPRi when designing these libraries. We hypothesize that the enrichment procedure of guide sequences exposes the ambient sgRNAs, this may explain why there are fewer ambient mRNAs comparing to sgRNAs. We also observed the presence of strong ambient signals in other datasets from other labs, please see supplementary Fig. 2. Together, we think this may be a systematic issue of single cell omics rather than specific experimental problem (e.g. impropriate infection). This is what scAR aim to solve. I like your idea of fixation and rehydration protocol. The preparation of single cell suspension definitely should have an impact on ambient noise. We briefly discuss this in the last paragraph in discussion section. - with a multiplicity of infection of 0.3, you do expect ~25% of the cells to have >2 guides. If you find less there is a problem. However your expression vs guide assignment argument is convincing for the accuracy of scAR so it might be worth checking the expression of the candidate second guide targets. - There should be a small fraction of multi-infection. The output of scAR is a matrix of Bayesian factors, one can set a global threshold on it to assign the guides, which should be able to distinguish single infection and multi-infection. As mentioned in the manuscript, the purpose here is to demonstrate the accuracy of scAR, so we do not use any arbitrary thresholds on either naive assignment and scAR. For a specific study, we would recommend to set a reasonable threshold on the output of scAR, although we will provide a default threshold for simplicity. We will demonstrate these in a tutorial. Many thanks again for your interest and comments. I wish you a great weekend.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.20.465113v1#comment-5702278403,biorxivstage,2,"Hello! This is the Debelouchina Lab at University of California, San Diego. We have begun doing preprint manuscript reviews during our “journal clubs” as a way to enhance our engagement with current literature and to hopefully assist with the manuscript if possible! Our lab also studies the behaviors of biomolecular liquid-solid transitions – with a focus on protein structure. We selected this manuscript out of curiosity for the spatial origins of solidification in liquid-liquid phase separated systems. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is central to the spatiotemporal organization of biomolecules in the cell. Many of the proteins that are thought to mediate LLPS have also been found in pathological aggregates and fibrils that are associated with neurodegenerative disease. It has been demonstrated that liquid-like phase separated bodies can adopt gel-like or solid morphologies over time, which suggests that LLPS droplets may serve as nucleation points for pathological aggregates. This manuscript interrogates this process by characterizing the spatial characteristics of the liquid-to-solid transition within individual alpha-synuclein condensates using a set of fluorescence and infrared microscopy techniques. The authors found that droplets solidify form a central focal point that can be imaged through associated changes in fluorescence lifetime (via fluorescence lifetime imaging, FLIM) and protein secondary structure (via Fourier transform infra-red microscopy, FTIRM). To emphasize this significance in the text, we think it may be helpful if the authors added more background and discussion of previous literature on the spatial origin of solidification. These findings are exciting as they add new insight into biomolecular liquid-to-solid transitions, and relevant due to the potential role for liquid-to-solid transitions in neurodegenerative disease. We find that the combination of fluorescence microscopy techniques used here presents a strong model for studying spatiotemporal material properties of biomolecular condensates, which are challenging to characterize from a structural perspective due to their inherent heterogeneity and sensitivity to environmental factors. The power of these techniques is shown in their ability to complement the FLIM data into protein mobility (FRAP), structure (FTIRM), and interaction (FRET) components, providing a comprehensive look into the liquid-to-solid transition. We appreciated the use of small fluorophores rather than fluorescent proteins, as well as the confirmation by fluorophore-free techniques (TEM & cryo-SEM). Overall, we find that the data and the resulting model for the spatiotemporal dynamics of the liquid-solid transition are compelling. One area we are curious about is the sample handling, keeping a sample hydrated for 20 days is difficult. Would you be able to add a few words about the robustness of this moisture chamber in the main text? These aspects of the experimental design might not be obvious to a reader unfamiliar with the practical considerations of experiments like this, so more discussion would be helpful to anyone trying to reproduce the experiments. In a similar vein, a paragraph about the practical aspects of FLIM in the context of LLPS would be helpful. We also wondered about the necessity of the solidification timeline, how would the microscopy procedures described here work for a system that progresses to solid much faster than 20 days? What are the time limitations of these techniques? Would a faster system be expected to have the same center-growth effect as seen here? We were surprised that droplets appear to solidify from the exact center of the droplet in every case. If the model for solidification is that it begins from a (random) nucleation point, then why would droplet solidification always begin exactly in the center, as opposed to the inner or outer center regions that are mapped in Figure 1. We were left wanting more information about this, especially since FLIM is capable of resolving changes on these scales. It would be interesting to see if there are any cases where solidification does not begin from the exact center of the droplet. Some minor comments: -While the figures are clear and well-organized, a more colorblind-friendly palette could be used. -Infrared is occasionally hyphenated throughout the text. -The abstract figure may be clarified if the FLIM images were all of a single droplet, matching the cartoon. -The schematics describing the planes on the droplet are beautifully done and very helpful to understanding the figures. -Figure 1: formatting error with (e) placement. -Figure 2: (c) As we are unfamiliar with FTIRM, we thought it may be useful to have the corresponding secondary structure to each wavenumber (like the supplementary table 1 information) in the figure. Similarly, while supplementary figure 7 has a monomer and fibril control, we would have enjoyed that in the main figure. -Figure 4: (c) We wonder how consistent these recoveries are for several different droplets at the same time point. -For the TEM data (Fig 5), the results are a little bit different from other attempts to perform TEM on LLPS systems (for example, here: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.... A discussion of precedent would be appreciated in the main text. -Supplementary Fig. 11: We thought these EM images were fascinating and are curious if such images exist elsewhere for biomolecular condensates. ---------------------------------------------- We appreciated the chance to read and review this manuscript, The Debelouchina Lab",2022-01-21T22:03:41,,Debelouchina Lab,10.1101/2021.10.20.465113,Spatiotemporal solidification of α-synuclein inside the liquid droplets,"Soumik Ray, Debdeep Chatterjee, Semanti Mukherjee, Komal Patel, Jaladhar Mahato, Sangram Kadam, Rakesh Krishnan, Ajay Singh Sawner, Manisha Poudyal, G Krishnamoorthy, Arindam Chowdhury, Ranjith Padinhateeri, Samir K.

Indeed, we had to face some hard decisions while discussing the protocol. I think that 10cm is not enough for some soils. However, we have to stick to a single and unambiguous standard. The 10cm is chosen because of compatibility: this depth is used to assess microbial communities and soil functions/parameters by the core Soil BON network AND this depth is used to assess micro- and msofauna by us. This way, the data will be better and quantitatively connected. Besides, we have to reduce efforts per site to make the global assessment feasible. Having 20 or 30 cm for macrofauna sorting is considerably more work (tricky for many teams and for transportation of soil if necessary), but less compatibility and not always much additional information.

Unlike the intensively studied transfer of small regulatory RNA and fragmented RNA by extracellular vesicles, relatively little is known about full-length mRNA transfer between adjacent cells via direct cell-to-cell tunneling nanotubes (TNTs).  Dasgupta et al provide a comprehensive set of the high depth bulk RNA-sequencing experiments and downstream bioinformatics analysis to determine overall levels of the most abundantly transferred RNA. They show that RNA transfer to the acceptor mouse cells is non-selective and the amount of transferred RNA strongly correlates with the endogenous level of gene expression in the donor human cells. They validate these results using a variety of orthogonal approaches (e.g. qRT-PCR, smFISH together with advanced imaging techniques, spatially separated cell culture) that overall support: 1) The relatively low level of endogenous mRNAs and lncRNAs transfer via TNTs. 2) TNTs as the predominant route for transcriptome-wide mRNA transfer. In addition, both cis-RNA motif-enrichment analysis and synthetic RNA reporter assays in cell culture back-up the authors’ conclusions on non-selective RNA transfer via TNTs. Lastly, the authors observed stark changes in the acceptor mouse cell transcriptome in response to co-culture with the donor human cancer cells, including the upregulation of cancer-associated genes as result of oncogenic-like transformation.  This is a carefully performed study based on a simple and quantitative method. Overall the conclusions are well justified and supported, limitations of the study are clearly stated. The only minor comments and suggestions that I have are: 1.  The authors performed polyA(+) RNA-sequencing. How abundant could be the 3’ end partially decayed mRNA transferred to the acceptor cells? 2. The direct correlation between RNA and protein levels in MCF7 is shown previously in (Edfors et al 2016). Is it known that the TNT-transferred MCF7 mRNAs undergo translation in the acceptor mouse cells? 3. TNTs are also shown to transfer proteins. Is there any overlap between the TNT-transferred mRNA and proteins? The points 2-3 are very challenging to address but could be discussed. 4. Fig 3C. Is mRNA half-life in K562 consistent with the mRNA half-life rates in MCF7? 5. I find the ability of the transferred RNA to down-regulate cell immunity-related genes interesting. Could this be an indirect effect? The authors used unique mapped reads in downstream bioinformatics analysis. Is there any estimation of the multi-mapped reads in the TNT-transferred RNA fraction?",2022-01-17T19:43:52,innabiryukova,innabiryukova,10.1101/2021.11.28.470233,Global analysis of human-to-mouse intercellular RNA transfer in cell culture,"Sandipan Dasgupta, Daniella Y.

But I am more doubtful about the methodology. I have 3 main comments. First, it would be useful to provide the AMR genes detected in the assembled genomes of the selected isolates. If only the reads are available, assemble them with SPADES. Do the search with the differents tools and combine detections which match at the same locus. This will helps the reader to know what exactly is expected from the artificial mock metagenome. For instance, I can't believe that fARGene finds 713 distinct genes after condensation, and even the 33 genes for RGI is suspicious. Comparing detections from the mock with the expected number from assembled genomes will provide some new useful metrics. This will help to provide more details on what is detected/not detected (which genes) and why. Related to the reference database/models ? To the defaults matching parameters ? Other ? Second, the way the mock community is constructed is inadequate. Metagenomic data reflect complex microbial communities (of hundreds of taxa) for which a small minority are AMR pathogens. Putting 9 highly multi-resistant pathogens together at equal proportion is not consistent with real metagenomes. In this regard, reducing the coverage from 100x to 50x and 5x doesn't help because AMR genes represent the exact same relative abundance in terms of reads in the 3 datasets. I would suggest to get a bunch of other isolate's sequences, from sensitive bacteria and include them in excess to simulate the whole bacterial community. The proportion of pathogens could then be modulated (e.g. 1/50, 1/100, 1/1000) to simulate the various conditions (healthy / infected patients). Last and more scientifically speaking, I don't really get for which kind of purpose the AMR gene detection will be used, and how the connection with phenotypic resistance will be treated (inference ?). The manuscript refers several times to clinical diagnosis use of metagenomic data, but I don't understand how. For instance, several E. coli strains concurrently exist in the gut, so detecting a bla-TEM gene in the metagenome will not help to infer which E. coli is resistant. And it may actually not be a E. coli at all since most AMR genes can be found in different species. I hope these few comments will help to improve this work, I don't have time to proceed to a full review.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.442980v3#comment-5695093873,biorxivstage,1,"Dear Cheng Zhao et al., Thank you for this first attempt at unbiasedly comparing the transcriptomic state of the cells of early human embryo models. Merging datasets to create reference maps, and applying multiple methods to identify cell fates is really important and it is crucial to ensure an appropriate understanding of the predictivity of the model. Your analysis matches some of the original analyses by the articles you study, despite using a different reference map. We were happy that you come to the same conclusion as us that about 3% of our cells are not matching EPI, trophoblast, or extraembryonic endoderm lineages, which is encouraging (note that we did not use the dataset from Zheng et al. in our merged reference map). Please find below a couple of remarks that we hope will help you with the revision process. Our first main concern is that you are focusing the interpretation of your analysis on one study (Liu et al. 2021). Instead, we think that it would be better to propose tools and data that everyone can work with and use to interpret data and form conclusions (your website is a good start in that direction). The scientific process is fallible by nature and we think it is important to openly give the results without dismissing the original proposals, in order to gradually improve our understanding of the cell states produced within these models. We understand the specificities of the publication format but we think that this first concern can be easily addressed by adapting the title and the text. The second main concern is that you are not taking into account the embryonic stages. A primary goal of an embryo model is to form cells reflecting a specific stage, in that case, the human blastocyst stage (days 5 to 7). After, from day 8, the embryo starts implanting into the uterus and forms the stages following the blastocyst one. During these transitions, cell states change rapidly to fulfil a sequence of different functions (e.g., the TE becomes polar TE to mediate the attachment to the endometrium). As such, ensuring the predictive power of the model requires that the model forms blastocyst-like cells. The lack of assessment of the stages of the Trophoblast-like cells (TLCs), Epiblast-like cells (ELC), and Hypoblast-like cells (HLC, a.k.a. PrE) lead to ambiguous interpretations. These stages might be evaluated by increasing the number of Seurat clusters and affiliating a stage to each cluster based on the percentage of staged embryo cells within each cluster. This affiliation can be controlled by looking at the expression of stage-specific markers: the zones of the blastocyst-stage are well defined on your map by some markers of the EPI (e.g., SUSD2, KLF17 [PMID: 29361568]) or of the trophoblasts (e.g., CDX2). Also, the annotation of the TE in Figure 1A is misleading. The term TE is generally used to describe the trophoblastic tissue that forms the wall of the blastocyst (E5-7). After implantation, the TE generates other trophoblast cell types including syncytiotrophoblasts, or cytotrophoblasts, this later state being captured by the hTSCs derived by Okae et al., which were also included in your UMAPs. In this figure 1A, you used the term TE for trophoblasts harvested from blastocysts cultured in vitro for up to E14. We think it prevents clarifying the limit of the blastocyst trophoblasts. Regarding the EPI, your Seurat cluster C0 is partly representative of the blastocyst EPI but also clearly captures early PrE cells and post-implantation EPI (E10). Increasing the cluster resolution would be essential to obtain clusters that better capture the blastocyst EPI. Although it is not clear if the cells of in vitro cultured blastocyst truly progress as expected, we believe that including the C7 and C9 space to define ELCs, when you are evaluating a model of the blastocyst, is misleading. Instead of focusing on the stages, you have rather focused on the lineages. However, the amniotic and mesoderm cells originate from the EPI. As such, treating the amnion and mesoderm (although it includes some extraembryonic mesoderm that might not originate from the EPI) as cell types outside of the 3 lineages makes your analysis ambiguous. This is especially true for Extended Data Fig.2b, in which you classify the cells into the following families: ELC, HLC, TLC, MeLC, AMLC, and Undefined. This classification mixes both the stages and the lineages. For example, MeLCs is the descendant of the EPI lineage at a post-implantation stage and thus represent the same lineage, but they are represented in an independent bar. On the contrary, the bar with the TLCs includes both pre- and post-implantation trophoblasts from the same lineage but different stages. It would be better to use only one parameter, either lineage or stage, for this graph. If you use lineages, the MeLC bar, and arguably the AMLCs, bar should be added on top of the EPI bar. Overall, we think that identifying the stages and the tissues, including the polar TE, the mural TE, the blastocyst EPI, the post-implantation/pre-gastrulation EPI would be a great achievement to benchmark the models. We think it might need a feasible refinement of your analysis, similar to the analysis that led you to uncover X dampening and the polar/mural states in human blastocyst (Petropoulos et al. 2016). A third concern is that you are making statements about the quality of the models based on the ratios between the different cell types (e.g., EPI, TE, PrE) present in the scRNAseq datasets. It is known that blastocysts contain more TE than EPI, and more EPI than PrE (Niakan and Eggan 2013). This was also measured and recapitulated in our model (see Figure 1H, ~60%/35%/5%) using immunofluorescence, and thus based on the expression of selected marker proteins. However, these ratios are not similar in the scRNAseq datasets, with a prominence of EPI as compared to TE. This unbalance cannot be due to a delay in trophoblast specification because the number of trophoblasts was measured within blastoids at the protein level and the RNA precedes the protein. A most likely explanation is that the numbers and ratios in the scRNAseq data do not reflect the ones in the blastoids because there are biases due to the dissociation and sorting processes that precede the sequencing. We believe you have also observed in the blastocysts that, upon dissociation, they release a majority of TE and only a few EPI. As such, evaluating the quality of blastoids based on the numbers in the scRNAseq dataset is probably not justified, unless you have another explanation that we did not grasp from your text. In figure 2C, it would make it more clear if the title would explain that this pseudo-bulk is based on 187 TE, TSC and Amnion genes. Finally, the neural network (NN) approach was confusing for us. We definitely commend you for using new tools, however, we think it should be better explained in order to clearly understand the results that are presented. We understand that space constraints might limit the expansion of this part of your manuscript. As it is presently presented, we understand that your NN analysis yields somehow contradictory results than the UMAPs. The data points at the possibility that we have formed cells transcriptionally resembling the blastocyst EPI. For example, on your UMAP, our ELCs are shifting from the PXGL hPSCs space to the blastocyst EPI space, which suggests that the blastoid environment might normalize their transcriptome. These ELC are also within the KLF17/SUSD2/IFITM1/PRDM14-high space, which are blastocyst-stage EPI markers [PMID: 29361568]. We are surprised that, using your NN, some of those cells were attributed a primitive streak identity. It would be highly informative to know which cells have changed fates, and the gene signatures associated with this. Doing so systematically for all cells “re-annotated” seems an important improvement to guide the biologist through your analysis (just like you did to explain how you re-annotated some of Tyser et al or Xiang et al samples). We are convinced you have thought about it, but it might be suited to add figures showing that the NN did not make use of other parameters to attribute cell fates, such as the read depth, which varies a lot between datasets. For example, Yanagida et al., comprises cells with >6000 genes/cell whereas the Kagawa et al. dataset includes cells >2000 genes/cells. The datasets used for the training are typically using cells with > 3000 genes per cell. The percentage of mitochondrial genes could also have had an important influence. Overall, this might lead to non-comparable datasets. Also, it is difficult to have a clear idea of “off-target” samples. It would help if you would provide a number next to the predicted off-target cells reflecting the percentage as compared to the total number of cells. Finally, how did you control that your reference samples were large enough? Specifically, using ~25 cells from the Tyser et al. dataset as a reference for the amnion is probably not sufficient. Also, the depth of identification of amnion cells or extraembryonic mesoderm cells is really sparse in the peri-implantation dataset, which might be a better reference, as they are closer to the fate transitions that are being modeled. In summary, although the NN is an important tool for the future, we are wondering if the current quality of both the embryo and the models datasets are sufficient. Thank you for considering those points.

I am not an expert in this field but am very interested in the topic. Overall I enjoyed reading the paper and feel like I learned a lot from it. My summary of the paper (to see if I “got it”): the authors raise the question of how PIP2 is involved in so many cellular processes and propose testing the hypothesis that PIP2 is organized into separate spatial domains that carry out different functions. The authors note the correlation that PIP2 is enriched at different functional sites but also that it is not clear whether PIP2 is upstream or downstream from any particular function. I began to get confused at around line 64 (version 1 of the paper) where the authors make some distinction about lipid rafts vs other types of structures that PIP2 might regulate (for example, on line 65 where they say “could this regulate”, I was unsure of what “this” referred to). Ultimately, I understand the question of the paper to be about whether or not PIP2 movement in the plasma membrane is slowed when it is in functional membrane domains as one might expect it to be. They note that PIP2 has been found to move rapidly but based on measurements of bulk PIP2 movement. They also note that, in extracellular lipids, the cytoskeleton has been shown to slow diffusion and this is a key justification of their hypothesis but without looking up the referenced papers I am very unsure about what this means. Finally they describe their approach to the problem - the use of sptPALM to monitor single particles - and briefly describe their results. The authors begin the description of their results by noting that they are monitoring “free” PIP2 that is bound to sensor molecules, since binding to the sensor prevents binding to effector proteins - an important point that is nicely reinforced by Figure 1. The authors note that biosensor-bound PIP2 has the same diffusion coefficient as free PIP2 which is very surprising. The authors spend some time establishing the rigor of their technique which I found, as someone who knows very little about it, to be convincing and comforting. A key assay is whether or not the diffusion is Brownian in nature, or if it is not (i.e. affected by something). I got a little lost in the description of the results in the paragraph starting at line 140 thinking that the conclusion is that the dynamics are mostly Brownian but there are some differences. At line 183 the authors note a deficiency in the mean diffusion coefficient– that it will not detect trajectories with different classes. I’m intrigued but a little confused - in other words, different collections of trajectories could yield the same “D” - interesting! The author’s solution is to calculate D for different classes of trajectories. Overall the main result so far is that PIP2-biosensory movement is mostly unhindered, but a small amount is potentially hindered. The next section is about how specific cellular membrane structures influence PIP2-biosensor movement. The first result is the PIP2-biosensor complex is not hindered at ER-PM contact sites. The authors introduce a control involving chemically induced dimerization of the biosensor but I was somewhat confused as to what this experiment as actually controlling for. They show that they can detect hindered movement but my confusion may arise because that wasn’t something that I considered to be an issue. Ultimately they find that PIP2-biosensor dynamics seem to be the same in most cortical structures but not in spectrin and septin containing structures- a very interesting result! Conclusion: I found this to be a very interesting study with many interesting results. I was somewhat confused by the presentation. For example, the abstract states, “how a single class of lipid molecules independently regulate so many parallel processes remains an open question” but I’m not sure that this question is being addressed in the paper. My takeaway is that the paper asks if the dynamics of free PIP2 (PIP2-biosensor complexes) is the same in different cortical structures as it is outside of them. The answer seems to be that for the most part it is and that the data and arguments presented in the paper make a convincing case for this. Making the paper more clear about what it is really about (if my takeaway is correct), and also discussing what factors might influence whether or not free PIP2 would move through cortical structures freely, could be helpful improvements to readers. Minor comment - The statement “PIP2 is master regulator of plasma membrane function” confused me. Similarly “a single class of master regulatory molecule: the lipid PIP2” - why is it a single “class",2022-01-14T19:43:50,kenprehoda,Ken Prehoda,10.1101/2022.01.07.475414,"Free diffusion of PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane in the presence of high density effector protein complexes","Jonathan Pacheco, Anna C.

The survey asked respondents about their motivations for posting preprints -or not- for the papers they published in scientific journals the previous five years. The main additions compared to earlier surveys on the topic relate to the fact that the survey asked for answers according to whether the respondent was a corresponding author or a co-author on the paper(s), and that for the group of respondents who had posted preprints for some papers but not others, the survey asked about any differences between the papers (e.g. on self-reported novelty or quality of the work), to establish whether a selection bias by authors may take place when making decisions on what papers to post as preprints. The results around motivations for posting preprints correlate with the results of earlier surveys: main motivations are quick dissemination of research and increasing awareness of the research. The respondents also reported an expectation that posting the preprint would bring a benefit in terms of online dissemination of the work e.g. via social media. The survey responses according to whether the author acted as corresponding author or not are interesting as they suggest that preprinting decisions are mostly driven by researcher choice: a higher proportion of respondents posted preprints when they acted as corresponding author, compared to a lower proportion when they were a co-author, as this involved less autonomy in decision making. The preprint landscape in the life sciences has changed hugely in the last two years. The survey was carried out in early 2020 for authors who had published a preprint in the 2013-2018 period, and it is likely that many researchers previously not familiar with preprints are now at least aware of this publication model. It would thus not be surprising if trends have evolved since the survey was done, a follow-up survey (as a follow-up study) would be informative and allow for an interesting exploration of trends around motivations and decision making for preprint use in biological sciences. Specific points -------------- I am not sure I agree with the interpretation that the responses displayed in Figure 8 are at odds with each other. Even if an author considers the papers with and without preprint of similar novelty/quality, I do not think it is surprising for them to have an expectation that the preprint may boost attention/citations, for several reasons: prior research has noted an association between having a preprint and levels of attention/citations, the fact that the preprint disseminates the work earlier and thus may start accruing citations earlier, there is a preprint community on Twitter so the author may expect wider dissemination via those community channels. Survey design - It may be interesting to learn more about how the survey was developed? Were the questions chosen according to the authors’ knowledge or were question options from earlier surveys considered? Was the questionnaire pilot tested prior to deploying the survey, and if so, were any changes made to the wording of specific questions? Analysis of free-text comments - Is there some context/justification for having a single coder for the comments? Was the option of additional coders considered to check for any differences between coders/reduce potential bias? I realize the sample size for certain disciplines may be too small but I wondered about some discipline-level analysis for the responses. Different disciplines are at different stages of use and experimentation with preprints so there may be discipline-level differences on whether authors are making choices based on the perceived quality or novelty of their paper. The qualitative comments note that some authors choose to preprint as protection from scooping while others choose not to preprint due to fear of being scooped, I wondered if views here may be driven by discipline-level variation in use of preprints, i.e. if in my discipline preprinting is common, I may be more likely to preprint as a scooping-protection approach than the opposite. This goes beyond the scope of this paper, but may be a follow-up exploration. There is a thorough discussion of the limitations of the survey, a few additional items for consideration: - This is a survey based on self-reported responses, it may be worth noting that there is no stipulated benchmark for quality or novelty, and thus this may introduce nuance or subjectivity in how the question around novelty or quality is interpreted. - The survey was run in March-April 2020, when there were lockdowns in place in different countries, may lockdown measures have affected response rates by certain groups (certain locations, gender) particularly impacted by lockdowns? - It is noted that the survey is focused on a single preprint server, there are different preprint servers for biological sciences, it may also be relevant in the future to explore comparisons across servers for biology. Even within biological sciences there may be differences between authors who post to preprint servers directly, and those who post preprints via deposition offered by publishers at the stage of journal submission.",2022-01-14T16:09:05,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2021.09.07.459259,"Motivations, concerns and selection biases when posting preprints: a survey of bioRxiv authors","Nicholas Fraser, Philipp Mayr, Isabella Peters",2021-09-07

Indeed the authors are assessing spawning activity in aquatic species based on environmental DNA which is a non-invasive methodological approach of research for monitoring spawning activity on aquatic species. They studied on two medaka species (Oryzias latipes and O. sakaizumii,  in cross experiments and under laboratory conditions. They proposed an environmental DNA approach for monitoring and understanding spawning activity in fish. Their results are suggestive that an eDNA spike occurred in only male species after spawning activity AND THAT the magnitude of the eDNA spike was dependent on the number of spawning activities. They also demonstrated that spikes in the eDNA concentration are mainly caused by the release of sperm during spawning activity, and it can be used as evidence of spawning in field survey. Although the whole experimental design seems clear and straightforward, I would suggest that care should be taken intro account when interpreting laboratory -based finding into filed results. It would be also interesting to extend the discussion part about whether stress related behavioural responses or eDNA concentrations could be related to daily activities and also does personality may matter at all?  In terms of data reproducibility it would be also helpful if the author provide the data accessible on online repository services for further post research examination by other researchers.",2022-01-12T16:41:58,disqus_99pqQa0Hsc,Saeed Sh,10.1101/2020.01.28.924167,Identifying spawning activity in aquatic species based on environmental DNA spikes,"Satsuki Tsuji, Naoki Shibata",2020-02-29
