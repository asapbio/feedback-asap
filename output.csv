Even if the code was there it would be difficult to reproduce – stata is not very widely used. Does the analysis decisively link badger culling to decline in bovine TB in cattle? Culling is confounded with complex changes to gamma and other testing and other measures. There are places in the ms where a claim is made for a link ‘The effect of badger culling…’ but then later:  ‘However, this data analysis cannot explicitly distinguish…….’ APHA have stated more than once that the breakdown data alone are insufficient to show an effect of culling. However, the DID approach is inappropriate because the 52 cull and pre-cull study areas are surrounded by and in close contact with each other and so are not adequately discrete in space and time, breaking a DID requirement. Notably in the four-year period 2016/17 -2019/20 pre-cull and cull areas closely juxta position. Pre-cull and cull interventions may influence change in adjacent pre-cull and cull areas in an irregular and unpredictable manner, via the constant movement of cattle with different intervention histories. Some of the very important bTB testing controls used and the timing of their introduction are not correctly described and some not even mentioned. The approach mixes data from 46 High Risk Area study areas with 6 from the Edge Area. These have very different epidemiological and disease control history profiles and the reason for mixing them is not explained. Pre-cull gamma testing was intense in the Edge Area. While the manuscript mentions additional gamma testing from 2017, gamma testing was erratic between areas and over time. There were considerable numbers of gamma reactors in many of the cull areas in cull years 1 and 2 with similar disclosures to years 3 and 4 but pre-cull use in the HRA was generally low. In both HRA and Edge areas OTFW incidence was declining when many of the additional disease control rules were intensified, and badger culling introduced. The government chief scientist view was that distinguishing and determining with any precision any contribution of badger culling to disease control is not possible, is therefore maintained. It is impossible to distinguish between the effects of badger culling and disease control measures using the DID approach in any meaningful way. The comment made on being unable to match cull and control is unevidenced and a 2022 published and peer reviewed study of this has not been cited, nor alternative approaches such as matching a series of individual farms in cull and control which would have been simpler and easier to monitor on a quarterly basis since 2018, as was the expectation of a High Court ruling. The suggestion that incidence is the better indicator of true burden goes against APHA’s own epidemiology and the greatly clarified understanding of SICCT test sensitivity and specificity. The specificity change resulting from SICCT severe interpretation can be estimated and applied to OTFS, providing, with OTFW, a safe index of known infection. Gamma testing has shown numbers of unidentified reactors in both identified bTB infected and unidentified herds, and this ‘hidden’ reservoir remains undocumented although its size can be deduced. OTFW relates by its nature to older infections with lesions, yet it is newer infections (OTFS) that indicate disease control success (elimination) more accurately, over time. There is no reason to believe that OTFS+OTFW (as above) is not the superior approach and that OTFW is half of the full picture. During the RBCT, prevalence was growing considerably and OTFS rising so the analogy made in this manuscript is inappropriate and trying unconvincingly to defend the historic reference source. By reducing the pre-cull analysis to one data point the significant pre-cull decline is hidden and this also masks true trends. Because the methods are inappropriate, the results are flawed and the conclusions are flawed. There is no way to distinguish between different interventions and change in herd breakdowns since 2013 with the approach taken. There is also need to see clarification of the analysis that is presented in the Appendix – this does not seem to  be the output from the constrained DID analysis, but something else not fully described in methods which  ‘matches’ it  – which stata  process was used ? It is the first analysis referred to in the main text. As well as showing that the BCP effect accounts for less than 2% of breakdowns it doesn’t look quite right that the BCP effect is based on error dof – pseudoreplication?",2023-10-10T13:37:06,disqus_mgwPkHbXfP,Tom Langton,10.1101/2023.09.04.556191,Difference in Differences analysis evaluates the effects of the Badger Control Policy on Bovine Tuberculosis in England,"Colin P.D.

This pattern, however, have been already stated in a recent study (Veron et al. 2019). In this sense, the discussion about the processes involved in the origin of such floras could be improved by the ideas presented by Vasconcelos et al. (2021). In this study, the authors propose that the terms neoendemism and paleoendemism should be replaced by assessment in relation to the actual biogeographic and macroevolutionary processes that had occurred. Moreover, although the authors provide a methodological discussion regarding the scale of the areas analyzed, a stronger emphasis should be put on it. Several large continental areas, for instance, represent large vegetation domains (i.e., Mata Atlântica and Cerrado), which include high number of endemism however unevenly scattered in island-like habitats throughout these areas. 1.

The three hypotheses proposed (lines 171 - 185) has been described as the predicted associations, reflecting correlation patterns instead of the causal mechanisms leading to those patterns. As an example of correlation, in discussion (line 437), the authors report that the higher taxonomic, functional, and spectral diversity found at middle elevations has already been tested all over the world. Could the focus of the hypotheses be stated as the process(es) behind these patterns instead of the correlations per se? 2. The species Phacelia secunda was selected to analyze intraspecific trends between traits and environment, based on the fact that it is present across the elevation gradient (line 224). It would be interesting to know if Phacelia secunda is the only species occurring along the all elevation gradient. If not, why the authors selected it specifically?

In figure 2, I have seen cell-expressions for BEpC, MAIT, and F were not showed in the b figure because I saw some significant changes in between phase for those expressions and it would be nice to see them within the plot as well. In addition to figure 3, might as well of showing the scRNA-seq data in other cell-type expressions of Tgfb2 and correlate them with their most corresponding expressions within each of the organ.

We have attempted a similar approach to understand the evolution of conserved viral protein domains, and found that the alignments generated by Foldseek for our particular dataset were of insufficient quality to generate a reliable phylogenetic tree. We also tried to generate alignments using 3Di sequences, but again struggled to generate reliable alignments due to divergence.

I will refer to the energy-minimized structures as ""relaxed"" and otherwise ""unrelaxed"". In this work I only analyzed the relaxed structures. There were so many different things to check that I never got round to checking the effect of energy minimization originally, but I did make sure to save all of the unrelaxed structures. So I re-ran some of the analyses (originally done on the relaxed structures) with the unrelaxed structures. (1: Structure correlations) When comparing AF-PDB correlations for pairs of structures where sequences differ by 1-3 mutations, relaxed and unrelaxed structures give almost identical results. For the case of no mutations, the correlations are actually higher for unrelaxed structures (r=0.38) compared to relaxed structures (r=0.33). This would reduce the residual correlations in Figure 1H by about 0.05. For reference, in Figure 1H the residual AF-PDB correlations range from about 0.15 to 0.35. (2: Blue fluorescence correlation) I checked the strongest AF-phenotype correlation, from Figure 2C. For unrelaxed I get r = -0.92, for relaxed I get r = -0.93. It seems that the energy minimization does help, but it is certainly a minor part of the overall prediction. Bear in mind that this analysis is nowhere near as extensive as what went into the paper, so I might have missed something. The paper has now been accepted, so I don't think it is possible to add this in a new version. Thanks again for asking this important question. I'm personally glad to know the answer (even if it is a bit preliminary).",2023-10-05T06:23:48,disqus_kHaiH8cKyG,John McBride,10.1101/2022.04.14.488301,AlphaFold2 can predict single-mutation effects,"John M.

LIVe hosts an activity called the ""Preprint Club,"" where we select preprints for reading and critical review. I have chosen your preprint: ""The Penetration of Sunflower Root Tissues by the Parasitic Plant Orobanche cumana Wallr. is Intracellular."" This is an interesting, well-written, and well-illustrated paper describing a robust and scientifically sound study. The study demonstrates that intrusive cells invade living host cells intracellularly, leading to the degradation of the cell wall. These results can contribute to the selection of candidate genes for resistance to the parasitic plant Orobanche cumana. In our discussion of the paper, we have some suggestions for you to consider. In general, the mechanism of intracellular and extracellular penetration of haustorium has been discussed in parasitic plants. Therefore, we suggest that the main contribution of the article to the state of the art of parasitic plants should be made clear in the introduction, discussion, and conclusion. Title Line 2: I suggest including the name of the sunflower species and the plant families in the title, and removing the full stop. Line 5: What is the authors' affiliation? I suggest including this information. Key message Line 12: Please check the species name Helianthus annus L. It looks like a letter ""u"" ( Helianthus annu u s L.) is missing. Line 17: I suggest removing Orobanche cumana from the keywords, as it is already in the title, and adding another keyword to broaden the scope of article search. Introduction Line 42: I suggest including the author of Orobanche cumana. Line 43: Remove the comma. Line 44: Which component of the root exudates are you referring to? Could you specify? Line 54: Could you please provide the full name of the gene? Line 57: I believe it's important to specify how the phloem connection is established, as it has received less coverage in the literature compared to xylem connection. Line 72: I suggest leaving only 'Orobanchaceae' in the parentheses. Line 74: For standardization, include the family name 'Pelargonium zonale' and remove 'family' from the parentheses for 'Convolvulaceae.' The ending 'aceae' already indicates the family."" Materials and methods What is the sample number? I suggest including light microscopy and Toluidine Blue O staining analyzes in the text. Results and discussion Line 170: Insert a comma after “By contrast” Lines 181-183: I was intrigued by how the nutrient transfer process occurs in the early stages. Do you have any hypotheses? Figures: It would be interesting to insert an acronym in the figures indicating parasite plant (P) and host plant (H), as well as the host and parasitic plant tissues. Figures: I suggest positioning the figures vertically, as the sections are longitudinal. Concluding remarks Could you provide answers to questions 2 and 3 and consider including at least one sentence addressing these questions posed in the introduction? References Lines 243, 286, 292, 294: Please check the reference pages. Line 254: Please verify whether the journal name should be abbreviated.

I do, however, have some reservations regarding the interpretations of the authors. 1) The authors suggest that individual amino acid residues shared between an allogeneic HLA antigen and a self-HLA antigen should be viewed as “self.” I view this act of classification as problematic. When a donor HLA antigen differs by one or more amino acids from a host HLA antigen encoded at the same locus, the entire protein is classified, at least from some perspectives routinely adopted in transplantation immunology, as non-self. One way to rationalize this view, which may conflict with the perspective expressed by the authors in this manuscript, is to suggest that what matters in antibody-antigen interaction are the thermodynamic roles of the amino acids that constitute HLA antigens, not their identities. The claim is that the relevant biochemical/biophysical properties of a given shared amino acid at a particular position in the primary structures of the self and allogeneic HLA molecules can be altered meaningfully as a consequence of the one to several amino acid differences between these proteins. For example, a lysine or tryptophan that is oriented slightly differently in the self vs. the allogeneic molecules or that is more or less likely to fluctuate in certain directions is not necessarily thermodynamically equivalent in the two proteins. 2) If the above assertion is accepted, then the claim that breaches of tolerance are critical for damage to the allograft is not demonstrated. While it is of interest to know that self-reactive B cells are generated it is not clear from this study that the antibodies produced by these B cells cause graft damage in vivo. While I acknowledge the evidence that autoreactive anti-A*24:02 antibodies can bind to allogeneic A*01:01 with potentially meaningful intrinsic affinities, that is a necessary but not sufficient condition for contributing meaningfully to clinical allograft tissue damage, especially in the context of a single patient with an autoimmune disease. Experiments designed to test the hypothesis, in a broader range of transplant patients, that such antibodies do contribute to allograft rejection episodes would be of interest. In the context of the potential role of autoantibody responses in allotransplantation, it has been accepted for some years that generation of autoantibodies to a variety of proteins can accompany alloimmune responses to an allograft. Some investigators have offered evidence that the presence of such antibodies is associated with damage to allografts. At present, I do not think we know with certainty the extent to which, if at all, such autoantibodies contribute to allograft damage or whether they can do so in the absence of pathogenic alloantibodies.",2023-10-02T17:42:18,,Neil Greenspan,10.1101/2023.03.31.534734,B cell and antibody targeting of transplant alloantigen epitopes is supported by both self and allo-recognition,"John T.

We collectively agreed it's an exciting contribution to understanding how biological invasions shape invasive species' trophic niche and functional morphology in new environmental contexts. We all think the manuscript is well written and the figures are excellent! During our discussion, a major point that came up deals with how the hypothesis (lines 88-90) is motivated and then connected with the results. A more conceptual contextualization of the hypothesis in the introduction (e.g., explaining the ecological release hypothesis in the 3rd paragraph) could help readers to generalize the results beyond the study system and attract a more diverse readership interested in niche variation and biological invasions. Also, as the results combine a substantial body of statistical analyses aiming to understand variation in functional morphology and trophic niches across species, ontogenetic stages, sexes, and invaded vs. native ranges, presenting predictions after the hypotheses could help readers to navigate the results. For example, in light of the ecological release hypothesis, what is expected regarding morphological and body size variation across native and invaded areas? Our final point of discussion is related to the interpretation of the observed niche contraction in the invaded range. As replicates representing invaded vs. native ranges are sampling sites in space (Fig. 1), clarifying whether observed niche contraction emerges via lower variability in resource use across sites and/or within sites would be interesting. This is a key point to connect the results with the ecological release hypothesis. I hope you find these comments constructive; discussing this manuscript in our journal club was great.

We collectively agreed it's an exciting contribution towards a more efficient and comprehensive use of camera traps as a powerful tool to monitor biodiversity. We appreciated the concerns the authors had to create a user-friendly and flexible approach, which will certainly appeal to a diverse public of ecologists and wildlife biologists. As tropical ecologists, most of the questions that came up during our discussion were related to applying this approach to tropical, species-rich ecosystems. For instance, we wondered whether models would perform similarly (e.g., classification accuracy) in megadiverse communities where the local pool of species is larger and morphological variation (both across and within species) may also be amplified. Would this imply having a more robust training set? We understand this is not something trivial to predict based on the current set of species, but a deeper exploration of how species' traits influence prediction accuracies would be very welcome in this direction. For example, does the model have lower performance for species with smaller body sizes and/or coloration more similar to the background? Or perhaps within groups of species that are more similar in size? We also wondered whether detection and classification accuracy varies across diurnal and nocturnal records, which could bias predictions.

While the overarching theme is commendable, there are certain aspects that warrant attention and further refinement: Although the purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis of rivers acting as barriers to gene flow in Neotropical primates, the introduction excessively focuses on the Amazonia. We suggest to bring the impact of rivers on primates in other Neotropical or global biomes. Additionally, the role of other physiographic barriers in primate structuring has been underexplored. Many statements lack references, some of which are fundamental to the work, such as a source showing primate distributions associated with rivers (lines 84:87) or proposing river width as a proxy for molecular dissimilarity in undersampled areas (lines 116:117). The justification for using mitochondrial DNA markers is weak and exposes limitations that are not exclusive to mtDNA. The line 140 brings confusion about the geographical scope of the study, stating that it would cover only South America and not the Neotropics. The objective 3 proposes to model geographical regions that lack additional taxonomic explorations, but no methodology is proposed for this, and the results and discussion briefly touch on such topic. Overall, there is a lack of clarity in the methodology description, and we suggest that the authors assume that the analytical details of a scientific paper should prioritize its replicability. Regarding spatial analyses, how accurate are the IUCN Red List distributions for all Platyrrhini species or to what extent were physiographic barriers used as estimates to define the boundaries of these polygons? Also, IUCN specialist maps would probably use rivers as the limit of the distribution for species species and subspecies, thus, testing rivers as barriers using this dataset could potentially be a bit circular. What criteria were used to define ""mountains"" (a threshold for altitude? Topographic roughness? Any reference?). In the case of Andean Mountains for example, instead of separating sister species-pairs, the separation could be older and at the genus level. It is also inappropriate to consider the width of the river at the midpoint of the species boundary, as organisms could potentially cross it at any point, especially where the river is narrower. It is also unclear how (or if) the effects of geographical distance on genetic divergence (isolation by distance) were controlled. Regarding molecular analyses, does the quantity and spatial extent of sampling adequately represent the distribution and haplotypes of species? Could taxonomic uncertainties be affecting these data? Is the locality of these sequences described as geographic coordinates or the name of the sampling site? How were the data linked to species: were DNA sequences obtained from taxonomic studies confirming identification or the authors verified the respective collected specimen? Were phylogenetic topologies and genetic distances inferred considering which nucleotide substitution models? Was any analysis of model selection per partition performed (e.g., PartitionFinder)? If not, some justification is needed for the methodology chosen. Maps of sampling points and phylogenetic trees would greatly facilitate the overall interpretation of  results, mainly Figure 3. Furthermore, it is important to explicitly assume the expected topology for a scenario in which the river promoted speciation. Would it be reciprocal monophyly? Additionally, we suggest that the results of genetic dissimilarity and statistical analyses be placed in a table (lines 289 to 308). The lack of phylogenetic support listed in ""Suspect taxonomy"" should be interpreted with caution, as it may present analytical biases related to the use of few mitochondrial sequences considering inappropriate nucleotide substitution models. We miss the integration between the results and the literature. Much of the early discussion refers to a redundant description of results (lines 374:404), followed by information about the dispersion of Platyrrhini across rivers. We suggest that these two sections could be worked cohesively and in a complementary manner. The link between the low phylogenetic support in areas without geographical barriers and the suggestion of incorporating geographical barriers into taxonomic descriptions is not clear. The low supports ""when no geographical barriers was evident"" may reflect deficient haplotype sampling in these areas, since molecular sampling is generally denser near rivers than interfluves in Amazonia. Finally, a point brought up in the Abstract but missing from the discussion is that the findings of the study suggest that the formation of riverine barriers coincides with speciation events, but nowhere are the dates of river formation or species diversification mentioned. Such an interpretation should be avoided since the genetic structuring can be promoted by rivers in vicariant or secondary contact contexts.",2023-09-30T14:04:49,chouerik,Erik Choueri,10.1101/2023.07.23.550208,The Role of Rivers as Geographical Barriers in Shaping Genetic Differentiation and Diversity of Neotropical Primates,"William D.

For example, a sanity check using IBS or even something like qpWave in cladality mode would have shown that WHG is NOT more related to Southeast Asians and Indians than to Near-Eastern populations. The same applies to other maps in figure 5. Most scientists tend to forget the basic principles of ancestry proportions, to wit, ancestry proportions will change based on how distal or proximal the sources are to the target individuals. The accuracy of the calculations depends on how closely the actual sources align with the test sources. For example, in their admixture calx the authors use sources such as ANF and CHG which are more proximal to Near-Easterners than to SE Asians and Indians to infer WHG proportions. Although arguably ANF and CHG are important sources for Near-Easterners, they’re not for SE Asians. That’s why figure 5 incorrectly shows WHG higher in SE Asians than in Near-Easterners. Had the authors used more proximal sources such as South Asian or SE Asian Hunter gatherers, then the result would have been lower WHG in SE Asians than Near-Easterners which would have been correct. In conclusion, authors should not use a admixture proportions to infer relatedness between two populations. One-to-one comparison methods such as IBS, IBD, or qpWave with a proper set of outgroups will yield much more accurate results.",2023-09-30T10:46:37,disqus_dmoTb81ODP,Dilawer Khan,10.1101/2022.05.04.490594,Population Genomics of Stone Age Eurasia,"Morten E.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.05.556422v2#comment-6289178522,biorxivstage,1,"The pre-print Kim et al. [1] shows promising pharmacodynamic data for an LRA (Galunisertib, given as 20 mg/kg for 14 days, in multiple cycles) to purge the SIV reservoir in HAART treated SIV infected monkeys. They corroborate the finding with the use of a radiolabeled anti-env imaging probe, which the authors claim can be used to detect tissue areas of increased viral replication in the body when the probe uptake in those areas increases. This radiolabeled probe was already used in a 2022 publication [2] from the same team (Samer et al. JCI-Insight, reference number 35 of the Kim et al. pre-print [1]), to show the increase in SIV viral production in monkeys treated with HAART following the LRA administration given for a shorter period of time at lower doses (5-10 mg/kg for 7 days). In the 2023 pre-print, however, the first cycle of the LRA did not induce those very high increases in probe uptake in lymph nodes or the gut of animals as reported in the 2022 [2] paper in which the animals received the LRA at lower doses for a shorter period compared to the 2023 pre-print [1]. Why higher doses and longer duration of the LRA in 2023 are not revealing those high increases in probe uptake seen in the 2022 paper? One possible explanation is that those high increases in SUV uptakes seen in the 2022 paper are the result of non-specific uptake of the probe, based on certain details of the 2022 published images (more in note-*1). The latter seems a reasonable explanation for the Samer et al. paper [2] given that the LRA showed a systemic effect (see Suppl Fig S6 in Samer et al., in which the effect of the LRA is measured in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells), hence it is unlikely that the red spots in the PET images show up only in the Axillary cluster of lymph nodes ipsilateral to the injection sites and not in any other lymph nodes clusters in the body. See for instance video 3 and video 4 of the [2] paper in the links repasted below for quick access (under note-1*), the two animals with the highest increase in Lymph nodes uptakes show red spots only in the Axillary nodes ipsilateral to the injection sites, but not on the opposite site of the Axillary nodes nor in other lymph nodes clusters of the body, such as the inguinal lymph nodes. The authors however showed that the LRA did induce an increase in viral replication from PCR of inguinal nodes tissues shown in Table 2 and Fig 4A of [2]. For instance, the A14X064 showed ~100 fold increase in CAVL-RNA in inguinal nodes, yet from video 4 https://insight.jci.org/art... the only nodes that light up in red in the PET images are the Left Axillary nodes ipsilateral to the extravasation of the injection site on the Left arm of the monkey. Lack of increase in specific binding of the probe in the lymph nodes, despite the evidence of increase in viral RNA in some of those tissues based on PCR, points to a lack of reproducibility of the anti-env imaging system, or, at most, to a poor sensitivity of the imaging system. On the other hand, this lack of reproducibility that comes across by comparing the 2022 and 2023 imaging data, which are based on previous two publications from the same imaging team in 2015 [3] and 2018 [4], questions indeed those earlier two nonhuman primates papers [3, 4] too, in which the authors showed evidence that this imaging system is capable of detecting residual levels of viral replication in HAART treated animals, the latter being an attribute of an imaging systems very sensitive to detect changes in target (gp120) molarity. The latter consideration assumes that the binding affinities of the radiolabeled F(ab’)2 fragment of the 7d3 used in [1, 2] and the radiolabeled 7d3 used in [3, 4] are similar, which seems a fair assumption based on what is implied in the Methods sections of the [1, 2] articles, although in vitro binding data have not been reported in the [1, 2] articles (more in note-*2). Similarly, there is no evidence of increase in gut SUV levels after the first two weeks of Galunisterib administration in the 2023 pre-print Kim et al. [1]. This contrasts with the observation reported in the 2022 [2] of a substantial increase in gut uptake seen for instance in animals (A14X027 (video 1) or A14X013 (video 7) or A14X064 (video 4)) after only one week of the LRA administered at lower doses for shorter periods compared to the [1] 2023 study in pre-print. An alternative explanation for the increase in gut radiotracer uptake seen in the 2022 paper is that the increase in bowel uptake reflects a well-known phenomenon of non-specific intraluminal uptake of the radiolabeled antibody\F(ab’)2 fragments [5, 6] (see more under note-*3.1)). In other words, the hypothesis that the increases in probe uptake in lymph nodes and the gut seen in the 2022 paper after the first LRA-cycle are fully explained by non-specific uptake of the probe appears consistent with the lack of increase in probe uptake in the same anatomic compartments in the 2023 study in which animals received the same LRA at higher doses for longer periods of time. Finally, another important difference between the 2022 [2] and the 2023 [1] imaging data is that in the latter [1], the increase in probe uptake (given as SUV, standardized uptake value) is now seen in the lymph nodes, gut (and many other regions of the body, the latter a feature that points to a non-specific nature of the biodistribution) at later cycles of the LRA administration, when also the heart (blood pool) probe uptake is increasing, which is happening in all animals at the later cycles of [1]. As described by mathematicians in the 80’s, when changes in input function take place, the use of the SUV to quantitate changes in probe uptake could be misleading and requires mathematical modeling of the time activity curves generated in serial imaging along with an input function [7], or at least a normalization on the blood pool (heart). This phenomenon of the increase in heart uptake (which indicates blood pool) following Galunisertib administration was not noted in the animals of the [2] publication. Only in one animal of the previous 2022 publication, the authors claimed increase in the radiotracer uptake of the heart. However, the figures and videos associated to this particular animal (A14X004) reveal a potentially important inconsistency, as described under note-*3.2. It would be helpful, in general, to standardize measurements of covariates generated in different labs, especially in studies that are closely related to each other like the [1] and [2] studies. Note under note-*4 lack of standardization in measurements of CAVL viral RNA and CAVL viral DNA between [2] and [1] studies. Notes and Bibliography note-*1. Figure 3H of [2] shows that the highest increases in lymph node (LN) uptake are in monkeys A14X060, A14X064, and A14X013. In these animals, PET images show clear evidence of significant extravasation of the injected probe into the subcutaneous tissues ipsilateral to the high LN uptake. A fourth animal (A14X027) has a slight increase in LN uptake with smaller extravasation. The four animals above are 4 of the 5 animals that the authors claim in the Abstract of [2] show increase in probe uptakes in lymph nodes caused by the administration of the LRA. It is well known, however, that when radiolabeled antibodies\fragments are intentionally or unintentionally (infiltration) administered by subcutaneous or intradermal route, they find their way into the lymphatics and then non-specifically concentrate in regional draining nodes [8], as it appears to be the case for the animals listed above since the radiotracer uptake in LNs was much higher on the side of infiltration than the contralateral side or than in distant nodes. For this reason, the SUV analysis should not have included those LNs in Figure 3H. Without those LNs, however, it looks like from the published images that there is no increase in probe uptake in the LNs, as claimed in the abstract of [2] in which a causal link between Galunisertib administration and increase in LNs in probe uptake is inferred from the data analysis.

[2] we read “The 64Cu-DOTA-F(ab′)2 p7D3 was previously validated in SIV-uninfected macaques (62)”, with ref 62 being ref [3] of this document. In the pre-print Kim et al. for the characterization of the probe the Samer et al. [2] reference is provided. However, in ref [3] only the intact 64Cu-DOTA-7D3 and not the F(ab’)2 was tested in vitro in data presented in  Suppl Figure S1 of [3]. In particular, Suppl Fig S1C of [3] shows approximately 2-fold only difference in radiotracer uptake in a competition assay using gp120 expressing cell lines, that are known to express gp120 at much higher levels than primary cells (e.g. pbmc, spleen or lymph node cells). Of note, the competition assay of S1C shows rapid loss in binding when the radiotracer is incubated with only 25% more of the non-radiolabeled (cold) ligand, which is unexpected for high affinity binding ligands. All these four imaging NHP studies [1-4], produced by the same imaging team, lack autoradiography analyses. The latter ex-vivo technique generates powerful data for the in vivo inference, as typically done in oncological pre-clinical research, because, as mathematicians have shown when they first attempted to extract quantitative information from the PET images [7], what the in vivo imaging is revealing is not a signal proportional to the absolute concentration of the target, but rather a signal that is proportional to the binding capacity of the probe, which is the product of the probe affinity times the concentration of the target. The implication is that if the latter is very low, we can have in our hands a very high affinity ligand, yet we will not be able to generate an SUV level that is predominantly explained by specific binding of the probe. In absence of autoradiography data, some evidence of binding capacity can be generated by implementing in vitro cell binding assays using primary cells (e.g. PBMC or splenocytes or lymph node cells from infected animals and compare the binding to same cells from uninfected animals). This was done only in the first publication [3] in Nature Methods, in which a two-fold (only) difference in SUV uptake was observed by comparing uninfected and infected spleen and lymph node cells (S1B) ex vivo incubated with the radiotracer. However, the binding data were generated using cryopreserved cells without cold-competition assays; the latter would be useful to rule out, for instance, putative higher non-specific uptake due to higher cell death in the infected cells following their thawing. In general, it  would be helpful to increase the sample size of S1B of the 2015 publication [3] (for instance only one well for uninfected lymph node cells were used for that piece of data, which precludes any robust conclusion from the data), as well as to produce autoradiography studies, as mentioned above, in which tissue sections are incubated with close to kd concentration of the probe and after washing, the tissue sections uptakes are compared to the non-specific uptake generated by pre-incubating the adjacent tissue sections with large amount of the cold (i.e, non-radiolabeled) probe to block all gp120 receptors in the tissue sections. Additional validations of the observed increased SUV uptakes in SIV infected animals, or following the administration of an LRA, as claimed in the 4 NHP publications, is particularly warranted given the state-of-art research in this area and given that, because of the high costs and demanding resources associated to these studies, few laboratories in the world have the capacity of reproducing these experimental data. note-*3.1 The study [2] did not appear to exclude in the analysis of the gut areas that are consistent with the intraluminal antibody excretion in bowel segments, because details of how the gut SUV uptake was obtained were missing from the Methods section of the [2] publication. The new [1] pre-print states “To quantify the signal in the gut tissue, the body segment  below the stomach to above the cervix was initially isolated. The Gut’s SUV was then calculated  by extracting the spleen, both kidneys, liver, and bones within the designated body region using Boolean operations.” The latter approach , if adopted also in the [2] publication with those high levels of gut SUV probe uptake seen soon after cycle 1 in some of the animals, again proves that those areas are consistent with the intraluminal antibody excretion (e.g. stools) in bowel segments were not excluded in the analysis, however, this is not what is commonly done in antibody imaging studies [5], because it is known that this phenomenon of non specific uptake in the gut due to the excretion of these types of radiotracers can occur. note-*3.2 Figure 3F in [2] is a figure obtained from Supplemental Video 5 ( https://insight.jci.org/art...), with baseline and post-LRA images displayed with SUV-rainbow-scale = 0.3 for animal A14X004.  Based on the legends, all other animals are displayed at SUV-scale =1.5. (baseline is before LRA (i.e first panel to the left) and middle and right panels are images at week 1 post LRA for one week and week 2 post-LRA for another week, respectively). Based on the legends, and consistent with the CT anatomy of the Video 5, the Video 8 https://insight.jci.org/art... shows the same images, before subtracting liver and kidney, displayed at 1.5 SUV. If we try to picture how the Video 8 (baseline, left panel) would look like by putting our hand on top of the liver and kidney to mask these two organs, it appears that what is left is an image that is the same image displayed in Video 5 (first panel to the left) or Figure 3F (first panel to the left). However, the legends state that the scales are different for Video5\Fig3F (0-0.3) and Video 8 (0-1.5), hence also the colors of the baseline images of Video 5 and 8 should be the different. In other words, Video 8 and Figure3F\Video 5 are incompatible. The evidence that Video 5 and Video 8 of reference [2] require to be harmonized for the validity of the whole dataset, can be also deduced by looking at the rainbow scale of the images. The rainbow scale goes from black to blue to green to yellow to red. So if we fix it to max SUV=1.5, it means that if an SUV uptake is 1.5 or higher, it will show up as red, and all the other colors would indicate levels below SUV=1.5 …for instance green is around 0.7. Now, if the rainbow is fixed to max Suv=0.3, it means that whatever is 0.3 or higher will be red, and green is in the middle, around 0.15. If Figure 3F\Video 5 is correct but the mistake was done in Video 8 (left panel was set at SUV scale 0.3 instead of 1.5 like written in the legends), then once displayed on a scale 1.5, the left panel of Video 8 should show a liver and kidney in color bluish...(which is not seen in the liver and kidney of any other animals, hence the latter scenario would point to a very fast biodistribution of the probe, which is consistent with a damage of the probe). Two different versions of the Samer et al. paper can be found online, the PMC version and the JCI-Insight version, which differ primarily on the biodistribution of the A14X004 (video 5 and video 8). Some of the differences between JCI-Insight link ( https://insight.jci.org/art... current version online modified in June 2023) and the PMC-link (dated November 2022 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...) are here outlined: A) JCI-I: However, a probe generated using a rhesus IgG1 Fab against an irrelevant antigen 64Cu-DOTA-F(ab′)2 pIgG1 in an SIV-infected macaque was used as further control (Supplemental Figure 8 and Supplemental Video 9). PMC: However, a probe generated using a rhesus IgG1 Fab against an irrelevant antigen 64Cu-DOTA-F(ab′)2 pIgG1 in an SIV-infected macaque was used as further control (Supplemental Figure 8 and Supplemental Video 2). Note, Suppl video 2 in PMC link shows images of A14X037, hence unrelated to the sentence above in the PMC link. B) JCI-I: A smaller increase in the gut was also present in A14X004 and A14X060 (Figure 3G, Supplemental Video 5, and Supplemental Video 8). PMC: A smaller increase in the gut was also present in A14X004 and A14X060 (Figure 3G, Supplemental Video 5, and Supplemental Figure 1). In this case too, Supplemental Figure 1 in PMC link shows figure title TGF-β inhibits HIV-1 latency reactivation by PMA in ACH-2 cells, hence unrelated to sentence in the PMC link. Consistent with the changes above, the supplemental materials in PMC do not show Supplemental Video 8 and Video 9. The videos legend, however, is the same on both links, i.e. points to the existence of additional two videos (called movie S1 and movie S2) in both the PMC and JCI-I links.  None of the two links however call movie S1 or movie S2 in the main text, so this is an editing mistake probably propagated for 3 corrections made on the JCI-Insight publication, the last one dated June 14th 2023 based on the Version History section linked to the publication https://insight.jci.org/art.... C) Video 1 link of the PMC link does not contain the animal ID listed in the legend, but animal A14x004 displayed at 0-1.5 SUV scale (what became Video 8 in the JCI-I link) D) the PMC link date is Nov 2022, the JCI-I link shows that changes were made in June 2023 based on the third upload of the supplementary material file. note-*4.

The text is relevant given the context of climate change and despite the inherent complexity of this subject and the extensive analysis conducted, you effectively guided the discussion in a clear and compelling manner. We also found the research idea and the results obtained to be quite intriguing, showing how different climate variables influence beta diversity and its components. In particular, the taxonomic diversity being more aligned with phylogenetic and functional diversity in the tropics as opposed to temperate and polar regions, is a very interesting finding. That being said, we believe that some of the results could have been further explored in the discussion section and that the introduction could use additional information to highlight the work's importance and clarify some of the choices made, such as more details on why the LGM was chosen for comparison. Below, we provide a list of specific suggestions that we hope could contribute to your work, especially for the clarification of some of the results and methods used and for a more comprehensive discussion section. List of specific comments: The importance of your work and how it relates to current climate change could be further emphasized in the introduction section. It is mentioned that precipitation seasonality was the main variable explaining total beta-diversity. This result could be better explored in the discussion, as it was only briefly mentioned in the results section. Consider integrating some of the limitations identified in the methodology section in the discussion as well. For example, the explanation on how the gaps in the functional traits dataset could affect your results. As it is mentioned in the discussion section, the climate changes that are happening now are different from the changes that happened in the last glaciation. We believe the comparisons made between them and the conclusions reached could be expressed with less certainty. While the importance of conserving a network of protected areas in regions with rare species is indicated in the discussion section, this subject could have received more attention. It's also worth emphasizing in the text that such actions will likely not be enough to stop climate change-driven extinctions on their own. The high beta-diversity in regions such the Sahara transition and the USA is an intriguing result that could be investigated. In the models, the r² values are high for the combined variables, but relatively low for individual variables. The study focuses on the effects of the LGM anomaly, but we believe that a more in-depth exploration of the interactions among the studied variables would be beneficial. We found it unclear what corresponds to a “species” (used in taxonomic diversity) in the context of phylogenetic and functional diversity. Do these correspond to functional and phylogenetic groups? Figure 1a caption is somewhat confusing, as it mentions beta diversity but only shows LGM anomaly. In figures 2 and 4, we recommend that all sub-figures share a consistent scale to facilitate comparisons between them. Figures 2 (j, k and l) and 4 could use a different color scale. Light yellow is especially difficult to discern from the background white. The inclusion of a table with the description of all environmental variables used to compare with beta-diversity might be beneficial to the understanding of the reader. We hope that our suggestions will help in further improving the quality of your work.

The topic is timely, and the manuscript brings a useful tool to build a fast evaluation of the extinction risk for species that have not yet been assessed by the IUCN. The high number of species without conservation status assessment (~82% of all vascular plants) was a big surprise to us, taking this number into account we believe the proposed tool can help to advance in the classification of conservation status. Predictions of extinction risk could help to prioritise assessment efforts for species predicted with high certainty to be threatened and also for species with uncertain predictions, which could be triaged as Data Deficient and prioritised for further fieldwork. We enjoyed reading this manuscript very much, but we have some questions that were raised during a lab meeting planned to discuss this preprint, which we leave below. 1) We know that many new species described in recent years are listed as threatened in the description, however this information is not included in the IUCN Red List. So, our question is, why is this information not reaching the IUCN, what alternatives could be applied to overcome this issue? 2) We saw that it is available a more recent data on the Human Footprint, which is Sanderson et al. but it is a preprint article ( https://doi.org/10.32942/os..., why was this reference not used? 3) In 2017 was published an update on ecoregions, we saw that the changes from Olson et al. 2001 are few, but why did you choose to work with the oldest instead of Dinerstein et al. (2017)? Dinerstein, E., Olson, D., Joshi, A., Vynne, C., Burgess, N. D., Wikramanayake, E., ... & Saleem, M. (2017). An ecoregion-based approach to protecting half the terrestrial realm. BioScience, 67(6), 534-545. We also leave some suggestions to the authors: 1)  	It would be interesting to map the results by biome (the results were shown by botanical country, Fig. 2). It is our belief that the species in the botanical country of Northeastern Brazil are from the Atlantic Forest (AF) and not from the Caatinga because the level of degradation is higher in the AF and there are also many more studies in the AF than in the Caatinga. This map would be of more interest to researchers working on specific biomes. 2)  	We think it would be useful to provide a list with the classification (conservation status predictions) and degree of uncertainty for each species. 3)  	Some tables in the Supplementary Information that are .csv files (e.g. Table S3) are not accessible … or we do not know how to access them. Congratulations to all the authors, this paper is an excellent contribution, providing predictions of conservation status for each species, which can provide a basis from which full Red List assessments can progress more quickly.

I am currently being supervised by Professor Juliane Karine Ishida. Throughout my academic career, I have been studying the interaction between plants and microorganisms, and your preprint titled ""Disease Resistance correlates with Core Microbiome Diversity in Cotton"" caught my attention. Recently, our research group received an invitation to evaluate preprints in order to gain experience and contribute to the advancement of science. Therefore, I have chosen your work for discussion in one of our meetings. In collaboration with other colleagues, we have brought forth some suggestions to assist in improving your article, and we hope they may prove useful to you. We noticed a lack of introductory content in his introduction, which would be essential to better understand his study. (Lines 95-100) - The explanation of cotton leaf roll disease (CLCuD) and its economic implications for the country is provided only at the conclusion of the preprint. We believe these topics could be explored in more depth in your introduction. We also note that the text is not structured into categories such as introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion. We understand that this may be in line with the journal's guidelines. In your methodology section (lines 62 - 68), we missed a more detailed description of your samples. For example, we are curious about the distribution of samples among susceptible, partially tolerant, and fully tolerant varieties. Furthermore, it would be useful to know how many samples are attributed to epiphytic leaves, endophytic leaves, rhizosphere, and endophytic roots. We suggest that compiling this data into a supplementary table could be beneficial. These are some small contributions we offer to help you further improve and refine your work. We hope these suggestions are valuable to you in advancing your research.

I completely agree that we need to sequence more individual mosquitoes, if we ever want to understand the complex relationships between insect-specific viruses, arboviruses and their hosts. However, I have one big remark that I hope you consider to change in the published version of this manuscript. On line 175, you mention 393 mosquito-associated viruses and you define them as the 'core mosquito virome' for the rest of the manuscript. I feel that this term is too broad to describe just all your mosquito-associated viruses (some of them might be found in only one or very few individual mosquitoes). In general, a core microbiome can be defined as a set of taxa that consistently occur within a given habitat type or host (see https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.01066-22 and https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2104429118). Also, Shi et al. (Microbiome, 2019), one of the first papers to describe a core virome in mosquitoes, describes the core mosquito virome as ""a set of viruses found in the majority of individuals in a particular mosquito population"". Could you change the use of this term in your manuscript to avoid confusion for readers and have a consistent use of the term ""core virome"" in future research?

Namely, what is the definition of 'Boy's Love culture', as it pertains to this study? Is it the consumption of all BL media, or only specific genres featuring homosexual couplings? Is it explicit material, or romantic? What medium; film, novel, cartoon, or comic? Furthermore, what is this BL media cocoon? How, in this research, has this been identified? Was this coined for the research alone, or is it an adopted term from a previous research? Perhaps a brief note to the start of this article to explain the terminology being used in this research could provide clarity. Regarding the method used for this research, I am concerned with the lack of information regarding the individuals that participated in this investigation. Firstly, what is the demographic? Young females is a very broad definition that can have a varied definition; do you mean females under the age of 18? Between 18 - 25? I acknowledge that there is mention of participants 'first exposure' to BL content, and the recruitment section does mention the number of participants, but the demographic is still not listed adequately. The context behind this investigation mentions the 'globalised' nature of young females and BL consumption, but the research was conducted within the singular community of Henan University. This causes a direct conflict with the contention of this work (BL media and the social media influence it wields) and the described 'information cocoon', as the participants come from an individual environment and therefore cannot be accurately described as global fans, especially as they are part of the same University community.  These are important disclaimers that should be mentioned a bit more explicitly. There are also studies mentioned within this article that are not cited, such as the 'fMRI study' referenced on the first page. Nor is there a mention on how the research environment was controlled. I must also question the images used for Experiment 1: Image Rating. The direct comparison between the 6 images shows a significant difference in composition that I cannot dismiss as not interfering with the project. The 3 photos listed on the left are all intimate photographs of homosexual couples; shots above their shoulders and close together. However on the right, we have 3 photos of heterosexual couples that have vastly different compositions, with one photograph depicting a couple from afar, with their backs turned and faces concealed. This is a stark difference from the other photographs, and perhaps--if only a selection of 6 photographs from many--these should be reviewed and reselected to better align the compositions.",2023-09-23T00:55:22,disqus_fMyuNqm8rJ,Raven,10.1101/2023.09.18.558088,Neurological Imprints of Boys’ Love Culture: Shaping Sexual Orientation Identity in the Digital Age’s Young females,"Na Ao, Xiaowei Jiang, Yanan Chen, Yingying Chen, Huihui Niu, Shuoyan Hu",2023-09-21

Nevertheless, deviations from this minimal model have been observed over the years[4]. Work from groups including Klinmman[27,28] and Daniel and Danson[21] have exemplified this unexpected, non-Arrhenius behavior of enzymes and have sought to apply models to these observations, including an equilibrium between active and inactive states of the substrate-bound enzyme[21]. Åqvist and colleagues [5] have sought to distinguish between competing models, including the activation heat capacity model from this manuscript, and the equilibrium model. In the literature, there are contradictory reports regarding the role of activation heat capacity [22,8], leaving the debate on the origin of non-linear temperature dependence of activity unresolved. This paper aims to characterize conformational changes during catalysis through the lens of activation heat capacity. The authors used MalL as a model system and conducted kinetics experiments over a range of temperatures to calculate changes in the heat capacity of activation. Using molecular dynamics, the authors simulate a narrowed conformational landscape of a transition state-like MalL in comparison to wild-type. Based on the observed kinetic behavior of MalL across a wide range of temperatures, the authors presented MMRT-2S, a modified version of Macromolecular Rate Theory (MMRT) that accounts for a cooperative transition between the enzyme-substrate conformation and the transition state-like conformation. The major strength of this paper is high quality temperature-dependent kinetic data collected over a range of temperatures typically not explored, which allows us to evaluate complex models to describe unexpected enzymatic behavior. The major confusion we have with this paper is the lack of details needed to aid the reader in interpreting the data: namely not presenting the hydrogen bond measurements and statistics to demonstrate significance, and a lack of controls or citations for kinetic assay assumptions. Overall, this paper presents an intriguing explanation for the role of conformational changes in catalysis to reconcile diverse observations noted in enzyme literature. Major points: Substrate Saturation, Denaturation Controls, and Assay Set-Up According to the methods section, saturating concentrations of p-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside were assayed. It would be helpful if exact concentrations were reported for reproducibility of the work. Furthermore, it is important to mention if Km has been reported at the range of temperatures assayed for this substrate, to confirm saturation. The text mentions that nonlinearity has been reported in this absence of denaturation; this statement could be strengthened if controls or references were included to corroborate this. From the description in the methods section, we believe the enzyme is not incubated at the assay temperature prior to the reaction, so over the course of the limited reaction time (45 seconds) we are unsure if the enzyme has reached a folded/conformational equilibrium. Furthermore, we think it would be informative for readers if the authors include discussion about foldedness being unlikely to be a contributor to changes in kcat. Mutant Structure Rationale The rationale for creating the S536R mutant is unclear to us. Although we agree that “introducing new hydrogen bond networks at the surface of the protein” is one way to perturb conformational dynamics and rates, we are unsure why arginine was selected as the residue for this. We are also unsure why the X-ray structures were determined in the presence of urea. Mutant / TLC Activity The mutant structure shows a distinct ensemble via the PCA projection. It is important to discuss if activity data collected for this mutant should be expectedly different from WT based on the MMRT-2S model. Hydrogen Bond Measurement Given the difference in crystal packing between the wild-type and mutant structures, it is important to identify if any of the hydrogen bonds of interest are proximal to a gained or lost crystal contact between the two structures. Additionally, while truncating the data to a similar resolution will remove high resolution reflections from the mutant structure, the reflections around 2.3Å will likely have higher signal:noise, which complicates analysis. It would be helpful for readers to have more details on the hydrogen bonds mentioned in Figure 5A – for example, by creating a table of the residues involved in each bond and the amount that the bond was shortened. Further interpretation of the shortened hydrogen bonds would also be helpful; for example, we are curious if the authors consider all the shortened hydrogen bonds as equal contributors to the restricted conformational landscape of the TLC, or if there are certain ones that the authors believe are more impactful. Additionally, for those unfamiliar with MD, more commentary on the interplay between structural data and MD simulations would be instructive. For example, are residue motions observed in MD simulations consistent with the hydrogen bonding differences observed in the static structure? ADH Comparison We are unsure if the authors’ claims contrasting MalL and ADH at different temperatures are supported by the data, given that there was no MD performed on ADH. For MalL, we were able to visualize the restricted conformational landscape of the TLC via a combination of MD simulations and structural data. For ADH, only Cp is calculated from kinetics data, and there is no structure or MD data presented. Arguing that there is a more restricted conformational landscape based on Cp alone seems insufficient compared to the amount of work done on MalL. Perhaps citing more previous literature on ADH in detail would be helpful for strengthening the contrast between MalL and ADH. Minor points: Language / Word Choice: Use of word “significant” should be reserved for demonstrated statistical significance Qualifiers like “very” were used frequently and distract from the data and claims in themselves, particularly in section headers i.e., “Very High Resolution Structure...” “Accurate” should be replaced with “precise” when describing collected data, as the data themselves are observations of  ground truth, and the narrow distribution of replicates implies high precision Scope The claim “The importance of activation heat capacity for enzyme kinetics has been the subject of debate recently” is supported by 3 self-references, out of four total. In previous work, the authors identify that MMRT applies to chemically-limited catalysis, which should be mentioned in the discussion regarding the applicability of the model, and cite Kern and Hilser’s works on adenylate kinase as an edge case as in the author’s previous reviews. Figures In general, the addition of more labels/legends on the plots would help with interpretation. Specific examples: Figure 2: labeling the color that corresponds to each mutant Figure 3: labeling deuterated vs protiated Figure 3D: labeling which curves correspond to ∆H and ∆S Figures 4A & 4B: For clarity, the different regions of MalL (lid, active site, loop, etc.) could be labeled here. Furthermore, arrows depicting the motions observed in PCA1 and PCA2 would be informative. Figure 5A: For clarity, the S536R mutation could be labeled here. - Daphne Chen, Duncan Muir, Margaux Pinney, Jaime Fraser",2023-09-22T23:48:41,disqus_beuvAwjXuv,Duncan Muir,10.1101/2023.07.06.548038,Cooperative conformational transitions and the temperature dependence of enzyme catalysis,"Emma J.

These results are thorough, compelling and persuasive. They also stand in contrast with other papers, published in the aftermath of alphafold's release, that argue the opposite.

It is therefore unclear how much of the results should be attributed to the neural network itself and how much should be attributed to the minimization step following structure prediction.

Our original finding that the peptide PEN is an agonist of GPR83 was already verified by two different laboratories (see Foster et al, 2019, “Discovery of Human Signaling Systems: Pairing Peptides to G Protein-Coupled Receptors”, Cell, PMID: 31675498; and Parobchak et al, 2020, “Uterine Gpr83 mRNA is highly expressed during early pregnancy and GPR83 mediates the actions of PEN in endometrial and non-endometrial cells”, FS Science, PMID: 35559741). However, when another laboratory can’t confirm what was published, it is important to consider differences between the studies. With this in mind, there are several issues with the study presented here in the BioRxiv report by Giesecke et al. Additional experiments described below would be very helpful. The HEK293 cell line has been reported to express GPR83 mRNA in many studies listed in GEO Profile, and this is confirmed in the current study (Figure 1A). In the figure showing overexpression of HA-tagged GPR83 in HEK293 cells, the distribution is largely intracellular, maybe ER or Golgi (Figure 1B). Thus, it’s not relevant to consider ‘100-fold’ overexpression based on mRNA, as the amount that is correctly folded and expressed at the cell surface may not be much different than in the native HEK293 cell line. Furthermore, the authors show that PEN peptide does produce a robust increase in phosphoERK in Figure 4A (compare the lanes labeled ‘control’ and ‘PEN’). Furthermore, it looks like the PEN-mediated increase in phosphoERK is several fold higher in GPR83-transfected cells than in control cells (Figure 4A). Although the quantitation panel in Figure 4B doesn’t show an increase, there are very large ‘error bars’ reported to be SD, but for N=2 doesn’t SD really mean the range of duplicates? Also, please show all data points in the bar graph! In any case, it would be nice to see a larger N for these studies. But best of all would be a knock-down of GPR83 in HEK293 cells using siRNA, or a related approach. Another point is that in the PEN-GPR83 peptide-receptor system, signaling assays that are distal to the receptor activity (cAMP, PLC) tend to give variable results – this has been previously noted in our original study (Gomes et al, PMID: 27117253). This also appears to be the case with the TANGO assay where we have recently found that long-term treatment with PEN (16 hrs) causes a desensitization of the receptor leading to a complete loss of signal (our unpublished observations). There are also issues with the concentration dependence, and ‘u-shaped’ curves where high concentrations of PEN fail to produce the effects seen with lower concentrations (PMID: 27117253). The authors should repeat the studies with shorter times and lower concentrations of PEN. The lack of binding with Tyr-PEN seen by Giesecke et al. could be due to the presence of an internal His residue in human PEN (YAADHDVGSELPPEGVLGALLRV). Tyr-PEN  used in our previous studies for iodination was the rat sequence, which does not have a His. Because His residues can be iodinated using the chloramine T procedure used by Giesecke et al, this can potentially affect binding. It would be good to test binding with iodinated rat Tyr-PEN, to avoid the His residue. Also, why the C-term amide group? That’s not part of PEN. For the Ca++ assays, Giesecke et al. used Gα16, but our previous studies used Gα16/i3 (PMID: 27117253). This is not a minor difference. Ideally, Giesecke et al could repeat the experiments with Gα16/i3. Finally, protease inhibitors were used in the binding studies by Giesecke et al, which is good. It is not clear if such inhibitors were used in all other studies with PEN, such as those described in Figure 2 and 3. In the absence of protease inhibitors, PEN could be degraded during the assays and this could have accounted for the negative results.

The resulting confidence interval is of course, massive. It is not surprising that it overlaps with other estimates that essentially also estimate the tMRCA of A and B. I fail to see how this adds anything new or supports any conclusion. Figure 2's use of p-values does not properly account for the extreme sampling bias: sampling intensity around the wildlife stalls was much higher than elsewhere. More sampling leads to better p-values. Tom Wenseleers' analysis here is more proper: https://twitter.com/TWensel... Figure 2 B is particularly vulnerable to this bias, as the sequencing attempts were extremely clustered. Figure 2C seems to have omitted some data points: compare with this from Tom Wenseleers again: https://twitter.com/TWensel... Overall, the data actually points to an area near the market entrance/the toilets/the mah jong rooms, and the ""hot areas"" are not over the wildlife stalls. The sampling bias is also particularly visible in figure 3B, which would seem to show an association of human reads with wildlife stalls, when of course, the presence of humans was fairly uniform throughout the market (likely higher concentrations around the entrance/toilets/bathrooms) Figure 4 is notable because it shows CoVs definitively associated with wildlife had a significantly different distribution than SARS-CoV-2. Either SARS-CoV-2 did not emerge from those wilflife stalls, or too much time had passed to make any conclusions. It also serves as evidence against their argument that SARS-CoV-2 RNA from infected animals would have decayed substantially (as the other CoV RNA apparently had not). Figure 5 is interesting, but it does not establish where any of the animals came from. It simply rules out Vietnam and a Chinese provine north of Hubei. The authors then proceed to engage in pure speculation about the possibility of the Raccoon dogs coming from an area known to have SARS-CoV-2 like viruses. Overall, I see nothing new here, just more analysis of very biased and hopelessly impoverished data",2023-09-19T13:19:44,disqus_25ZToSOvrx,Ema Nymton,10.1101/2023.09.13.557637,Genetic tracing of market wildlife and viruses at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Alexander Crits-Christoph, Joshua I.

The authors present compelling evidence that fine-tuning sequence-based machine learning models (protein language models) on in-house experimental data can accelerate the discovery of high-affinity binders, in this case against CD40. However, the entire manuscript is focused on single-chain nanobodies, not antibodies as the text suggests, and the authors only mention this in second and third paragraphs of Results as well as the caption of Figure 2. This is an extremely important distinction and I think the authors need to revise their language throughout the document to make this clear; i.e., use the term nanobody, not antibody. Nanobodies differ from antibodies in several key respects, such as loop lengths, which are discussed here: doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023..... Relevant to this manuscript is the fact that they comprise a single chain, and are thus amenable to out-of-the-box masked and/or autoregressive protein language models. Standard antibodies consist of two chains; to my knowledge, only one method, which has not been peer reviewed, has been trained on paired antibody sequences: arxiv.org/abs/2308.14300. Thus, several obstacles still exist that prevent the methods described here from being directly translated to standard monoclonal antibodies. The manuscript does not discuss or acknowledge these obstacles.",2023-09-17T06:30:29,diegodelalamo,Diego del Alamo,10.1101/2023.09.13.557505,IMPROVING ANTIBODY AFFINITY USING LABORATORY DATA WITH LANGUAGE MODEL GUIDED DESIGN,"Ben Krause, Subu Subramanian, Tom Yuan, Marisa Yang, Aaron Sato, Nikhil Naik",2023-09-13

The authors write, Prior studies calculated correlations of SARS-CoV-2 detection and animal sequence read abundances in market samples, concluding that SARS-CoV-2 was negatively correlated with mammalian wildlife species (Liu et al. 2023; Bloom 2021). The intended citation is presumably to ( Bloom 2023), not to ( Bloom 2021). 2. The authors claim that ""The start of the COVID-19 pandemic was traced epidemiologically to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market"" (p. 3). This is false or misleading. After the first-detected market-linked cluster was noticed, this led the search for more cases to focus heavily on the market: i.e., that is simply where the local Chinese authorities looked, as they have made clear in repeated statements ( Bahry 2023, Table 1). For instance, the WHO-China joint study emphasizes the ""epidemiology surveillance at several hospitals (close to Huanan market), Huanan market and the neighbourhood of Huanan market"" ( WHO-China 2021, Annex p. 125). Strangely, the authors do not cite these repeated warnings about sampling bias in the early search, by those who did the search. Nor do they cite my critique ( Bahry 2023) of their earlier attempt to control for such bias ( Worobey et al. 2022). 3. Strangely, the authors' heat map in their ""relative risk"" analysis of positivity rate (Fig. 2a) shows very little heat for the highest-positivity-rate stall: a beef stall in the east wing with 1/1 samples positive (cf. Bahry 2023, Fig. 1). Although the authors do not explain this anomaly, it seems to be due to an analytical strategy which downplays less-sampled stalls. Their heat map does not depict stalls' positivity rates: rather it depicts the p-values of stalls' positivity rates. However, smaller samples will automatically have lower p-values for the same positivity rate, due to smaller samples having lower power to detect the same effect size. Thus, rather than showing the spatial distribution of elevated positivity, their heat map more reflects the spatial distribution of sampling effort (heavily concentrated in the southwest wildlife corner). An alternative approach would have been to map relative risk itself, estimated with smoothing by pseudocounts (cf. Bahry 2023, Fig. 1). Estimating positivity as s +0.077/ n +1, for s positives out of n samples, takes into account both the 7.7% positivity base rate, and noise due to uncertainty in less-sampled stalls.",2023-09-17T03:50:07,davidbahry,David Bahry,10.1101/2023.09.13.557637,Genetic tracing of market wildlife and viruses at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Alexander Crits-Christoph, Joshua I.
