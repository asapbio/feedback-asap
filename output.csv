RNA secondary structure concerns would also apply to swapping chunks of unrelated genomes. Appealing to imagined concerns about RNA secondary structure is, however, a good way to ignore synonymous mutations more than one mutation away.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.01.514701v2#comment-6041129458,biorxivstage,2,"From Prof. Leonid Sazanov, IST Austria. This preprint describes the first structures of mitochondrial complex I from Drosophila melanogaster (Dm). The work is done carefully technically and is a valuable addition to the current set of complex I structures from various species, previously lacking representatives from insects or Protostomia clade in general. Complex I from Protostomia, in contrast to that Deuterostomia including mammals, appears to lack so-called “deactive” state, which is important for mechanistic discussion. In this study authors find that apo (i.e. in the absence of any substrates or turnover) Dm complex I (DmCI) can adopt two main conformations, resembling so-called “open” and “closed” states seen previously with other species. Uniquely, one of DmCI states is characterized by the ordered N-terminal helix of the accessory NDUFS4 (18 kDa) subunit, which wedges between the peripheral (PA) and membrane (MA) arms. This was not seen in other structures and appears to be a specific feature of Dm and closely related species. Authors suggest that the helix may temporarily “lock” this DmCI conformation. However, it may instead just reflect the ordering of a particular structural element in one of complex I states, as seen for different parts of complex I in other species. Overall, the new DmCI structures are consistent with our recent mechanistic proposals [1, 2] and complement the emerging picture. However, the discussion of the two states in this work is very confusing in my opinion, which is why I wrote this comment. It is surprising that the DmCI states were labelled as they were (locked open and closed) while it is clear that it should be other way round (locked closed and open). DmCI states were assigned by authors on the basis of PA-MA angle if complex I is viewed sideways, as we did for ovine complex I originally [1, 3]. In what authors called here the closed state this angle is very slightly smaller than in the other state, thus the assignment. However, it is clear from Fig. 4- suppl. 2A and movies that the main difference between the DmCI states is the rotation of PA, not the closing/opening of PA-MA angle. As we noted in our latest paper [2], the PA-MA angle is not a good indication of open or closed state – PA tilts in Ovine but mainly twists/rotates in E. coli. In E. coli the states are related by PA clockwise rotation (when looked from PA tip) when going from closed to open state. In the recent paper on Chaetonium complex I [4] – form 1 is clearly open state, form 2 is clearly closed (in our updated nomenclature as below). They are related by the PA clockwise rotation (when looked from PA tip) going closed-to-open (2-to-1). I.e. it is the same overall change as in E. coli. Therefore open and closed states should be attributed not by PA-MA angle, as we noted [2], but on the basis of: Open state - OPEN Q cavity (mostly disordered key loops, especially ND3) and pi-bulge in ND6 (as well as flipped out into lipid ND1 Y156 in E. coli / Y142 ovine). Closed state – CLOSED Q cavity (mostly ordered key loops, especially ND3), no pi-bulge in ND6 (as well as flipped in into E-channel ND1 Y156 in E. coli / Y142 ovine). So what was called locked open state in DmCI in fact clearly corresponds to closed state in our nomenclature (ND3 loop ordered, no pi-bulge). What was called closed state in DmCI is in fact open state (ND3 loop disordered, pi-bulge present). The only difference with E. coli open state is that NuoC beta1-2 loop is retracted in DmCI but is inserted into Q cavity in E. coli (incidentally, some of labels describing E. coli features are wrong in Fig.5-suppl1BC). However, in Ovine this loop is disordered in open state, so its conformation is not absolutely defined by the state (unlike ND3 loop and pi-bulge). Another difference is that in DmCI open state PSST loop is not flipped as in Ovine. However, in E. coli this loop does not flip either, so again its conformation is not absolutely defined by the state. Considering the re-assignment of states as we suggest then the PA rotation going closed-to-open is in the same direction in DmCI as in E. coli. A similar rotation was also noted in another recent manuscript on DmCI [5]. In summary, after re-assignment it is clear that main features defining closed and open states (in our nomenclature) in DmCI are the same as in Ovine, E. coli and Chaetonium. It is possible that under turnover conditions in Drosophila even more of the features will become consistent (such as NuoC beta1-2 loop insertion in open state), however the assignment is already unambiguous. So to avoid confusing readers about what is open and what is closed state it would be great if authors renamed the classes according to our latest nomenclature as above. One potential question is that in parallel paper [5] (otherwise mostly consistent with this study) in Dm2 state (open state in our nomenclature) ND3 loop apparently remains ordered. However, Agip et al. did only global 3D classification on the entire complex I molecule which, according to our experience, is unlikely to fully separate classes - then any Dm1 (closed) state particles still present in Dm2 class would easily show ND3 loop density – we have seen this a lot when classification in not converged. Additionally, the resolution of Dm2 class is quite low. Considering authors comment here on the poor density of some regions in our Ovine deactive structures, I need to note that these data were post-processed with high B-factor suitable for the main bulk density. ND5-HL, TMH16ND5, NDUFA11 are indeed not well defined but are still present as we can re-activate this prep. However, if one applies blurring B-factor of about 100 in COOT (or filter maps to about 4A) to the deposited densities of deactive states, then except for open1, all other states (especially open3 and open4) show very clearly relocated ND6 TM4 density together with loop blocking PA/MA movements. It is clear that after full deactivation ND5-HL, TMH16ND5, NDUFA11 become flexible but still associated with complex, while ND6 TM4 together with its loop relocates. Authors also mention in discussion that in Yarrowia both open and closed states were observed. However, as we discussed in the SI of our paper [2], only one conformational state was observed under turnover conditions in Yarrowia. It resembles the open state of Ovine CI – pi-bulge present, ND3 loop disordered, etc. The reported conformational changes in Yarrowia CI [6] may in fact reflect the deactive to open state transition, and the closed state remains to be properly classified out. It is also a bit strange for authors to criticize our E. coli paper [2] on the basis on Kolata/Efremov paper [7] – we have clearly shown that the resting E. coli state is promoted by DDM detergent (which was used in [7]) and this is why we took a lot of care to fully purify enzyme in milder LMNG detergent, with clear data showing it is stable in LMNG. Further, air-to-water interface argument from authors is not applicable to our data – grids were made with continuous carbon layer support, so protein is never exposed to air during blotting/freezing. Authors also state that “thermophilic yeast Chaetonium thermophilum CI, which is found in multiple resting states, none of which corresponding to the open state seen in other species” [4] However, Chaetonium two states correspond very closely to Ovine open and closed states, as authors themselves state in [4]. So the point of the statement above is not clear. It seems like in the discussion the authors try hard to suggest alternatives to our mechanism, even though there are no real factual arguments here. One particular argument is that open states of complex I could be all deactive (as still suggested for mammals [5]) and do not participate in the catalytic cycle, with only closed state being part of catalytic cycle. However, all the new emerging data from species which do not have deactive state, i.e. E. coli [2], Chaetonium [4] and even including current Drosophila structures point out that closed-to-open transitions as part of catalytic cycle are universal. Overall, I hope that the discrepancies above will be corrected in the final paper. References 1.    Kampjut, D. and L.A. Sazanov, The coupling mechanism of mammalian respiratory complex I.

It is a comprehensive and very data-rich study you have performed, and definitely a valuable dataset for the community when data are all published. We have been discussing the preprint in the lab, and were very intrigued about your conclusion that S. cerevisiae runs aerobic glycolysis as means of being primed for anaerobic growth. We recently have explored growth strategies of another Crabtree-positive yeast, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and I believe its physiology serves as a counterargument to your conclusion. Wild-type S. pombe anaerobically halts growth almost completely (e.g. Heslot 1970 J Bacteriol), and/or induce sexual development, a signature of severe stress. Aerobically, it has a clear disadvantage over S. cerevisiae: S. pombe grows ~25% slower in aerobic batch cultures than S.c. (specific growth rate of 0.3/h vs 0.4/h in S.c.) with a high specific fermentation flux (RQ of ~6), and switches to respirofermentation in glucose-limited chemostats earlier than S.c. (mu_crit/mu_max 0.53 vs 0.7 in WT S.c.). This is all even despite the fact S.p. has a higher P/O ratio (1.28 vs 1.0 in S.c.). So if intense fermentation is adaptation for anaerobic growth, why doesn't S. pombe go fully respiratory to outcompete other bugs in aerobic environments? I would be delighted if you could comment more on this. Thanks in advance!

However, this is not entirely correct. In the NTSR1-H4bmX:SR48692 complex, M250 points towards, not away from, the TM bundle. - In Figures 3F and S8G,H, F347(7.31) is labeled incorrectly and should be F346(7.30). Y346(7.30) is also labeled incorrectly and should be Y347(7.31). - It is stated that “Addition of NT8-13 or SR142948A induces sizeable upfield chemical shift perturbations (Figure 3A).” However, the next sentence states that the peaks are approximately aligned, which I don’t understand: “The positions of the M2044.60 peak in the apo, NT8-13 and SR142948A bound forms are approximately aligned, despite the different nature of the ligands”. Do you actually mean the position of the M204 side chain in the crystal structures? - It is also stated: “Thus, it suggests the main effect of the ligands on M204(4.60) chemical shifts is through the modulation of the contacts with other receptor residues, rather than the direct effect of the ligand on the methionine methyl group.” Don’t you think the ligands could indeed have a strong direct effect? The apo pocket is obviously empty, whereas in the NT8-13 and SR14 complexes, M204 is rather close to the isobutyl and adamantyl moieties of the ligands, respectively.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.18.512756v1#comment-6035707945,biorxivstage,3,"Dear Alex Crits-Christoph, Thanks for taking a look into our preprint. Let me share a few thoughts regarding the points you raised: 1) you argue that the presence of similar sites in related viruses is an indication for recombination/natural origin, which speaks against bioengineering. This is wrong: 1a) even if you had only one viral genome, such as Banal-20-52, 3 of the 5 sites would be modified by a bioengineer in exactly the way observed in SC2, see Table S3. There are just not that many options to introduce/remove these sites with only synonymous wobble mutations. Of note, the other 2 sites (3rd BsmBI site and 1st BsaI site) are present in RaTG13, which was most likely sequenced in 2018 https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv... and certainly known to WIV researchers. 1b) as we describe in the preprint, researchers have aligned restriction sites in different reverse genetics systems (Becker et al 2008). The WIV was in possession of thousands of viral samples in 2019 according to Daszak. Access to the respective viral genome databases was not even granted to the WHO commission (indicating there was something to hide). The fact that this commission was led by the most conflicted person in the world is also something I haven't seen in any other field, at least not in the last 100 years. 1c) A bioengineer would manipulate a site using mutations functional in other genomes to reduce the risk of disturbing secondary RNA structures. 2) You argue that a predicted common ancestor such as recCA, in which some of these sites are also present, does indicate they originated from recombination. Let’s be clear, we should have discussed recombination as a potential source altered RS in our preprint. And we should have discussed RpYN06. I had missed that Zhihua had pointed out that neighboring regions independently indicate a recombination, as this was posted in a very long thread listing lots of examples of sites being present in related viruses, which by itself is irrelevant, as discussed in 1. It was an honest mistake. RpYN06 was also not discussed in that recCA graph. However, your argument about recCA is wrong. 2a) If an ancestor is predicted based on SC2, we have a circular argument as pointed out by Prof. Bloom. A segment of this ancestor could be predicted completely based on SC2. Thus, if an engineer would introduce a protein sequence such as “THISISSYNTHETIC”, it could appeare just like that in the predicted ancestor. In fact, introducing alterations would make a section more unique and increase the likelihood that this section will be found in the ancestor. 3) J. Pekar predicted a common ancestor excluding SC2. This is a good counterargument, in fact the probably the only valid one. Still, it does not withstand scientific review. 3a) The problem is that if we consider a lab leak could have occured, we have to consider that related genomes published by Chinese researchers after the outbrake could be manipulated, which is easy to do. I started looking into the raw reads, publication history and sequences of some of these genomes, including RaTG13, RpYN06, RmYN02 and talked to field experts. Many clear indications of manipulation in these genomes arose: - missing bacterial reads https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv... - lots of reads of laboratory vectors in RpYN06 - too few bat reads in RaTG13 and RpYN06 - abnormal rRNA 3’-ETS reads in RpYN06 and RmYN02 - RaTG13 was initially not linked to Ra4991 - more than 60 (!!!) consecutive nonsynonymous mutations in the S2 of RaTG13 - frequently altered datasets https://usrtk.org/covid-19-... - numerous other anomalies inconsistent with fecal samples https://vixra.org/pdf/2010.... https://www.preprints.org/m... https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go... Looks like we both failed to do our homework here, me in the last weeks, you and your colleagues in the last years. The fact that RaTG13 contains 60 consecutive nonsynonymous in S2 is by itself inconsistent with expectations from natural evolution. So we will either exclude these highly problematic genomes or keep them in a separate analysis, clearly indicating these issues. You and your colleagues should do the same in affected publications IMO. But let’s pretend these issues would not exist, or that one can find some reasonable explanation for these anomalies. Let’s look at the BsmBI site at 22926 in RaTG13. It’s CGTCTC sequence codes for RL. In SC2 Hu1 the same RL is coded for by AGATTG. There are 4 (!!!) synonymous mutations in these 6 nucleotides. I could not find anything like this RaTG13 in related genomes. So the entire recombination argument is only valid if you, at the same time, say RaTG13 and the other genomes are not manipulated and can predict a valid ancestor and ignore that random mutation or recombinations cannot explain where these sites in RaTG13 came from. The significantly higher rate of silent mutations within BsaI/BsmBI recognition sites comparing SC2 and is independent of potential recombination events leading to these sites in SC2. Both a manipulated RaTG13 genome or manipulated BsaI/BsmBI sites in SC2 lead to the same conclusion, a synthetic origin. 4 J. Pekar stated it would be expected to get one last mutation not explainable by recombination. This is wrong. 4a) Is would be very unusual to get the last dS mutation at exactly the needed position. Let’s say only 1 dS can complete an ”almost” complete BsaI site. There will be 5x6-1 positions were a mutation could destroy a rev. gen. system. Even if only 15 of these 29 positions are dS and not selected against, in each of these sites 2-3 dS mutations could be possible, which gives you only a ~2-3% chance that this last mutation will complete a rev. gen. system rather than destroying it. 5 Another point raised was that we cherry-picked BsaI and BsmBI. This is wrong. -> This combination is often used to generate SC2 infectious clones. It was used by the WIV for spike substitutions before. And any bioengineer would immediately see that using these sites in a Banal-like ancestor requires very few modifications, which is always preferred. Still, we did run simulations for equally efficient endonucleases, it didn’t change much. By the way, did you talk to any bioengineer before suggesting we should withdraw this bioengineering preprint? I got the impression none of the scientists linked in your post have substantial experience in designing parallel screening assays as implied in Fig 1 and as one would need to do the work proposed in the DEFUSE proposal. Also, a protein alignment of RaTG13 and SC2 also strongly indicates micromanipulations in the RBM and FCS, exactly as proposed in the DEFUSE proposal. So does further evidence: This paper: https://assets.researchsqua... indicates that bat-SL-CoVZC45/ a synthetic variant was generated exactly as our preprint suggests for SC2 using pUC57 (!!!) plasmids. This preprint: https://www.researchsquare.... indicates a direct ancestor of all human SC2 lines was cultured on Vero or CHO cells. Vero are mentioned in the DEFUSE proposal. CHO are used to test hACE2 binding, as mentioned in the DEFUSE proposal (see e.g. PMC7095783 or hACE2 expressing CHO). Deep sequencing was done by a company called Sangon, which is also mentioned in the DEFUSE proposal. Then there is the human-identical FCS found in SC2. Hundreds of possible combinations could lead to a functional FCSs. SC2 contains a human-identical one, exactly as suggested in the DEFUSE proposal, and one described in the University of Ralph Baric, one of the DEFUSE applicants https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... Regarding Kristian Andersen’s and Stuart Neil’s tweets: they had both blocked me before criticizing our work. Seriously, what is going on here… Just in case they did post anything of relevance, let me know. I admit that we have to better explain what was actually planned according to the DEFUSE proposal and what features one would need in a viral reverse genetics systems compatible with library screenings. Apparently adding a drawing showing ROI manipulations in Fig 1 was insufficient for many virologists, who complained that one could construct such reverse genetics systems using seamless cloning. I talked to many bioengineers who did not have any issues here. Again, I appreciate any valid critics on these comments, with best regards, Valentin Bruttel",2022-11-09T15:37:59,zukunft2go,zukunft2go,10.1101/2022.10.18.512756,Endonuclease fingerprint indicates a synthetic origin of SARS-CoV-2,"Valentin Bruttel, Alex Washburne, Antonius VanDongen",2022-10-20

Future studies can benefit from the dataset provided, which can serve as a valuable resource. An intriguing finding was the substantial similarity between xenografted microglia and ex vivo human microglia subsets, emphasizing the importance of environment on microglial profiles. We believe that a few experimental and analysis additions or discussion points would further enhance the overall impact of this study. Following are a few thoughts from our group: 1. Although we understand that using a ""proteomic ruler"" may not always be suitable, using both copy numbers and concentration may complicate the interpretation of results. For example, could differences in total protein content also explain the differences in proteins associated with glycolysis, mitochondria, ribosomes, and the nuclear envelope (Fig 1e)? 2. Would using mouse stem cell-derived microglia or primary mouse microglia cultured in vitro upon isolation be a more relevant in vitro mouse microglia model, as opposed to the BV2 mouse line? 3.Did the analysis of the proteins identified in only one subset reveal any distinct signatures? 4.We believe additional details would benefit the Methods section of the manuscript. Among these are (a) sharing age and gender data concerning the patients included in the human ex vivo subset and (b) showing the gating strategy for pure microglia isolation (in ex vivo and xenografted subsets). 5. Moreover, we were a bit confused by the fact that the ex vivo and xenotransplanted mice were not the same age (3.5 months vs. 2.5 months old, respectively). 6. Similarly, it is challenging to compare xenografted microglia with ESC-derived microglia since they are at different stages of maturation (10 weeks vs. 1 week, respectively). 7.

Since the results are largely based on antibodies that are specific to each NPR1, NPR2 and NPR3, and since these three proteins have some sequence homology, then some additional information on the antibodies may be needed to robustly confirm this intriguing conclusion. Are the NPR antibodies monoclonal, and what region of each protein is recognized? What would also help would be to show the full lane for each blot, ideally including size markers. The anti-NPR3 blots appear to cut off where the anti-NPR1 signal runs, and vice-versa. Each antibody could be validated for recognition of its specific target, and lack of recognition of the other two homologous targets. The validations are needed only for whichever of the three methods (western, immunoprecipitation, or immunohistochemistry) was used for that antibody. It would also help to explain if the p62 protein is a receptor protein and to confirm that p62 is in the cell membrane fraction, like NPR1, NPR2 and NPR3. Also, the dimer is one possible form of the NPR enzymes. The few studies that have been done with purified, active mammalian NPR have identified a tetramer for NPR1 (PMID: 1657900 & 35821229).

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.165217v2#comment-6033622699,biorxivstage,0,"Erin Schuman Jan 7, 2021 While initial reports argued that emetine was required to stabilize the interaction of puromycylated peptides with ribosomes, some recent studies of local protein synthesis via the puromycylation method relied on treatment with puromycin alone for ~5–10 min, with the implication that detected nascent proteins do not appreciably diffuse away from their site of synthesis (i.e. ribosome) within the treatment time (Colombo et al., 1965; tom Dieck et al., 2015; Morisaki et al., 2016). To determine how far a nascent protein might diffuse on these timescales (i.e. the spatial resolution of the method), we calculated the expected displacement as a function of time, based on the previously measured diffusion coefficient of GFP in the cytosol (Di Rienzo et al., 2014; Figure 5). This calculation depends on the dimensionality of space in which the molecule is confined. However, even in the most limiting case of one-dimensional diffusion—approximating movement along a very narrow neural projection—a protein is expected to diffuse ~100 µm in less than 1 min. This distance is large compared to both the scale of the relevant structures to which protein synthesis was localized in neurons (tens of microns) (tom Dieck et al., 2015; Biever et al., 2020), and to the diameter of HeLa cells (~20 microns) (Borle, 1969), in which the method was demonstrated (David et al., 2012). Thus, limiting puromycin treatment time to a few minutes does not ensure that nascent proteins remain confined to the subcellular region in which they are synthesized. More Using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) diffusion in CHO cells as a model for endogenous protein diffusion is not the most appropriate. In non-native cells, the diffusion of GFP is influenced by molecular crowding of its environment, as it likely does not have any abundant endogenous protein interaction partners (e.g. aequorin). For example, the GFP diffusion value cited by Enam et al. in Figure 5, (dark green line in our linked Figure), derived from studies in CHO cells, is much faster than the GFP diffusion values obtained in neuronal compartments like axons (light green line in Figure) (Reshetniak et al., 2020). In fact, and even better, there are direct data available on the diffusion of puromycylated peptides in a neuron-derived cell line (Ge et al., 2016) (purple line in Figure). The diffusion of puromycylated peptides measured directly in Ge et al., is ~ 10-fold slower than the diffusion of cytosolic GFP in CHO cells shown in Figure 5 of Enam et al. In addition, many groups have directly studied the diffusion of neuronal proteins in mature neurons- and again found diffusion values that are much slower than cytosolic GFP in the same subcellular compartment (grey line in Figure). As such, we believe that puromycin, when used appropriately, can be used in neurons to ascertain or validate the location of nascent proteins in or near the compartment (axonal or dendritic) in which they were synthesized. Practically speaking, measurements should be made in distal processes (e.g. > 50 microns from the cell body) following short-labelling times (~ 5 min) using a low (~2 – 5 uM) puromycin concentration– these are the typical parameters used by most experimenters, including our group. link to Figure: https://schumanlab.github.i...

Towards the end of the first trimester it is expressed in dorsal root ganglia, cranial nerves/ganglia, and auditory, pituitary, and nasal tissues as well as in the neural retina."" The involvement of some of the transcription factors of interest in the present work (SOX10, FOXD3, CHD7), were also established in human neural crest and other embryonic tissues in this early transcriptomics paper back in 2008 (Hum Mol Genet. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddn235): ""We finally examined the spatial expression of a selection of genes identified by SAGE using in situ hybridization on human embryo sections at C13 (Fig. 4).

(1) Unfortunately JunctionSeq is not available in the current Bioconductor release (it appears to not be actively supported), so it would be difficult for me to implement any options to adapt it into the SpliceWiz pipeline (due to compatibility issues, etc). Nevertheless, as I understand, JunctionSeq utilises both exon and junction reads which is a different philosophy than that of SpliceWiz which only uses junctions (except in IR). One issue with STAR's SJ.out.tab is that when read pairs overlap a region that contains a splice junction, that junction is counted twice! In SpliceWiz, read pairs are treated as fragments and so coverage is not double-counted. This is also another feature in our coverage plots: unlike IGV, coverage from overlapping read pairs are not counted twice. Conceptually, read-pairs arise from the same RNA molecule, so the coverage and junction counts should not be counted twice. I'm not familiar with QoRTs and whether or not it suffers from the same issue. SpliceWiz treats included and excluded reads as separate matrices, and GLM-based contrasts in DESeq and limma wrappers evaluate the interaction between these matrices and the contrasting variable as their readouts. A helpful explanation of this approach by the DESeq2 author can be found here: http://rstudio-pubs-static.... In the end, users would choose a tool based on a number of factors - ease of use, ease of experimental validation of the detected signals, ease of user understanding of how the data is wrangled. SpliceWiz offers a simplistic view of splicing using the traditional concept of it being a binary event (e.g. skipped vs included cassette exons, etc), which is (hopefully) easy to understand for researchers. This may well be at the expense of detecting complex (more-than-one-step) splicing events which is one limitation. (2) Although our group's prior contribution (IRFinder) assesses""all"" introns as putative IR events (a good assumption at the time as IR was relatively unknown back then), SpliceWiz makes the distinction of annotated vs unannotated IR in that annotated IR means a transcript from the GTF contains an exon that fully overlaps an intron in another transcript. This is useful for the purposes of benchmarking using simulators like flux-simulator, where our input is transcript_id and TPM values (meaning it can't simulate IR events if the IR-transcript is not already annotated). We discovered our annotation approach discovered 3x more annotated IR events than rMATS and SUPPA2, and Figure S4 essentially explains why. We don't believe these extra annotated events affects false positive rates (I agree it would be useful to formally test this!). The reason is the general principle of assessing ASEs as""local"" events - which is based on the assumption the event occurs independently of other ASEs outside the locus. Whether the other end(s) of the exons of the IR event is differentially spliced should not be relevant to the IR at the intron of interest.

Regarding polygenes, they cite a 1992 paper of Naveira (2), rather than his 1998 summary of work carried out with Maside (3). They appreciate my drawing this to their attention and have suggested that readers of their preprint paper would appreciate a formal comment. At issue is whether, when genomically dispersed, the term “polygenes” should be interpreted as “many genes,” or something else. Pondering why incompatibility factors are so dispersed they write (1): “One of our key findings is that many factors of perhaps individually small effects are widely dispersed across autosomes or on the Z chromosome. Consequently, average chromosomal ancestry is often more informative of phenotypes than any particular locus. This pattern is similar to the polygenic threshold model of hybrid incompatibility in Drosophila, where abnormal phenotypes depend more on the total quantity of introgression than where introgression occurs in the genome [41, 42, 43].” Their first reference here “[41]” is to Naveira’s 1992 report on polygenic effects causing sterility in male fruit fly hybrids. However, they do not mention his subsequent detailed studies with Maside that were summarized in 1998 (3). These concluded that, rather than genes per se, “it might be only a question of foreign DNA amount.” Thus, “experiments on the nature of these polygenes suggest that the coding potential of their DNA may be irrelevant.” The Naviera-Maside hypothesis was cited in a 2000 paper on Haldane's rule (4), but it has been largely overlooked in the literature. There appears to be no discussion of the hypothesis in the paper of Xiong et al. (1), even though the case for it has grown appreciably (5). It is also important in view of their paper's opening remarks on ""the sex with the greatest fitness costs."" Fitness usually implies genes. However, sterility and fitness do not necessarily go together. A mule is sterile but very fit. So being ""fit"" is subtle and it may be unwise to imply that a sterile organism is necessarily unfit, especially when that sterility is considered ""largely phenomenological."" Thus, it is good that Xiong et al. write of ""incompatability factors"" rather than of ""incompatability genes"" (1), which implies phenotypes.

When the changes were evaluated in our tumor samples it appears that multiple changes resulted from incorrect mapping of the sequence reads. For example, the PHF2 variants, which occurred at the first 2 bases of intron 16, corresponded to the first 2 bases of exon 17. These are visible in IGV when soft clipping is turned off, and the first 5 bases that were proposed to be intronic also matched the first 5 bases of exon 17, which is indicative of the problem of mapping RNA-seq reads properly. This was not true of all of the changes, as the G>A changes in NEIL1 mapped to exonic sequences, but we also have transcriptome data from matched normal tissue samples from 1 of our patients where expression of these variants was observed. This is another issue that has not to my knowledge been adequately addressed, as normal tissues express ADAR, indicating that these changes may not be tumor-specific. Finally, there is the issue of the high error rate of reverse transcription, which may not occur equally at all sites. This is a problem that is not easy to resolve, unless these changes are directly probed, which would seem like a good way of potentially validating these changes.",2022-11-02T18:28:17,disqus_1ruehpT9ca,Paul Robbins,10.1101/2022.09.17.508207,Proteogenomic analysis reveals RNA as an important source for tumor-agnostic neoantigen identification correlating with T-cell infiltration,"Celina Tretter, Niklas de Andrade Krätzig, Matteo Pecoraro, Sebastian Lange, Philipp Seifert, Clara von Frankenberg, Johannes Untch, Florian S Dreyer, Eva Bräunlein, Mathias Wilhelm, Daniel P Zolg, Thomas Engleitner, Sebastian Uhrig, Melanie Boxberg, Katja Steiger, Julia Slotta-Huspenina, Sebastian Ochsenreither, Nikolas von Bubnoff, Sebastian Bauer, Melanie Boerries, Philipp J Jost, Kristina Schenck, Iska Dresing, Florian Bassermann, Helmut Friess, Daniel Reim, Konrad Grützmann, Katrin Pfütze, Barbara Klink, Evelin Schrock, Bernhard Haller, Bernhard Kuster, Matthias Mann, Wilko Weichert, Stefan Fröhling, Roland Rad, Michael Hiltensperger, Angela M Krackhardt",2022-09-18

Rajpar et al. bioRxiv 2022 doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.05.... We reviewed this preprint as a part of Arcadia Science's preprint review initiative. Collated comments follow: In this preprint, Rajpar et al. identify a novel role for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in mechanical load-induced bone accrual. The authors conditionally deleted TLR4 from Ocn-Cre-expressing cells (which primarily target mature osteoblasts and osteocytes). Ocn-conditional TLR4 deletion had negligible effect on baseline bone phenotype, but abrogated the effects of ulnar loading on periosteal and endosteal bone formation in both male and female mice. Prior papers from the lab demonstrated that nerve growth factor (NGF) expression by periosteal cells is upregulated by loading. Here, they show that periosteal NGF expression in loaded bones is reduced by the NF-kB inhibitor, BAY 11-7082, and that loading increases the number of TLR4+ periosteal cells in WT mice. Complementary in vitro experiments in MC3T3 cells and primary osteoblasts, showed that both NFkB and TLR4 inhibition abrogated the increase in NGF expression induced by in vitro mechanical stimulation (by fluid shear stress). Finally, the authors use bulk RNA seq to compare the transcriptomic profiles of loaded or non-loaded limbs in TLR4 knockouts and wildtype mice. Overall, these new data are exciting and implicate a novel role for a classic inflammatory signaling cascade in bone mechanoadaptation. However, we found that the structure of the paper, written with NGF as the starting point, is challenging to follow for naïve readers unfamiliar with the prior NGF studies and obscures the key finding (viz., TLR4). The authors could adapt the flow described above to make it an easier read and to emphasize the novelty and impact. Several experiments in the paper feature insufficient sample size or missing data, whose addition would improve the strength of the conclusions that can be made. Specific comments: 1.	Immunostaining in Fig 1 shows NGF:eGFP expression in the periosteum. This is qualitative; it would be better to quantify the number of eGFP+ cells and show this as a percentage of the total number of cells in the region of interest, for both loaded and non-loaded bones. While built on prior results, display and quantification of both loaded and non-loaded bones is important to demonstration the extent to which the BAY inhibitor reduces NGF expression to non-loaded baseline levels. 2.	The qPCR data in Fig 1 C-F are not adequately powered. A minimum of 3 mice per treatment group must be analyzed for statistical analysis. 3.	It is not clear how the ∆∆Ct values in Fig. 1 C-F are normalized. This information appears to be missing. 4.	An explanation of the kinetics of NGF and TRL4 analysis would help. NGF-EGFP expression is analyzed 3 hours post loading and TLR4 positivity is analyzed at 7 days. 5.	Figure 2 is presented as relative values, and non-loaded images are not shown. It took us a while to understand this figure. It would be clearer and more rigorous to show all four groups – Non-loaded WT, Loaded WT, Non-loaded cKO and loaded cKO on the same graph, along with corresponding representative images. These data are included in table 2, but tables are always harder to interpret compared to the main figure. Statistical comparison using repeated measures ANOVA would preserve matching and account for animal-animal variability. 6.	Scale bars are missing on the images in Fig 2. 7.	Figure 3 provides important support for the TLR4-NGF connection, especially with TAK-242 inhibition. The use of two orthogonal NFkB inhibitors to show the same effect is robust. Adding figure labels or illustrations to clarify the cell types used in each panel will add clarity. 8.	The timeline is missing from Fig 3A. 9.	The sample size for experiments in Fig 3 is unclear. Showing individual data points for independent samples, including for controls, is important. 10.	Addition of a diagram/illustration to Figure 3 to indicate the fluid shear stress conditions would add clarity. “Load” should be changed to FSS (Fluid Shear Stress) in this figure. 11.	The RNA-seq analysis in Figures 4, 5, 6 is unclear and does not show the comparisons most relevant to the study. We recommend re-analysis using the following comparisons: A.	Effect of load: Loaded WT vs Non-loaded WT. Which pathways are regulated by loading? B.	Effect of TLR4-cKO on pathways identified in (A) as load-induced pathways: Loaded WT vs Loaded cKO. Are the same pathways that were up/down due to loading still up/down after the KO? C.	NGF-signaling: the in vitro data show NGF expression is abrogated by TLR4 inhibition. But in the RNA-seq data, NGF remains significantly upregulated by loading in cKO mice. Whether this upregulation in the knockouts is due to the heterogeneity of the lysed cells in the tissue or is actually relatively lower than the upregulation of NGF by loading in WT mice is not shown. Comparison of the effect of loading on NGF induction in WT and cKO mice could answer this. If NGF signaling is reduced in cKO mice, compared to WT, RNA-seq would be the ideal method to look for signatures of altered signaling downstream of NGF.

Although tobacco smoking is a prevalent problem, not much research dives into how it affects human physiology on a cellular level. I appreciate your efforts to explore this topic on a deeper level. The title of the paper and objectives of the study stated in the paper claim to explore the effects of cigarette smoke on neurodegeneration and reactive oxygen species, however, there is a less definite link between these topics and inflammatory markers. These topics are not fully explored in this paper. More specifically, reactive oxygen species are not explored to the depths in which EVs were explored, yet it was stated in the paper, “cigarette smoke induces a series of mechanisms that activate cell populations from both the innate and the adaptive immunity, which in turn promote the secretion of multiple inflammation-related molecules such as proinflammatory cytokines including chemokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and extracellular vesicles...” Reactive oxygen species were not explored sufficiently to claim that cigarette smoke can activate ROS. The lack of exploration of key topics mentioned in the beginning of the paper, make the overall study over-promising in combination with a lack of data to back up the paper’s claims. For future studies, it would be helpful to see how ROS is affected in EV-secreting cells post smoking a cigarette to have a better understanding of cigarette smoke on ROS. The data that is available in this paper seems to be more descriptive than quantitative and has difficulty showing significance to claims that are being made. There is also a lack of controls in your data which make the existing data and claims unreliable. Perhaps in Figure 1 and 2, it would have been helpful to take blood from the smokers after smoking to compare the data and ensure what you are seeing is significant. In addition some of the claims that are in this paper are very generalized. It is important to understand how different demographics are impacted by cigarette smoke physiologically. Might I suggest, for a future direction, conducting more testing data to see if there are any statistically significant differences in physiological response for individuals of different  demographics. (For example, age, BMI, gender, ethnicity/cultural background, diabetic/non diabetic, etc. Once again, thank you for posting this paper.

Through examples they show that the distribution of points in this representation correlates with resolution and data collection temperature of the structures. They also construct the RoPE space of a protein using time-resolved experiment datasets and show that minor changes in the linear coordinate space are clearly observed in the RoPE space. This work demonstrates the utility of a non-linear representation of the conformational space in visualizing changes throughout the structure which are originally considered subtle. This work is very interesting and can have significant impact on ensemble studies on protein structures and in crystallization/cryo-EM and fragment screening efforts by showing the impact of temperature and resolution. The manuscript is very concise (perhaps too concise?) and well written. Major points: 1. In Page 3, para 2, the author states differences associated with data collection temperature is preserved across space groups for trypsin and lysozyme but Figure 1(a) and 1(b) marks different space groups only for lysozyme and not for trypsin 2.The section on carboxymyoglobin has some unclear statements: (a) “The RoPE space of these structures showed that, over the first three picoseconds, two torsion angle modes are sufficient to represent a clear trajectory during release of carbon monoxide”. Fig 1(e) does show a trajectory from -0.1ps to 3.0 ps but it is not clear how two torsion modes are sufficient to build the trajectory. (b)“The last three timepoints, 10 ps, 50 ps and 150 ps, are therefore beyond the biologically relevant timescales for CO dissociation in myoglobin and in-line with this, they did not strongly correlate with any other timepoints in RoPE space”. We are confused about which figure/data supports this non-correlation. Is it to be interpreted from Fig 1(e)? If yes, then the author should describe what is correlation and non-correlation in the context of this figure. (c) The section on “mapping motion back onto structure” in the methods makes it unclear why the scaling is normalized to 1degree and how that might bias the magnitude of motion observed in Figure 2a (+/- 0.3 A) 3. We tried running some analysis on the RoPE website but it was either unclear how to go about submitting a job or the website became unresponsive after clicking on “view conformational space”. The author can provide a run-through of the website usage with some examples. 4. It is unclear how important the vagabond refinement performed here is in the clustering. How would figure 1a, b look, for example, if the PDB or PDB-REDO models were subjected to ROPE without further refinement? 5. At the end of the SVD, it should be possible to project the contributions for each SV back onto the torsion angles most responsible for the differences. It would be interesting to plot that for BPTI and lysozyme to identify the torsions/areas leading to the greatest differences across temperatures. Minor points: 1. There are some gray colored points in Figure 1(a) and 1(b) which are not accompanied by a legend and their significance not explained. 2. To highlight the advantage of RoPE space, the author can show clustering of the same protein chains when clustered based on RMSD. The crowding of points when using RMSD vs. the separation of points when using torsion angles can make the utility of RoPE space obvious to the reader. - Ashraya Ravikumar and James Fraser, UCSF",2022-10-31T05:04:22,,Ashraya Ravikumar,10.1101/2022.08.04.502807,Torsion angles to map and visualize the conformational space of a protein,Helen Mary Ginn,2022-08-05
