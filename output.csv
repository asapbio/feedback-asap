These findings could be extremely valuable for identifying preventive measures for mitigating disease transmission, and I thought the experimental question addressed by your paper and the experimental design –incorporating a PSV entry assay and a syncytia formation assay– was cohesive. However, when reading and presenting at a journal club, some questions and comments came up that I would like to share with you. First off, I would like to point out a few simple fixes that I found. For one, Figure 4 is titled “Effect of turmeric extract and curcumin on PSV entry in 293/ACE2 cells,” however, the experimental results exhibited in Figure 4 only deal with curcumin, so I feel renaming that figure would be more accurate. Additionally, I’m curious as to why in Figure 4b, the PSV entry assay treatment conditions included the following: non-treated 30 mins/SARS-CoV-2 16-18h curcumin 30 mins/SARS-CoV-2 16-18h curcumin 30 mins/SARS-CoV-2+curcumin 16-18h but did not account for the effect of non-treated 30 mins/SARS-CoV-2+curcumin 16-18h? I was curious as to the logic for excluding that particular treatment combination, which I feel could’ve been a good control for comparing the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-2/curcumin without the additional variable/impact of the initial 30 min treatment. As a side note, it might be beneficial to readers to make more clear, what is meant by “curcumin pre-treatment”; does that refer to the 30 min “black arrow” segment, or the 16-18h “gray arrow” segment in which the virus has a “+ curcumin” label? One final thing I want to point out is the use of statistics in this paper. You state that a t-test is used throughout, however, I believe that an ANOVA might be more effective here, not only to reduce the number of tests you have to run on the data (and therefore reduce the risk of making a Type I error), but also so that you can show the readers comparisons between each and every group, and not just between each individual group and the control. Additionally, it would be helpful if there were asterisks or “n.s.” consistently shown for every statistic (for example, this is done on Figure 5b, but not Figure 4d), along with a key on every graph indicating the significance levels indicated by each asterisk, to help clear up some confusion about interpreting significance and statistics. Going back to the Figure 4 example, in the paper, it is stated that, “The results indicated that curcumin reduced PSV entry, especially for curcumin pretreatment before the addition of PSV (P = 0.035)” in reference to Figure 4d; however, in the actual graph, there isn’t sufficient statistical representation to confirm this conclusion (no statistics are shown for comparing Cur 1uM and the control) and additionally, I had a hard time determining what defined the pre-treatment when flipping between Figures 4b and 4d. Ultimately, I feel the paper is a great start and could mainly benefit from a few changes to encourage more clarity surrounding the ways in which different treatments were defined, the labeling and annotation of figures, and display/application of statistical tests. I look forward to following it through pre-print.",2023-10-26T22:50:15,elsacouvillon,ELSA COUVILLON,10.1101/2023.09.28.560070,Curcumin and turmeric extract inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus cell entry and Spike mediated cell fusion,"Endah Puji Septisetyani, Dinda Lestari, Komang Alit Paramitasari, Pekik Wiji Prasetyaningrum, Ria Fajarwati Kastian, Adi Santoso, Kartini Eriani",2023-09-29

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.20.563351v1#comment-6309572510,biorxivstage,2,"is manuscript by Pla et al is focused on functional and structural characterization of the Prox1+ meningeal sublayer of the arachnoid, a follow-up on their prior work published in Jan, 2023 ( https://cell.science.org/do.... The authors refer to this layer as ‘subarachnoid lymphatic-like membrane’ or SLYM. For the purposes of this commentary/review, I will use the term Prox1+ sublayer or Prox1+ cells, in line with their work and the work of others showing expression of Prox1 is a defining characteristic of the subtype of meningeal fibroblasts that makes up the inner arachnoid sublayer. The model put forward in their prior work and seek to support with additional data in this manuscript is that the Prox1+ sublayer creates a space within the meninges, a bifurcation of the traditional and well-characterized subarachnoid space, that restricts CSF to support ‘unidirectional glymphatic CSF transport’. This has been called into question by post-review comments by several scientists that study the meninges, including me, and three recent papers that provide evidence from prior work and new data that support that the Prox-1+ cells is part of the sublayer of the arachnoid called the inner arachnoid [referred in prior literature as the ‘arachnoid reticular layer’, ﻿’inner layer arachnoid membrane’, ‘external arachnoid’, ‘arachnoid reticular layer’.]  I do appreciate that the authors in their discussion indicate the SLYM is the same as the inner arachnoid (aka arachnoid reticular layer), this has been raised as a point by me and others. It is helpful to give readers both in and an outside the field context for our sometimes ‘lively’ discussions on this topic. This manuscript is extending some of their prior work, including using new markers recently identified by molecular profiling of the meninges, Dpp4 that is enriched in arachnoid barrier cells by comparison to other cells in the leptomeninges. However, there are several points that need to be clarified and I have concerns about data interpretation. Figure 1 and Discussion Pg 10: The authors suggest that tissue shrinkage could cause artificial ‘cohesion’ of the arachnoid barrier cell (AB cell) layer with the inner arachnoid that contains Prox1+ cells, giving the appearing in fixed tissue and in electron microscopy (EM). How do the authors account for the description of cell-cell junctions (gap junctions, desmosomes) between AB cells and inner arachnoid cells in numerous species? This is not just in EM, the genes for gap junctions are highly expressed in arachnoid cells. These cell-cell junctions had to be created in a live animal or human between cells that are in close enough proximity for the cells to touch. The two papers they cite as support for their model (Nabeshima et al., 1974 and Vandenabeele et al., 1996) both describe these contacts in detail, as do many other papers. One way to address this in a comprehensive way would be to perform EM on Prox1-GFP animals, use immunogold to label GFP and look for presence of absence of cell-cell junctions between AB cell and Prox1+ cells at different regions of the meninges (dorsal, ventral along the A-P axis). Another option, though more challenging, the authors could use proximity ligation approaches or Bio-ID to probe protein-protein interaction between cell surface molecules differentially expressed by AB cell and inner arachnoid Prox1+ cells; this will allow them to observe after tissue shrinkage how close AB cell and inner arachnoid sublayers are in live animals. At this point, showing that brain tissue shrinks is insufficient evidence to claim that AB cell-Prox1+ sublayer positioning is an artifact of fixation and tissue shrinkage, particularly considering other data that supports these cells are adhered to each other in a live animal. Figure 2: The authors suggest that Figure 2 data supports their model that the Prox1+ layer forms a continuous, barrier forming layer that defines the perivascular space or lower subarachnoid space. However, I have concerns with their experimental design & interpretation. They use intracisterna tracer injection of Evan’s Blue or BSA-647, remove the brain from the calvaria and do fluorescent macroscopic imaging of the brain, fix the tissue and then stain it with antibodies to Dpp4, a protein that is enriched in arachnoid barrier cells by comparison to other leptomeningeal fibroblasts (Pietta et al., 2023). They go on to show imaging of Prox1-GFP, Dpp4 using confocal and 2-photon imaging of the calvaria with dura attached and the brain. They claim that Dpp4 signal (using this for arachnoid barrier cells) is only in the ‘dura’ attached to skull and not on the brain surface. They conclude that this means that the arachnoid barrier remains attached to the dura, cleanly removed from the leptomeninges, leaving an intact Prox1+ layer sitting above the vasculature and perivascular spaces. In all my years doing brain/meninges dissection, including some of the same methods described here, all the papers I have read on the leptomeninges staining with E-cad or other AB markers I have never observed that the arachnoid barrier layer comes off with the dorsal calvaria/dura in mouse dissections in the manner they claim to observe. Some minor perturbation where the dura/AB does not separate cleanly but nothing like what they describe Fig. 2D. Possibly, enzymatic digestion methods or dissection method could be applied to force separation of the AB cell from the inner arachnoid/pia/vasculature. In reading the methods I don’t see evidence that this was performed. First, I notice there is a weak Dpp4 signal on the brain in their images, far weaker by comparison to the imaging of the dura/calvarium. AB cells are very thin so this is not surprising. I suspect they kept the laser/gain settings the same in imaging the brain and the dura/calvaria, the later has a comparatively brighter signal. An alternate approach is to vibratome section the fixed brains and perform antibody labeling, this would permit higher resolution imaging. I recommend they add better validated and more specific markers of arachnoid barrier cells, like E-cadherin. This would be more rigorous approach to testing for presence or absence of the arachnoid barrier in the brain preparations. Another area of concern is in their interpretation of the Dpp4 signal in their dura/calvarium imaging. They conclude it is coming from AB cells, thinking that it is a specific marker of AB cells. It is, but only by comparison to other fibroblasts in the leptomeninges. The authors should consider that Dpp4 is expressed by other, non-fibroblast cells types in the dura and calvarium. Dpp4 is expressed in a lot tissues, including many immune cells subtypes present in the dura and in osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are found all over the surface of the calvaria and skull base, degrading and remodeling bone. This raises the possibility of the alternate interpretation that the Dpp4 signal they see in the imaging of the dura/calvaria is not in a continuous sheet of AB cells but rather from non-fibroblasts cells in the calvarium that express Dpp4. This is straightforward for the authors to test. They can remove the dura from the calvaria and stain it separately for Dpp4 or separate them post staining, image separately. Alternatively, they can immunolabel cryosections of de-calcified dura/calvaria for specific markers like E-cadherin. This would permit the authors to specifically identify where the E-cadherin+ AB layer is in their preparations. There may be fragments of E-cad in the dura/calvaria sections, but not the continuous layer they show in Fig. 2D. This would match all data that I am aware of, our own findings and their own data in the Science paper from January, specifically Fig. 4E. This data underlies their claim of functional data that the Prox1 layer alone retains the tracer in the lower SAS, the ‘upper SAS’ is lost in the dissection. If the authors find E-cadherin+/Dpp4+ cells on the brain surface, above the Prox1+ layer, this would support the more common model: the SAS as a single space in the cerebral meninges, the inner arachnoid (which contains Prox1+ cells, along with Prox1- cells) forms the ‘roof’ of the SAS and the closely adhered arachnoid barrier layer is the functional barrier Figures 3-7 use paraffin sections of brain preserved (thought substantially shrunk) in the skull. This has the advantage that is allows for visualization of the intact meninges (pia, arachnoid, dura).  The authors use several markers to visualize the meninges in a few different areas. They do show separations of the of the Prox1+ layer from AB cell layer in the ventral part of the brain. This is an interesting observation however it remains to be seen if these separations are happening due to tissue shrinkage, artificially separating layers that are normally in either very close proximity or attached, though with weak cell-cell connections such as gap junctions and desmosomes. The functional relevance of these spaces is not clear. That the Prox1+ cell layer stays continuous when separate from the AB in those basal regions is consistent with the presence of adherens junctions, extensive collagen and other ECM and other junctions between these cells – these cellular features would be permissive to this remaining a continuous sublayer, independent of the AB layer. But Prox1+ cells lack the canonical tight junction complex genes and proteins to make it be a barrier to solutes, so that remains a limitation for any claims of barrier properties. Also, since these spaces are likely artificial some of the experiments proposed in reference to Figure 1 would help to resolve these issues and help us to understand if in specific regions, meningeal layers are organized in a specialized manner to support CSF flow. Independent of this study, I also suggest the authors move away from single markers on adjacent section and instead adopt fluorescent in situ hybridization or multiplex antibody labeling with fluorescent detection that allows multiple rounds of antibody labeling on the same section. For example, it would have aided in interpretation of Figure 3, magenta box that is a high magnification image showing Prox1-GFP signal but with numerous associated nulcei without signal. It I understand the orientation correctly (this is a high mag of ventral meninges – green box), those cells are on the outer part of the arachnoid, the position of AB cell. If the authors used multiple probes or antibody for different cell types on the same section, the identity of these cells would notbe an unknown to the reader. Fig. 7 – the authors show an image of a ventral area, in the region that contains the circle of Willis, that shows there is no Claudin-11/E-cad signal in the meninges near the brain surface, is there no AB cell layer here? I looked at the Allan Brain Atlas sagittal sections in situ for Cldn11 ( https://mouse.brain-map.org... and Cdh1 ( https://mouse.brain-map.org... and in that same brain region and there is a clear signal. What happened to the AB cells in their sections? Is there also separation and the AB signal is not in the image? Fig. 8: I agree that studying prior literature on the meninges, putting their new observations into a historical perspective is important. I fully support this approach. However, I do not agree with their interpretation of the graphics in Nabeshima et al., 1974, reproduced in Orlin et al., 1991 nor do I understand their pseudocoloring in those images of the location of the Prox1+ layer. This could be because they are comparing the comparatively thin mouse leptomeninges with the much larger pig meninges. In the case of Nabeshima et al drawing, this is a graphical summary that, in my opinion, is not intended to reflect mouse meninges. That drawing is based on observations taken from multiple species and areas of the brain and spinal cord. As a result, I am unsure how practical or accurate it is to compare in vivo images to the graphical diagram. A better, more accurate, approach would be to compare their human leptomeninges data from the Science paper (Fig. 3) to Orlin et al. pig meninges, recognizing that the dura remains intact on the pig meninges image. Pig and human meninges are very similar, making this the best comparison with available data. From this readers can consider the following - How does the E-cad, Pdpn1+, Prox1+ signal match up with the section depicting the cellular organization pig meninges? Is the Prox1+ layer identified in human meninges located in the middle of the subarachnoid space as their pseudo-coloring suggests? For the mouse image with Prox1-GFP (cerebral meninges?) I suggest comparing this to EM of mouse cerebral meninges, there are three articles that I am aware of that have adult mouse cerebral leptomeninges EM ( https://doi.org/10.1002/cne... https://cell.cell.com/neuro.... The Pietila et al paper is probably the best because the inner arachnoid cells are molecularly defined as two similar fibroblast populations (Ppp1r1a/Prox1 vs Slc7a11), therefore the authors can use Prox1 expression and blood vessel to match their image with cells within the annotated EM in Figure 1 of Pietila et al. From this, readers can better evaluate the authors’ claims about the location of the Prox1 layer, structural and ultrastructural features using the blood vessel as a neutral reference point. From this, readers can consider the following - What do inner arachnoid cells look like? How are they connected to the arachnoid barrier cells? Is there a space or does the arachnoid appear as a single structure of interconnected cells? The more information readers have to evaluate the data, the better. Discussion: I disagree with the comment in Pg. 9 that a limitation of the Mapunda et al., 2023 study is the VE-cadherin-GFP labels a subpopulation of cells in the dura and therefore is not specific enough to draw any conclusions. The VE-cadherin-GFP does not label the dural fibroblasts, the authors of Mapunda et al. showed that in Figure 1E. It does label dural blood vessels, which is noted in Fig. Supp Fig. 1 and Fig. 6F - these are easy to distinguish in 2-P by the intravenous dye in these experiments. The expression of VE-cadherin-GFP in everything from the dural border cells (which are molecular different from the dural fibroblasts that populate the collagen rich dura that provide SHG signal) to the pia is actually advantageous. It shows the artifact separation of the dura from the dura border cells in the cranial window and skull thinning preps (Supp. Fig 1). This cleavage plane is what is depicted in their Fig. 8 reproduction and is described at length in Orlin et al., 1991 as the area that subdural injections of blood accumulate. Ideally, use of multiple transgenic mouse lines to independently label the layers and sublayers would be used in 2-P. However, as we await development and application of those tools, I believe the Mapunda et al., 2023 paper clearly shows that there is artifact separation of the arachnoid/pia and dura in commonly used imaging windows for 2-P.  This should be considered which interpreting meningeal spaces using this technique and new methods should be developed to avoid this artifact. With regard to the suggestion in their discussion that the term SLYM be used to identify the inner arachnoid cell sublayer as way to aid in study of meningeal layer function, I continue to disagree. This name in part refers to functional features, in particular that it is a mesothelium and has lymphatic-like properties that, in my opinion, remain in question and await further investigation. Also, the properties of the inner arachnoid, that it ‘handles’ CSF, interacts with immune cells and forms a continuous connected layer, these properties are also observed for pia and AB cells, though the details of these functional features are likely different. By choosing anatomic-positional names, that link it to the 3 traditional layer names that have been around for hundreds of years, we are not committing these cell types or layers to specific functional features. Also, defining these cells by their molecular markers, which we know far more about now, also will aid in identification across publications and in generation of new tools to functionally disrupt the meninges for experimental purposes. Finally, I agree with the authors that recognizing that the meninges have regionalized differences in organization is important. Some of this is already known, such has gaps in the E-cadherin+ AB layer as well as different arrangements of the meninges around the basal cisterns that the authors raise in their discussion. Thus, it is important that authors carefully define where their images and analysis are from (which these authors do a good job of) and also recognize that what is observed in one part of the brain or spinal cord may or may not hold true for other regions.  This comment can be extended to include inter-species comparisons, what may be true for mouse models awaits further validation in lower (zebrafish) and higher vertebrates (primate) on the evolutionary tree.",2023-10-26T22:21:36,,Julie Siegenthaler,10.1101/2023.10.20.563351,Structural characterization of SLYM - a 4th cranial meningeal membrane,"Virginia Plá, Styliani Bitsika, Michael Giannetto, Antonio Ladron-de-Guevara, Daniel Gahn Martinez, Yuki Mori, Maiken Nedergaard, Kjeld Møllgård",2023-10-23

I think this is very important for future research regarding T. cruzi and it's genome's contribution to Chagas disease. Sequencing this strain, whose whole genome has never been sequenced, is a significant contribution. Despite some limitations, this was done successfully and I think it will push others to work on sequencing genomes from other strains, particular those from field samples. I think this is a great step for further research in looking at the relation between transposable elements and multigene families. The methodology in this study was very convincing. I especially like the extra steps done to address the limitations of the Busco Score. I think comparing ORF length of assemblies from other strain with similar characteristics really helped improve your methodology. The paper had a logical flow, but I do believe limitations should have been further explained in the discussion. I think this would have really improved this paper. Overall, this was great work that opens up to more questions regarding this field which I hope this team or other researchers would look at in the future. Not only was a whole genome of this strain sequenced, but it was done using ONT nanopore sequence alone which can provide a less expensive method for sequencing T.cruzi genomes.  A few questions that came to mind was how different do you think your results would have been if you used ONT nanopore sequencing with supplementation of other technologies. Also how different would your results have been if you used a field isolated samples instead of a lab strain?

Congratulations on the work. I notice that some discussions on dynamo are not accurate --unfortunately it has happened repetitively in the literature such as stating dynamo requires data with metabolic labeling only and the vector field gives only lear relation between a regulator and its target gene. Related to what discussed here,  with the dynamo vector field one can predict cell states NOT covered by the data. That is, dynamo is a generative model. So the criticism on using embedding is not justified. One uses low-dimensional manifold embedding (e.g. in Dynamo) to simplify the model (with reduced number of parameters to specify), and it is well-established that a dynamical system typically falls to a low-dimensional manifold after a transient period of time. A famous example is the 3-variable Lorenz  model.

It is really exciting to see that receiving both vaccines concurrently enhances the protectiveness of the COVID-19 booster. I have two questions: 1. Why is it that the group that received the two vaccines on different days were not administered the flu vaccine on the same number of days apart after the COVID vaccine? In the study it was stated that the flu shot just needed to be administered any time within 4 weeks from the time of the COVID booster. Could this have made the results more difficult to interpret? If you were to redo the study, do you think that the data would be more reliable if the second group all had the later flu shot administer on the same day, or does that not seem to matter? 2. Why was the Ebola vaccine used as the control vaccine in this case? Thank you!

I had a few questions and recommendations regarding this technique. Have you sequenced T. cruzi, or the Tulahuen strain specifically, with short-read sequencing? Are there any hurdles involved with that? Also, do you think that by assembling this genome using the help of short-read sequencing, you would have gotten a better result?

As the authors have acknowledged, we have never seen evidence in any of our studies of sexual dimorphism in adult presentation with disease or on cardiovascular imaging, either by echocardiography or cardiac MRI. We have seen young men and women suffer cardiovascular complications at similar age of onset in their 20s and 30s. 2. Changes in left atrial area, isovolumic relaxation time and ejection fraction without similar changes in myocardial performance index or global longitudinal strain worry me, as in humans I would expect both to be early indicators of restrictive cardiomyopathy. All of these values are affected by both acute changes in blood pressure (and especially during anaesthesia) and by the longer-term effects of hypertension, so this is an important confounder but again acknowledged. 3. One feature that is expected in human studies of restrictive cardiomyopathy would be corroborative evidence of pulmonary hypertension, occurring as a result of elevated LV end-diastolic pressure, high LA pressure and thereby pulmonary venous hypertension. Was there any TR in the mice model and any measure of TR maximal velocity? 4. I am an adult cardiovascular imaging specialist who practices both echo and CMR. I am only too aware of the variability of echo measures of cardiac function on an intra- and inter-observer basis. At heart rates of 350-450 BPM, I remain very concerned by the reproducibility in small numbers of animals - although I recognise these numbers are considered adequate in the animal physiology world. When I look at the box plots, there is often a wide spread of results, and no idea is given in the manuscript of the intra-observer measurement for example of ejection fraction - I understand that the person was measuring blind and was a single experienced sonographer...but in our practice, we recognise that in experienced hands, EF may vary in humans at up to 10% between scans at heart rates of 70BPM.",2023-10-23T08:13:46,,Richard Steeds,10.1101/2023.10.16.562570,Female Alms1-deficient mice develop echocardiographic features of adult but not infantile Alström Syndrome cardiomyopathy,"Eleanor J.

I understand that the study participants in MassCPR might have enrolled voluntarily. If this is the case, there could be potential selection bias to consider. It might be beneficial for readers to see a demographic table that provides baseline characteristics for both groups. Additionally, it would be helpful to understand the factors that influenced participants to either receive both vaccines simultaneously or at two separate intervals. Clarifying this could help readers discern if there might be any inherent differences between these two groups. It also would be enlightening if you could expand on the potential mechanisms of the specific immune interactions that may be driving the increased IgG1 with concurrent vaccination?

Your research on the immunogenicity of these vaccines, especially in the context of concurrent versus separate administration, is of significant importance in the current landscape of emerging COVID-19 strains. I have a couple of queries that I hope you could kindly address: 1. Given that the influenza vaccine undergoes changes each year to adapt to evolving strains, I am curious about the potential impact of these changes on the observed results. Do you believe that the higher and more durable SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses associated with concurrent administration would remain consistent across different influenza seasons? 2. It appears that your study design involves a comparison between concurrent and separate administration, and the results are promising. Could you kindly provide more information on the research methodology? Specifically, was your study a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and if so, was blinding or randomization implemented?

While the sentence you quoted from reference 14 does say that HDACs are generally associated with inactive genes, it's important to read it in context. Just two sentences later, the authors reveal their observation: ""Our data provide evidence that HATs and HDACs are both targeted to transcribed regions of active genes by phosphorylated RNA Pol II."" The presence of HDACs is a dynamic process. In active regions, HDACs and HATs often coexist in a dynamic equilibrium, influencing the acetylation status of histones. So while the action of histone deacetylation usually leads to gene repression, the presence/localization of HDAC itself is not necessarily an indicator of inactive genes. The last statement in the abstract of reference 14 also supports this: ""Silent genes without any H3K4 methylation signal show no evidence of being bound by HDACs."" In our study, we also observed a similar trend, where active marks correlate well with HDAC1/2/3 presence, further supporting this view. Does this answer your question?

The authors employed an interesting approach with restrictions on species dispersal in the models and the results contribute to predicting the effects of climate change in this biome. We see the importance of focusing on biotic changes and % of range loss, but it is our belief that adding the final predictions for each species in the supplementary material, in terms of maps and range shifts (direction of shift), it would be worth and informative because this information is important for managers and decision makers (those who manage conservation units but also to the researchers working on specific taxa). We also think that including a more detailed discussion about some species that have been modelled in other previous studies could enrich the work and make some of the results obtained here clearer. For example, why species with a wide distribution such as Callicebus barbarabrownae would lose their entire area of suitability in 2060? Other studies, such as Barreto et al. 2021 and Gouveia et al. 2016 found different results, could you attribute this to the methodological choices? We think the words used in the bibliographic review were not wide enough to include studies with mammals in the Caatinga because some important references are out of the included papers. The chosen words are mainly related to the biome or region. Maybe another approach would be to review occurrence records in a systematic way looking for articles with species names (as keyword) based on a preliminary list of mammals. Including latitude and longitude in the maps it would be more informative and including political division of states could help to subside discussion for specific regions of Caatinga. We wrote this comment during a meeting to discuss preprint papers that occurred by September, but I was able to post it just now. I saw that the paper was accepted yesterday, so I am not sure if our suggestions/questions will have some worth to the authors (feel free to reply or not), but we decided to contribute with them anyway.

We have addressed the latter issue by uploading our data download script, keggpuller.py, to the project Github.  This code was used to download molecule records from the KEGG database and store them in a commma-separated value format.  This resulted in 6669 records.  The dataset was then further processed to a simpler form to reduce each record to a SMILES string followed by a comma-separated list of letters indicating pathway class membership (this is smiles_property.txt).  We refer to this as the multi-class dataset.  We also considered the problem of classification of a compound as either being a member of a single, given pathway class or not.  We refer to the resulting dataset as the single-class dataset. The authors are correct that the resulting datasets contain duplicate entries.  The single-class dataset contains six duplicates out of 4545, while the multi-class dataset contains 1740 out of 6669. We have re-run our experiments on the datasets with duplicates removed.  The results for single-class classification did not change.  The table of results for multi-class classification can be found at this location. We note that the accuracies of most methods dropped, including ours.  The accuracy statistics for ensemble logistic regression increased. However, we also note that the central results of our paper remain intact -- the relative ordering of accuracy of different machine learning methods (other than ensemble logistic regression) on the data remains the same, and the superiority of our method over the others that we evaluated remains.  Indeed, this is expected because we ran all methods on the same datasets, using the same training/test split methodology. We have uploaded the de-duplicated datasets to the Github page.  The authors are correct to encourage the use of the de-duplicated datasets.  We will also post a correction to our paper.",2023-10-17T00:19:42,abrammagner,Abram Magner,10.1101/2023.10.03.560711,A cautionary tale about properly vetting datasets used in supervised learning predicting metabolic pathway involvement,"Erik D.

Even if the code was there it would be difficult to reproduce – stata is not very widely used. Does the analysis decisively link badger culling to decline in bovine TB in cattle? Culling is confounded with complex changes to gamma and other testing and other measures. There are places in the ms where a claim is made for a link ‘The effect of badger culling…’ but then later:  ‘However, this data analysis cannot explicitly distinguish…….’ APHA have stated more than once that the breakdown data alone are insufficient to show an effect of culling. However, the DID approach is inappropriate because the 52 cull and pre-cull study areas are surrounded by and in close contact with each other and so are not adequately discrete in space and time, breaking a DID requirement. Notably in the four-year period 2016/17 -2019/20 pre-cull and cull areas closely juxta position. Pre-cull and cull interventions may influence change in adjacent pre-cull and cull areas in an irregular and unpredictable manner, via the constant movement of cattle with different intervention histories. Some of the very important bTB testing controls used and the timing of their introduction are not correctly described and some not even mentioned. The approach mixes data from 46 High Risk Area study areas with 6 from the Edge Area. These have very different epidemiological and disease control history profiles and the reason for mixing them is not explained. Pre-cull gamma testing was intense in the Edge Area. While the manuscript mentions additional gamma testing from 2017, gamma testing was erratic between areas and over time. There were considerable numbers of gamma reactors in many of the cull areas in cull years 1 and 2 with similar disclosures to years 3 and 4 but pre-cull use in the HRA was generally low. In both HRA and Edge areas OTFW incidence was declining when many of the additional disease control rules were intensified, and badger culling introduced. The government chief scientist view was that distinguishing and determining with any precision any contribution of badger culling to disease control is not possible, is therefore maintained. It is impossible to distinguish between the effects of badger culling and disease control measures using the DID approach in any meaningful way. The comment made on being unable to match cull and control is unevidenced and a 2022 published and peer reviewed study of this has not been cited, nor alternative approaches such as matching a series of individual farms in cull and control which would have been simpler and easier to monitor on a quarterly basis since 2018, as was the expectation of a High Court ruling. The suggestion that incidence is the better indicator of true burden goes against APHA’s own epidemiology and the greatly clarified understanding of SICCT test sensitivity and specificity. The specificity change resulting from SICCT severe interpretation can be estimated and applied to OTFS, providing, with OTFW, a safe index of known infection. Gamma testing has shown numbers of unidentified reactors in both identified bTB infected and unidentified herds, and this ‘hidden’ reservoir remains undocumented although its size can be deduced. OTFW relates by its nature to older infections with lesions, yet it is newer infections (OTFS) that indicate disease control success (elimination) more accurately, over time. There is no reason to believe that OTFS+OTFW (as above) is not the superior approach and that OTFW is half of the full picture. During the RBCT, prevalence was growing considerably and OTFS rising so the analogy made in this manuscript is inappropriate and trying unconvincingly to defend the historic reference source. By reducing the pre-cull analysis to one data point the significant pre-cull decline is hidden and this also masks true trends. Because the methods are inappropriate, the results are flawed and the conclusions are flawed. There is no way to distinguish between different interventions and change in herd breakdowns since 2013 with the approach taken. There is also need to see clarification of the analysis that is presented in the Appendix – this does not seem to  be the output from the constrained DID analysis, but something else not fully described in methods which  ‘matches’ it  – which stata  process was used ? It is the first analysis referred to in the main text. As well as showing that the BCP effect accounts for less than 2% of breakdowns it doesn’t look quite right that the BCP effect is based on error dof – pseudoreplication?",2023-10-10T13:37:06,disqus_mgwPkHbXfP,Tom Langton,10.1101/2023.09.04.556191,Difference in Differences analysis evaluates the effects of the Badger Control Policy on Bovine Tuberculosis in England,"Colin P.D.

This pattern, however, have been already stated in a recent study (Veron et al. 2019). In this sense, the discussion about the processes involved in the origin of such floras could be improved by the ideas presented by Vasconcelos et al. (2021). In this study, the authors propose that the terms neoendemism and paleoendemism should be replaced by assessment in relation to the actual biogeographic and macroevolutionary processes that had occurred. Moreover, although the authors provide a methodological discussion regarding the scale of the areas analyzed, a stronger emphasis should be put on it. Several large continental areas, for instance, represent large vegetation domains (i.e., Mata Atlântica and Cerrado), which include high number of endemism however unevenly scattered in island-like habitats throughout these areas. 1.

As an example of correlation, in discussion (line 437), the authors report that the higher taxonomic, functional, and spectral diversity found at middle elevations has already been tested all over the world. Could the focus of the hypotheses be stated as the process(es) behind these patterns instead of the correlations per se? 2. The species Phacelia secunda was selected to analyze intraspecific trends between traits and environment, based on the fact that it is present across the elevation gradient (line 224).

I will refer to the energy-minimized structures as ""relaxed"" and otherwise ""unrelaxed"". In this work I only analyzed the relaxed structures. There were so many different things to check that I never got round to checking the effect of energy minimization originally, but I did make sure to save all of the unrelaxed structures. So I re-ran some of the analyses (originally done on the relaxed structures) with the unrelaxed structures. (1: Structure correlations) When comparing AF-PDB correlations for pairs of structures where sequences differ by 1-3 mutations, relaxed and unrelaxed structures give almost identical results. For the case of no mutations, the correlations are actually higher for unrelaxed structures (r=0.38) compared to relaxed structures (r=0.33). This would reduce the residual correlations in Figure 1H by about 0.05. For reference, in Figure 1H the residual AF-PDB correlations range from about 0.15 to 0.35. (2: Blue fluorescence correlation) I checked the strongest AF-phenotype correlation, from Figure 2C. For unrelaxed I get r = -0.92, for relaxed I get r = -0.93. It seems that the energy minimization does help, but it is certainly a minor part of the overall prediction. Bear in mind that this analysis is nowhere near as extensive as what went into the paper, so I might have missed something. The paper has now been accepted, so I don't think it is possible to add this in a new version. Thanks again for asking this important question. I'm personally glad to know the answer (even if it is a bit preliminary).",2023-10-05T06:23:48,disqus_kHaiH8cKyG,John McBride,10.1101/2022.04.14.488301,AlphaFold2 can predict single-mutation effects,"John M.

LIVe hosts an activity called the ""Preprint Club,"" where we select preprints for reading and critical review. I have chosen your preprint: ""The Penetration of Sunflower Root Tissues by the Parasitic Plant Orobanche cumana Wallr. is Intracellular."" This is an interesting, well-written, and well-illustrated paper describing a robust and scientifically sound study. The study demonstrates that intrusive cells invade living host cells intracellularly, leading to the degradation of the cell wall. These results can contribute to the selection of candidate genes for resistance to the parasitic plant Orobanche cumana. In our discussion of the paper, we have some suggestions for you to consider. In general, the mechanism of intracellular and extracellular penetration of haustorium has been discussed in parasitic plants. Therefore, we suggest that the main contribution of the article to the state of the art of parasitic plants should be made clear in the introduction, discussion, and conclusion. Title Line 2: I suggest including the name of the sunflower species and the plant families in the title, and removing the full stop. Line 5: What is the authors' affiliation? I suggest including this information. Key message Line 12: Please check the species name Helianthus annus L. It looks like a letter ""u"" ( Helianthus annu u s L.) is missing. Line 17: I suggest removing Orobanche cumana from the keywords, as it is already in the title, and adding another keyword to broaden the scope of article search. Introduction Line 42: I suggest including the author of Orobanche cumana. Line 43: Remove the comma. Line 44: Which component of the root exudates are you referring to? Could you specify? Line 54: Could you please provide the full name of the gene? Line 57: I believe it's important to specify how the phloem connection is established, as it has received less coverage in the literature compared to xylem connection. Line 72: I suggest leaving only 'Orobanchaceae' in the parentheses. Line 74: For standardization, include the family name 'Pelargonium zonale' and remove 'family' from the parentheses for 'Convolvulaceae.' The ending 'aceae' already indicates the family."" Materials and methods What is the sample number? I suggest including light microscopy and Toluidine Blue O staining analyzes in the text. Results and discussion Line 170: Insert a comma after “By contrast” Lines 181-183: I was intrigued by how the nutrient transfer process occurs in the early stages. Do you have any hypotheses? Figures: It would be interesting to insert an acronym in the figures indicating parasite plant (P) and host plant (H), as well as the host and parasitic plant tissues. Figures: I suggest positioning the figures vertically, as the sections are longitudinal. Concluding remarks Could you provide answers to questions 2 and 3 and consider including at least one sentence addressing these questions posed in the introduction? References Lines 243, 286, 292, 294: Please check the reference pages. Line 254: Please verify whether the journal name should be abbreviated. Lines 255 and 258: Please check if the author's last name is Dos Santos or just Santos.
