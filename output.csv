The following is a summary of our conversation with two of the authors of this preprint. The conversation with Dr. Kevin Gardner and Danielle Swingle revolved around their research on the diversity of function and higher-order structure within HWE sensor histidine kinases. The key point of their preprint is the exploration of the variability in this family of histidine kinases, challenging the conventional understanding that they need to be membrane-bound or always exist as dimers. Their research has identified monomers, constitutive dimers, and proteins that fluctuate between these states. Interestingly, they found a light-sensitive histidine kinase that is active in the dark, contrary to expectations of the rest of the family. The figure they are most proud of presents different clusters of homologs of the light-activated monomer that their lab discovered in 2014, clustering into three different families. It also includes two models: one of a monomer sensing kinase and another of a dimer sensing kinase. The authors appreciated the feedback they received on their initial preprint, which was submitted through eLife. The feedback was constructive and inspired them to revise their work post-Covid, resulting in the current Version 2 of the preprint. Potential areas of confusion might arise from their efforts to engineer a monomeric HK based on their discoveries, specifically in distinguishing the different regions between the monomer/dimer swap. They also highlighted the value of preprints in facilitating dialogue about emerging science, offering a balance between the immediacy of social media and the lengthy review process of traditional publishing. Looking forward, they are interested in exploring reverse signaling proteins and their intriguing dynamics and structural components. This research offers a fresh perspective on histidine kinases, challenging conventional understanding and opening up new avenues for exploration. The community is encouraged to provide feedback and engage in dialogue to further enrich this research.",2023-07-24T14:19:58,maddyrostad,Madeleine Rostad,10.1101/2020.07.08.194225,Diversity of function and higher-order structure within HWE sensor histidine kinases,"Igor Dikiy, Danielle Swingle, Kaitlyn Toy, Uthama R.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/12/17/496521#comment-6236563800,biorxivstage,1,"Forgive me if this comment is a duplicate, I tried to post already, but it was marked as spam. I believe that this manuscript is largely based on a missunderstanding of the nature of ATAC-seq data. It is important that people processing ATAC-seq data with MACS use single end mode, together with the `--no-model`, `--extsize` and `--shift` options. In correct usage of tools can easily lead to sub-optimal results. The MACS tool was original built to analyse ChIP-seq data when most sequencing data was single-ended, and the use of it in the default single-end mode when the data is pair-ended, can indeed lead to results that could be better if the full data set was considered. In ChIP-seq DNA is fragmented, and then fragments that are bound by a protein factor are isolated by immunoprecipitation. The protein factor could be bound at any place in the recovered fragment, but we only sequence the ends. Because fragmentation positions are random, we can look at the genome positions that are covered by the most fragments, and identify them as the most likely binding positions for the protein factor of interest. Because a protein factor could be bound anywhere in a fragement, it is imporant to know the extent of the fragment. In the days of single-end sequencing, this could only be achieved by guess work, and clever statistics. An average fragment size would be estimated from the data, and single end reads extended to cover this. But this was always only a guess. With pair-ended data this guess work is unneccessary, as we know where the ends are. So if you have paired-end ChIP-seq data, and use single end mode in MACS2, you are a) discarding half the data, and b) making a guess at fragment length when you don't need to guess. However, ny guess is that in practice the differences are fairly minor. However, this manuscript is based not on ChIP-seq data, but on ATAC-seq data and ATAC-seq data is fundementally different in nature.  In ATAC-seq we use a transposase to create DNA fragments by ""transposing"" a sequencing adaptor into the genome. Since the transposase can only attack nucleosome free DNA, we can use the locations of transposition to identify regions of open chromatin. Whereas in ChIP-seq we are trying to identify a single location, which, for a single-fragment, could be anywhere in that fragment, in ATAC-seq we know exactly where the location of interest is for any fragment. Actaully there are two locations of interest, and they are located exactly at either end of the fragment. The area inbetween these two ends is of no interest. In ATAC-seq, rather than read pairs being connected to come up with a candidate region for protein binding (as in ChIP-seq), they are two seperate, independent, and unconnected samples from all open-chromatin locations in the genome, and should be treated thus. Consider the following situation with two nucleosome free regions and some ATAC reads (* marks closed chormatin, - open) |>>> |>>> |>>> |>>>         <<<| *********|---------|*********|---------|********* Using MACS in paired end mode would lead to the following depth profile: ############## ################## ####################### ########################### *********|---------|*********|---------|********* That is, the two nucleosome free regions are merged into a single extended peak. However, if we use the standard ATAC-seq approach of treating each read as independent (either map both ends as single ended, or map paired-end and then alter flags to mark all reads as read1), shift the read 3' by X bases and then extend the read by 2X bases to get this: |>>>>>|                  | |>>>>>|                  | |>>>>>|         | |>>>>>|         | *********|---------|*********|---------|********* And then with MACS2 in `--no-model` mode, you would get this depth profile: ## #                ###### ###########           ######## ###############       ############ *********|---------|*********|---------|********* That is there are two peaks, that more or less match the two open chromatin regions.",2023-07-21T14:08:39,ian_sudbery,Ian Sudbery,10.1101/496521,Improved peak-calling with MACS2,John M.

Such a diversity, and putative inheritance from the father with dementia at the age of 83, suggests that additional factors may be required to result in AD, at least before the age of 70-75, knowing that LOAD is very common. This variant may not be sufficient, to my opinion, to cause AD, although it seems to be a strong determinant. I also found interesting to see that we also have the same variant as in this work, in one of our (unpublished) patients (R953C). It is a sporadic case with an age at onset of 56 years, APOE genotype 3-4, unaffected parents at 80, large family, no other case except a paternal grandmother with an age at onset of 80. Unless there is a de novo mutation, which we could not check yet, it is not consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. I hope we can see if one of the parents is a carrier or not, as this will help us better understand the penetrance of the variant. This paper adds another variant to the increasing list of variants with a maturation defect. We previously reported 15 variants with a similar effect in a previous paper (Rovelet-Lecrux et al., Acta Neuropathologica Communications 2021) after expression of 70 missense variants in HEK cells. We selected 3 variants with such an effect and 2 without, to further evaluate them in IPSCs after Crispr/cas9 introduction, and found that all three selected missense variants showed a maturation defect, including one with a milder effect. The 2 variants with the strongest maturation defect showed significantly increased secreted Abeta levels, clearly linking these variants to AD pathophysiology. It is however not clear why, in the current paper, the authors mention our own by paper with the following sentence: ""Furthermore, a larger screen of 70 SORL1 coding variants suggested that impaired maturation may be general for dysfunctional proteins although no correlation to AD was established."" We only studied SORL1 and we showed a direct link with AD for these specific variants, with the above-mentioned mechanism. We only discussed the fact that this way, for a missense variant, to result in a loss of function of its encoded protein, has been described in other diseases, but in our work we only studed SORL1, there must be a misunderstanding on this point.",2023-07-21T13:53:27,gael_nicolas,Gaël Nicolas,10.1101/2023.07.01.547348,A familial missense variant in the AD gene SORL1 impairs its maturation and endosomal sorting,"Elnaz Fazeli, Daniel D.

The following is a summary of our conversation with one of the authors of this preprint. Dr. Lauren Porter's discussion focused on her research on the evolutionary selection of proteins that can assume different folds, particularly in response to stimuli. The key point of the preprint is the prediction of sequence features for fold-switching proteins, which undergo relatively dramatic secondary and tertiary structure changes. They specifically study homologs that switch from an alpha-helical to a beta-sheet state, a significant change. Their research suggests that fold-switching is not random but is evolutionarily selected, a finding that challenges current understanding in the field. Dr. Porter’s favorite figure connects different sequence alignments with the helical and beta sheet structures, identifying positions in the alignment that make unique contacts to the beta sheet fold and the alpha sheet fold. Dr. Porter is particularly interested in feedback on their argument that evolution selects for these proteins and makes them different. She acknowledged that some of the figures might be hard to interpret for different communities (e.g. evolutionary biologists might find some protein structure aspects confusing and some of the evolutionary insights to be obvious, whereas structural biologists might be surprised by some of the evolutionary biology). Looking forward, they plan to use these results to build on existing methodology to reliably predict two folds from one sequence. They hope to achieve this within the next year. Dr. Porter also shared her thoughts on the preprinting system, discussing the complications around reviewing preprints and benchmarking against methods that have not yet been peer-reviewed. She also expressed how having more accountability in terms of commenting and making changes to preprints could elevate the scientific discourse. This preprint presents a novel perspective on the evolutionary selection of fold-switching proteins.

The following is a summary of our conversation with one of the authors of this preprint. Dr. Lauren Jackson's discussion focused on her research on the interaction between β’-COP and the ArfGAP, Glo3, and its role in maintaining post-Golgi cargo recycling. The key point of the preprint is the identification of how a key regulatory molecule (a GAP protein) regulates an important membrane trafficking co-complex. They knew these two elements interacted, but pinpointing where the interaction was happening among the seven subunits was challenging. They identified specific amino acids and tested predictions in a yeast model system. The figure they are most proud of, Figure 4, was improved through peer review, as reviewers requested an additional experiment to be conducted in cells. This figure demonstrated the interaction from both perspectives. Dr. Jackson was excited to get the preprint out there, as it allowed her to attend an online conference and gain visibility during a challenging time. She also found preprints to be beneficial for grant applications. Most of the feedback they received came from peer review, and the preprint story differs from the final published version as they took out a crystal structure and turned it into its own paper during the review process. Potential areas of confusion might arise from the fact that they never nailed down the structure of the interaction between β’-COP and Glo3. They faced technical challenges and some methods suggested by reviewers had already been attempted but were unsuccessful and were outlined in the correspondence with the reviewers coordinated by the journal. Looking forward, they plan to do more structural biology to get the supercomplex (potentially by tomography or by moving in the nanodisc direction, having done some work on tubules). Dr. Jackson shared her positive experiences with preprints, noting their importance and the benefit of having a pool of reviewers.

The following is a summary of our conversation with one of the authors of this preprint. Dr. Alex Guseman's discussion centered on his research on inhibiting SARS-CoV2 viral entry by targeting spike glycans. The key point of the preprint is the interaction of lectins with spike proteins, which facilitates viral entry. The research uses dynamic light scattering to demonstrate that treatment with lectins rapidly aggregates spike proteins. The team used fluorescence binding assays to fit an isotherm to a 1:1 ratio, although the exact stoichiometry remains unknown. The figure they consider most important proposes that multivalent interactions are essential and that these interactions depend on glycans. Interestingly, they found that other Covid variants are also inhibited. Potential areas of confusion might arise from understanding the concept of multivalent interaction and the importance of stoichiometry in the interaction of spikes with the BOA lectin. The team emphasized that these interactions are not within spike proteins, but rather between BOA and multiple other spikes. The team is seeking feedback on additional experiments for future studies that could further explore their model. While animal models of infection may be the ultimate test, this is beyond the scope of this study for both effort and cost. The authors are looking for community feedback on how future  biophysical experiments can probe the nature of the multivalent interactions. Since the preprint was posted, some other lectins have been tested and shown to have an inhibitory effect. The team believes it might be valuable to look at other interactions in the future. They also want to explore more about the monovalent version that is not interacting in the same way. Dr. Guseman's experience with preprint feedback has been positive.

I interpret this as background signal as these mice do not express hPGRN (and the signal is not due to mPGRN due to similar concentrations in the GRN-KO mice). In Figure 2C, the authors show hPGRN levels in WT mice to be 0, while the +AAV mice express hPGRN ~2000 ng/mg. Why is there a different 'background' to this assay between the experiments for these two figures for WT mice? #2: In Figure 1e, the authors show that AAV(L):bPGRN treatment enhances brain hPGRN to ~7000 ng/mg in Grn KO mice. In Figure 2D, the authors show that AAV(L):bPGRN treatment enhances hPGRN in the brain to 20 ng/mg in DKO mice. Both analyzed 9 weeks post injection. Is it surprising that there are over two orders of magnitude in the difference of brain hPGRN enhancement between the Grn KO mice and the DKO mice? I do recognize that these mice were treated with AAV(L):bPGRN at different ages--for Fig 1, these mice were 4-5 months old, and for Fig 2, the mice were injected at 6 weeks of age. I don't see how that could contribute to such substantial differences in hPGRN concentrations. -- Thanks in advance for any clarification here - feel like I'm missing an important detail here that's leading to my confusion.",2023-07-18T18:41:45,disqus_rotilT0XE6,Zach Rosenthal,10.1101/2023.07.14.549089,Rescue of FTLD-associated TDP-43 pathology and neurodegeneration by peripheral AAV-mediated expression of brain-penetrant progranulin,"Marvin Reich, Matthew J.

The following is a summary of our conversation with one of the authors of this preprint. Dr. Stephanie Wankowicz's discussion centered on her research on the refinement of multiconformer ensemble models from multi-temperature X-ray diffraction data. The key point of the preprint is not the introduction of a new technique, but rather a tutorial for people to collect and process crystallography datasets. One of the steps in this tutorial is the creation of multi-conformer models, which represent different protein states. The work builds on existing methodology, emphasizing that multiconformer models in high-resolution structures provide a better model. Her favorite figure, Figure 1, guides people through the steps to process, model, and refine multi-temperature X-ray data. However, she also highlighted a figure that shows the ability to capture different conformations of water, demonstrating the power of this technique. Dr. Wankowicz is seeking feedback on the clarity of the paper, particularly from individuals who have never used this technique before. She is also interested in suggestions on how the algorithm could be improved. She acknowledged that readers might find the paper confusing if they are not willing to test the tool/method directly, emphasizing the need for user experience. She shared her positive experiences with preprints, noting that they could benefit the scientific community by making the review process of data more transparent. She also suggested that she has become a better reader of papers because she has had to analyze the validity of preprints herself. This preprint offers a valuable tutorial on the refinement of multiconformer ensemble models from multi-temperature X-ray diffraction data.

The following is a summary of our conversation with the authors of this preprint. Dr. Neel Shah and Anne van Vlimmeren's preprint, titled ""The pathogenic T42A mutation in SHP2 rewires interaction specificity and enhances signaling,"" focuses on the study of a phosphatase with a variety of disease-associated mutations. The mutation they most focused on is deep in the N-SH2 binding pocket, and while it was known to alter binding affinity, the researchers discovered that it also changes specificity. This mutation results in the loss of a hydrogen bond, but surprisingly, this enhances binding affinity. The mutation also confers a specificity change for many peptides. The researchers' favorite figure in the preprint is the one that tested different peptides and where they mutated lysine 55 to arginine, showing that the effects of this residue were coupled to residue 42. They are most excited to receive feedback on how the binding correlates to cell signaling and whether this correlates 1:1 with binding affinity. Long term, they are interested in how to further explore the broader cellular interactions of this mutant. They anticipate that some might find the three other mutants that impact binding affinity to a lesser extent confusing. The researchers are also curious to see if people are as compelled by the complementarity of their MD and biochemistry as they are, and what potential blind spots they might have missed. The researchers are strong advocates for preprints, seeing too many upsides to not use them. They find them helpful when applying for grants as they show progress, and believe that getting preprints out should be equally celebrated as publishing to a journal.

The following is a summary of our conversation with the authors of this preprint. The discussion with Dr. Joey Davis and Barrett Powell focused on their research on learning structural heterogeneity from cryo-electron sub-tomograms with tomoDRGN. The key point of their preprint is the untapped potential in cryoET datasets for understanding the spatial distribution of different complexes and conformations in the cell. They describe a different approach using machine learning methods, with the goal of putting things in a cellular context. The researchers faced challenges in exploring how portable their original cryoDRGN framework is to Electron Tomography (ET) data. While some elements worked well, such as the decoder network, encoding the raw data was difficult due to the shift from one particle being one image to having multiple images of a particle. Their favorite figure, Figure 6, demonstrates the potential of tomography to generate high-resolution, individualized pictures. They feel that this figure in particular highlights the promise of visualizing how a complex, such as the ribosome, may adopt different structures and interact with distinct cofactors depending on its subcellular localization. The researchers are excited about the possibility of discovering new biology through their paper and are eager to continue hearing feedback on use cases, particularly in cases where tomoDRGN has helped users uncover structural heterogeneity that helps them better understand how their complexes of interest work. They also expressed some concern about potential confusion regarding the generative model and the process of classification. Looking forward, they plan to explore the relative species of ribosomes and correlations between complexes. They also mentioned how many emerging ideas in the field are indicating paths to computational shortcuts for processing the tilt-image-series data directly without explicitly generating tomograms - success in this area could be a game-changer in the field.

I looked into the alignment simulation methods because I was particularly intereseted in how you simulated indels. The ""mimick"" method is very interesting. I haven't seen that before. It sounds like it could produce much more realistic alignments, and if so - I would highlight this method to bring it to the attention of our community. A problem with simulations based on some indel model is that they unrealistically use a fixed indel rate across the alignment. Natural protein sequences have large variation in indel rates. When I tested the effect of alignment errors on positive selection inference I saw that without indel rate variation there wasn't a significant effect, but when I introduced indel rate variation I saw a strong effect. I did that by simulating alignment blocks with different indel rates, which I inferred from empirical alignments of HIV protein sequences. Best, Eyal Privman Privman, E., Penn, O., & Pupko, T.

The manuscript’s hypothesis of an endonuclease “fingerprint” of a synthetic origin in the SARS2 genome makes a testable claim: if regions around the sites composing the “fingerprint” are sampled in nature, engineered nucleotides will stick out like a sore thumb. Authors were told about this test in the first week of September 2022 when people independently noted the recombinant evolutionary history and that almost all elements in the “fingerprint” are sampled in a handful of the most closely related genomes. Others rephrased essentially the same test, with Francois Balloux commenting to Alex Washburne on September 5, 2022: Assuming we wished to follow up on this, the next step would be to test if high homology can be found to different Sarbecoviruses for (some of) the 6 fragments defined by the restrictions site (ie. there's no reason to expect natural breakpoints to match restriction sites). This step was not taken. And it was not a difficult step. Shortly after the manuscript’s publication, Crits-Cristoph and colleagues rigorously showed that the hypothesis fails this test: https://github.com/alexcritschristoph/ancestral_reconstruction_endonucleases – the conclusion is noteworthy considering the public record, which demonstrates bias in site selection and post hoc selection of statistical tests. In fact, this manuscript’s hypothesis gained attention only after Justin Kinney, who is acknowledged for his assistance on the manuscripted, prompted the discussion by suggesting a different hypothesis about a different restriction endonuclease, BsaXI. In the comments section of V1 of this manuscript, Alex Washburne proposed a second test of his hypothesis, claiming that “the rapid loss of this pattern is indicative of its evolutionary instability, suggesting what we observe in the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral state is not a stable pattern resulting from recombination, but a transient, unstable pattern that perhaps went against selection and reverted back once the infectious clone was subjected to selection from considerable onward transmission.” While this statement makes some dubious claims and another test is not needed, this comment shows that Washburne considers fitness changes in mutations at these sites to be another test of his hypothesis. This is a test that Washburne can conduct based upon published analysis of the fitness impacts of mutations: https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS2-mut-fitness – as Washburne and co-authors have not published the results of this test, I will briefly do so here. The mean, median, maximum, and minimum fitness change estimated for point mutations in the “fingerprint” of the 5 BsmBI or BsaI sites in SARS2 are -1.7, -1.4, 2.2, and -6.5. The same calculations for 1000 random samples of 30 nucleotides give -1.7, -1.5, 1.8, and -6.4  (see link above on interpreting these numbers, or simply note their similarity). A search on https://cov-spectrum.org/ shows that point mutations or deletions for one or more of these 30 nucleotides have been reported in 0.75% of sequences sampled in the most recent 3 months. Point mutations or deletions for one or more of 30 random nucleotides (a single random sample; results will vary) have been reported in 0.96% of sequences in the same period. All in all, the main point of interest in these 30 nucleotides is the attention given a hypothesis of a “fingerprint” of synthetic origin that was effectively disproven before this manuscript was published. Finally, considering the countless number of equivalent hypotheses, I suggest that a better effort would be immune to these tests (and I can think of at least one example myself). It is critical that a manuscript of this type demonstrate that there is an unbiased rationale behind the hypotheses tested and that is plainly not the case here. One simply needs to observe that “longest fragment” is referred to 20 times in the manuscript, while “shortest fragment” goes unmentioned.",2023-07-14T23:30:00,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,10.1101/2022.10.18.512756,Endonuclease fingerprint indicates a synthetic origin of SARS-CoV-2,"Valentin Bruttel, Alex Washburne, Antonius VanDongen",2023-04-11

By solving the structure of ASNS and performing 3DVA, they suggest that a single side chain's dynamic motion (Arg142) regulates the interconversion between open and closed forms of an intramolecular tunnel. The opening of this tunnel allows for the translocation of ammonia, which is necessary for ASNS’s catalytic function. MD followed up on this initial finding to determine exactly how The study highlights the power of cryo-EM in identifying localized conformational changes and demonstrates how conformational dynamics can regulate the function of metabolic enzymes with multiple active sites. However, the lack of experimental electron density shown in the figures (or available publicly) makes it difficult to assess the claims in this study. Additional forward tests of the importance of this blockage via mutagenesis may also uncover why it must be regulated. If this is out of the scope of the current paper, it should be hypothesized and speculated upon in the discussion. Major Points: 1. 	In your figures, Please show electron density and all individual atomic positions. This includes Fig. 1d, 2a, and all of Figure 3. 2. 	Please show the PCA of the 3DVA. Clarify whether this was done on the entire structure or the tunneling residues. If done on the entire protein, please comment and show if other changes were seen elsewhere. 3. 	In the RMSD analysis, please clarify what EM coordinates you are using. Are you comparing all structures from the 3DVA? Please also provide raw values as well as normalized values. 4. 	Your results do not support the claim ‘Our results suggest that changes in the C-terminal active site are propagated over a distance of approximately 20 Å, leading to tunnel opening and ammonia translocation’. While the data here shows that the tunnel can move between an open and closed state in apo form as part of the native fluctuations (revealed by the PCA analysis). No information is presented on how this information is propagated nor how the active site or binding interacts with this motion. Please change the wording of this or explain the mechanism. Minor Points: 1. 	Neither the PDB nor the map is publicly available, making it difficult to examine the structures and map independently. Please release them. Also, include information and metrics regarding map sharpening and map-to-model fit. Zenodo is a good option for the 100 structures from the PCA analysis. 2. 	In Figure 1d, please label the amino acids and chains. Please provide experimental density corresponding to the positions of these residues in this figure or a supplementary figure. 3. 	In Figure 2a, please provide a legend for what each color represents. 4. 	How did you determine 5 PCAs for the 3DVA analysis? 5. 	Please provide details on the normalized RMSF. How was this normalization done? 6. 	In Figure 4, please provide a legend for all colors of amino acids and tunneling. 7.         Please deposit the coordinate files for the 100 structures used in the 3DVA study and (ideally also the two MD-derived trajectories on Zenodo or a similar repository).

""Than"" in the last clause seems to imply that 4 dpi activation was more effective than other strategies, which is not what is shown. I think simply removing ""than"" would correct the sentence to indicate that 4 dpi activation is less efficacious than sustained, 0 dpi or 2 dpi, which is what the figure shows.

This algorithm exemplifies the application of NLP methods in the context of biological data. The tool utilizes a Market Basket analysis to identify known co-occurring TFs based on the locations of their transcription factor binding sites, regardless of the data source. The authors have made modifications to the Market Basket approach to accommodate the specificities of the transcription factor regulation process. The enhanced model takes into account the multiple occurrences of the same TFBS within a defined window. Moreover, the algorithm considers the order and orientation of co-occurring TFs, which represents a significant improvement over previously published tools. Lastly, the tool performs a sophisticated analysis of identified TF pairs, which is visualized using various analytical tools, including differential and orientation analysis, calculation of TFBS distance to a transcription start site, and network reconstruction. The tool's performance was compared to existing tools and validated using open-source data. The authors made several modifications to the Market Basket approach; however, the descriptive connection between different parts of the algorithm is somewhat unclear at times. For instance, they mention overcoming the threshold issue of the cosine association score, which is a limitation of this method, by calculating the Z-score of significance. Initially, it seems like they calculate the Z-scores of cosine values. However, upon examining the script available on GitHub, it becomes evident that they actually calculate the Z-score of the distance between two TFs. The assessment of the normality of the distance distribution is also performed. Unfortunately, the publication does not emphasize this important aspect of the algorithm. Another noteworthy aspect is related to Figure 2.A. It is observed that the number of co-occurring pairs differs across cell types, which raises intriguing questions. Is this variation primarily influenced by biological factors or technical factors? Is this variation an expected outcome? Or does it correlate with the number of peaks present in the CHIP-seq data utilized for validation?",2023-07-06T13:37:54,liudmylakondratova,Liudmyla Kondratova,10.1101/2022.06.21.496953,TF-COMB - discovering grammar of transcription factor binding sites,"Mette Bentsen, Vanessa Heger, Hendrik Schultheis, Carsten Kuenne, Mario Looso",2022-06-22

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.04.547574v1#comment-6224740504,biorxivstage,1,"This is a well written and clear manuscript comparing successful and defective heart regeneration in zebrafish versus medaka, respectively. The experiments are well designed and the interpretation is careful and thorough. These kinds of studies are essential and, now powered by single cell sequencing, can cast wide nets that enable unbiased description and investigation of this process. As clearly stated by the authors, the description provided here undoubtedly provides numerous follow-ups, questions, and hypotheses about regenerative success and failure. The authors should also be commended on creating a webtool to allow others’ to query their dataset. “Cross-species data integration was effective as both zebrafish and medaka cells were represented in each major cluster”. Agreed that across the major clusters there is good agreement. I’m more curious about if this is potentially overfitting–are you losing a different cluster only present in one species? From published data, could we expect any different clusters between these two species? (addressed a bit later on with zEP cells). In general, it may be worth exploring a couple other strategies for cross species integration to try and prove this further (point 6 also addresses this). The scale of the interferon-deficiency in the medaka is striking. It’s mentioned that DAMPs from necrotic cells could be a driver of interferon responses, but building on some of your prior work (Balla et al. 2020 PMID: 32413307), are the zebrafish all harboring some virus at this point and the medaka not? Could a viral/microbiome-related reason result in lack of IFN signaling. Relatedly, it would be interesting to see if medaka have type IV interferons ( https://www.nature.com/arti... (and if these are included in this one-to-one comparisons/ if they are even annotated in the current version of the zebrafish genome). Finally, is there evidence of any DAMP response? For example, are there still other chemokines and cytokines (potenitlaly NFkB nuclear translocation) being produced in medaka and just specifically not an IFN signature? This is getting at the question of whether this is specifically lack of IFN signaling or if medaka are hyporesponse to, for example, DAMPs. Is recruitment responsible for increased macrophages in zebrafish or is it expansion of tissue resident cells? This could affect the conclusion drawn in medaka that they are not recruiting macrophages. Figure 3H, the proportion of TNFa positive cells is reported, but what about the absolute number? Given the relatively higher numbers of macrophages in the zebrafish it would be interesting to see how these compare. The ratio of pro versus anti-inflammatory macrophages could be an interesting metric to report. Do the zebrafish ever mount a substantial pro-inflammatory response? It’s suggested that highly regenerative animals undergo a quick switch from pro- to anti-inflammatory and this is important for regeneration, but data demonstrating that is sparse at best and the question remains if there is ever robust a pro-inflammatory response in regenerative animals. Paragraph starting with “We know relatively little about the makeup..” is a bit unclear. What type of cells are you referring to? Are these the fibroblast-like cells or fibroblasts? The concluding sentence leads one to believe fibroblasts are benign studied, but earlier on it’s discussed that “epicardial cells cells expressing collagens”. Do you find collagen expression by macrophages? ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.... Are mmp15/16 implicated in regeneration? Regarding the zEP cells and their potential uniqueness to zebrafish, it would be interesting to explore a samap or other tools and see if they still remain separate ( https://github.com/atarasha..., https://www.biorxiv.org/con..., note: this paper integrates zebrafish heart single cell data with 4 other species and could be worth looking at). As noted by the authors, more work is needed here. Whole mount FISH of hearts from both zebrafish and medaka would be quite interesting to see if zEPs can be detected anywhere. The mammalian studies are interesting and could be worth expanding. It would be insightful to tie back into the first few figures and the major findings there. Can you learn anything new from the mouse dataset with the perspectives gleaned from the fish comparison? For example, what is happening with the ISGs in the mouse? It could also be interesting to compare to salamander heart regeneration to provide another evolutionary intermediate ( https://www.nature.com/arti... Do primordial cardiomyocytes wane with age? Do larval/developing medaka contain these cells and do these young medaka regenerate their hearts? (perhaps not experimentally feasible). What is the role for the compact myocardium when not in regeneration? Why is there so much diversity in its size across species? Do you think there is a unifying reason for lack of regeneration in medaka? You uncover quite a few differences. Minor stuff: This is a biased comment, but it would be really interesting to know if there is divergence between replicates. You could pull out each sample with some genotype-based demuxing. Check out: https://www.life-science-al.... This might also aid with DE analysis ( https://www.nature.com/arti... “To investigate the contributions of epicardial-derived cells to the fibrotic response, we re-clustered all cells expressing epicardial-specific markers tcf21 and tbx18, and re-clustered them into four…” a bit confusing with double re-clustering here. Do medaka lack cortical cardiomyocytes or are they just less abundant? The last line of the figure 6 results section suggests an absence with the use of “lack”. One could consider side-by-side violins might better illustrate between time point comparisons. Figure 6E and G with numbers for cluster labels is not super clear. Perhaps these could be labeled with the top markers they express or more info added to figure legend to explain. Including on the figure the species for E-F and G-H could also help orient readers more quickly.",2023-07-06T11:17:24,nick_leigh,Nick Leigh,10.1101/2023.07.04.547574,Distinct features of the regenerating heart uncovered through comparative single-cell profiling,"Clayton M.

However, this study provides more evidence for the existence of the polar filter. When there is reduced interaction between N828 and the phosphate moiety of the incoming nucleotide, the rNTP can move slightly such that the 2'-OH will no longer clash with the steric filter. If there is proper interaction between N828 and the phosphate moiety, then it is not possible for the rNTP to move to neutralize the steric filter. The Asn residue is conserved in other B-family DNA polymerases and all the available crystal structures show the presence of the interaction between the conserved Asn and the phosphate moiety. The  M644 residue is present below the triphosphate moiety. The observation that the M644G mutation leads to reduction in the interaction of N828 with the phosphate moiety of the incoming nucleotide is very interesting because the C-beta atoms of the two residues M644 and N828 are located about 9 Angstroms from each other.",2023-07-06T08:56:03,disqus_m8BBtWtL3O,Deepak Nair,10.1101/2023.07.01.547322,A sensor complements the steric gate when DNA polymerase ε discriminates ribonucleotides,"Vimal Parkash, Yashraj Kulkarni, Göran O.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.27.546055v1#comment-6220777788,biorxivstage,1,"I have some comments, however, on the phrasing of your definition of a cell type. The phrase I am concerned about is ""We propose that a cell type should be robust to inter-individual variation, and therefore defined as a group of cells that are more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain."" There is also a very similar variation to it in Fig. 6 that shares the same difficulties: ""Cell type is defined as a group of neurons which is more similar to a group in another brain than to anything in the same brain"" It is repeated with variations once more further in the text with the same problems: ""To address these complex typing issues we employ a new definition of cell type that uses inter-animal variability to determine when cell types should be split: A cell type is a group of neurons that is more similar to a group of neurons in another brain than to any other neuron in the same brain"" 1. It is also not clear if you are stating how ""cell type"", the idea, should be defined, or how different cell types should be delimited. Are you defining the concept of ""cell type""? Or are you suggesting a methodology for identifying cells of the same type in practice? A subtle, but very important distinction. 2. It is also important to notice that this is not a general definition of ""cell type"", as it is scoped to Drosophila melanogaster brain connectomes. This is obvious from context but needs to be explicit for it to be a precise definition. . A definition that says ""A cell type is a group of neurons"" excludes all non-neuronal cells and is incompatible with the use of ""cell type"" for all other non-neuronal cells. You would be more precise by saying ""A neuronal cell type is a group of neurons"". Also, not all neurons are in brains, so the definition also needs to make that clear. 3. Going pedantic at ""A group of cells that are more similar to cells in a different brain"" -- The beggining of the sentence seems to refer to ALL brains, and then it says that this group is more similar to cells in a DIFFERENT brain. These similar cells in the DIFFERENT brain are NOT part of the group? Are cell types restricted to single brains? Some rephrashings that  try and prevent that paradox, and could be what the authors mean, would be: ""A group of cells that are are more similar to each other, even among different individuals,  than they are to other cells in the same individual."" Or even: ""For any individual, each cell type is defined as a group of cells that are more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain."" 3. The definition needs a quantifiable similarity metric. In the case of the study, it seems to be based on patterns of connectivity and morphology. It does, however, brings up the question: what about other kinds of similarity? Are they less useful? In terms of genome content (e.g. SNPs), they will be always more similar to cells in the same individual. Does the existence of different cell types depend on the similarity metric used? Is this a contextualized, procedural definition? These should be clear, otherwise the definition is overstating and might bring up confusion. The algorithmic implementation you present is very data-dependent, as it considers it mandatory presence of the type in each of the 3 individual hemispheres 4. The looseness of the ""similarity"" ends up including cell states and other extraneous groups of cells. E.g. ""apoptotic cells"" are more similar to each other than to others, or ""cycling cells"" or even very artificial cell types such as ""big neurons"", whose size will be more similar to each other than cells in other brains. You implement a particular, and complex, system based on connectivity and morphology, but these details are not part of your definition. 5. You don't make it clear if the the definition is restricted to a species or is a larger definition of cell type across nature. The different brains you mention are only in Drosophila? Or a particular species of Drosophila? A particular strain? If just a strain contains a set of cells with a particular connectivipy pattern, but other strains don't, do you _really_ want to call it a cell type? To sum up, these notes intend on bringing up the subtleties in defining the concept of ""cell type"". To make it less ambiguous one possible phrasing would be: ""We propose that cell types should be robust to inter-individual variation. Cells of the same type should be more similar to each other then to other cells. For our Fly Brain Cell Atlas, each cell type corresponds to a set of Drosophila brain neurons that are, by connectivity, more similar to neurons in other individuals then to other cells in the same brain."" If you want to talk about the concept of cell type, using some formal ontology vocabulary,  you could say that: ""We define the concept of ""cell type"" as a group of cells for which any two cells share a similar connectivity and morphology, to a higher extent then to any other cell outside the group."" In this way, you include cells of different individuals under the same cell type umbrella, without ambiguity. Of course, then you need to define what you mean by a ""similar connectivity pattern"". It is very weird that you say that  ""A cell type is a falsifiable hypothesis about biological variability within and across animals34"", AND that you tested such hypothesis, because that is not what you do in your system. You have data-driven neuron types, with identifiable individuals across 3 datasets. Now they may form each a falsifiable hypothesis. Which hypothesis is that? How can one falsify it? That is unclear, and unless you specify it, unadressable. You mention that ""Crucially, this resource includes 4,179 cell types of which 3,166 consensus cell types are robustly defined by comparison with a second dataset, the “hemibrain” connectome3"" So, if your analysis FALSIFIED the hypothesis, you should not even mention the ~1000 cell types that were FALSIFIED. You are not using the hypothetico-deductive method, and the ""falsifiable hypothesis"" system is not fit for your work, as it is data-driven, iterative and induction-based (and not deduction-based), without random sampling and a low N. However, it is an excelent work! You just cannot say your resource is different becaus it treats cell types as  falsifiable hypothesis to be tested, and then not rejecting in the light of falsification. The work is, of course, solid science and adds much to the state of the art. The theoretical formulations are still not at the same quality of the analysis pipelines and experiments. I hope at least some of these comments will be useful, with the goal of refining definitions of cell type for increased precision and usefulness.

We’d like to share a few of our thoughts and comments with you. We thought this was a really wonderful paper. One of the things that we found really exciting and novel was that you were not able to identify one characteristic that confers pathogenicity to banana (in contrast to e.g. tomato pathogenicity that can be traced back to chromosome 14 of Fol4287). This suggests either that a unifying characteristic does not exist for banana pathogens or that it is perhaps broken up into different components of the disease - e.g. a specific thing that causes browning, another that causes softening, etc which may be controlled by different genes, potentially harboured within different ARs. We thought that this was a message that you could state more clearly in the paper and in your abstract. Given the title of your manuscript, we interpreted that the message you chose as your selling point for the paper was the issue of segmental duplications and their role in evolution. We felt that we lacked the necessary background information to understand the significance of this. It would be really helpful to have some information on gene duplications in the introduction. From Fig. 6e, we could tell that segmental duplications were something unique to Fol4827, but it was unclear on how significant this is as opposed to having another type of duplication. For example: why are segmental duplications particularly important in evolution and/or why was it a surprise that they were involved. Fig. 6a gave a good explanation of the basic differences between the duplication types but (1) we felt that information would be useful earlier in the paper and (2) a written explanation would complement the figure nicely. Another query that came up was related to the RNA data from 8 days post inoculation. It is not clear in the methods which strains were used to infect the Cavendish bananas or which strains were inoculated onto the PDA medium prior to RNA extraction. Given that different races are distinguished by their pathogenicity on different subsets of banana varieties, we wondered if there are any implications for the RNA-seq results? I.e. if strains were used that are not usually found infecting the type of Cavendish used for inoculation in this study, would the RNA expression results possibly be impacted? The figures in the paper were informative and conveyed the data well. However some of the multi-panel figures were not always intuitive to read. For example, Figure 6 c,d and e are intended to be read together, which you can figure out by reading the legend, but a visual cue such as some background shading or a box would improve the readability. Similarly, the background shading in Fig. 1 that links panel d to the earlier panels wasn’t noticed by most of us (only 1 member picked it up) so it may be worth making that clearer. Overall we found this to be a really well executed study and we all thoroughly enjoyed reading and discussing it.",2023-06-30T09:31:40,disqus_t6NaQ1tN5H,Chanel Thomas,10.1101/2023.06.07.544053,Segmental Duplications Drive the Evolution of Accessory Regions in a Major Crop Pathogen,"A.C. van Westerhoven, C.

I thought that the video from this Tweet was very helpful in helping me read through the preprint more carefully: https://twitter.com/Gencove... This preprint covers some important topics, and I hope that this comment system can help myself as well as others. When you are able to do so, I would very much appreciate if you could provide feedback on the following questions/comments: General Points : 1) I am sure that there are additional ways to make ancestry assignments, but I am not sure if it might help to have some way to indicate a possibility of ""unclear"" ancestry? As one possible option, running unsupervised ADMIXTURE with k greater than 6 would match what I thought helped when trying to estimate ancestry for my pet cat: PDF for Re-Analysis of Raw Domestic Cat Data If I understand correctly, then I am not sure if that might help reduce small fractions of unexpected ancestry in the tigers? Also, as a minor point, I created that report a while ago.  I understand that ""regular"" coverage for Whole Genome Sequencing costs much less now, even if ordered from the same company. 2) Am I correctly understanding that a custom strategy with 106 tiger reference genomes is being used for the imputations? In the Supplemental Excel file, I see an “Unimputed” category.  There are more than 106 “Unimputed” rows, but there are 32 rows for “Liu et al. 2018” and 64 samples listed as either “Armstrong et al. 2020” or “Armstrong et al. 2022”.  That 96 instead of 106, but does that mean that GEN1, SRR836354, and SRR7651465 are “Generic” tigers that were not used for imputation training?  Even though the coverage depth was >20x, SRR836354 and SRR7651465 are listed in the “Imputed” category (in the Supplemental Excel File). Given some drop in raw accuracy for my cat data versus human data (in the link from my second comment on Twitter), I thought it might be worth raising a question (especially if tiger variation is less well understood than domestic cat variation). As long as some samples are independent of training, I think that the conclusion can be OK. For example, even if the individual variant error rate was 15% or higher (to be less accurate than my cat's Gencove imputations), then maybe that is OK across a long enough segment (or the whole genome).  However, if I understand correctly, then I think the results for 5594-DP-0001_S3 (as well as the single-ancestry “Unimputed” samples) could potentially be over-fit?  If that is correct, then perhaps adding a designation for “training” and “validation” samples within the plot (or the description) might be OK? Also, strictly speaking, the reference in the main text was “Armstrong et al. 2021” (versus “Armstrong et al. 2020” or “Armstrong et al. 2022”).  However, if I am understanding correctly, then I think that could be a minor update. 3) I am sure that there are better ways to estimate local ancestry, relative to what I did with my cat and some public SNP chip data.  However, with a somewhat limited number of SNPs, I encountered some issues in getting accurate RFMix local ancestry estimates for ""Western"" versus ""Eastern"" ancestry. If I understand correctly, then I believe something different being used for global ancestry.  For example, Figure 1A describes providing supervised ADMIXTURE results, and I see a citation for the Alexander et al. 2009 ADMIXTURE publication (in the Supplemental Methods). So, as far as I can tell, I think this is OK. In other words, I apologize if I am missing something important.  However, can you please help explain the parts of the results that are influenced by RFMix estimates (and if there are results in this publication to show better performance than I saw for my pet cat)? Specific (Probably Minor) Points : a)"" variant calling was subsequently performed by Gencove using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v4.1.4.1"" I uploaded FASTQ files for running Gencove on samples for genomics data myself and my cat.  Is there something different that was done for the tiger samples? In general, I would not expect that GATK was used for variant calling (by the lab or collaborator), if Gencove was used for imputation. Did Gencove also assist with “regular” coverage variant calling, and/or is there might be anything else that I am misunderstanding? b) I was not able to access https://github.com/jaam92/T... Perhaps this repository needs to be made public?  I could access https://github.com/jaam92. c) Minor Typo: Current : Data associated with this stud has been deposited into bioproject number Corrected : Data associated with this stud y has been deposited into bioproject number Again, thank you very much for posting this preprint!

Using Number & Brightness (N&B) analysis, they investigate the oligomeric state of MR in the presence of different ligands and mutations/truncations to identify what controls different oligomeric states. While they comparisons they performed between different ligands and constructs of MR show qualitative differences, this paper is missing some key controls, particularly in the localization of the nucleus and MMTV array, which prevent us from thoroughly assessing the paper. Major Comments: 1) Provide details and controls on identifying the nucleus versus cytoplasmic versus DNA binding/MMTV array. Only labeling these with the molecule of interest (MR) is inappropriate. To assess if MR is congregating at the MMTV or some other location in the nucleus, the MMTV array must be labeled with something other than GFP, allowing simultaneous visualization of the array and the MR oligomerization state. 2) Explain the varying oligomerization states you observe across your dataset. Can you provide ranges of oligomerization states across your results? How should we interpret mixed populations? What were your criteria to decide whether a construct dimerizes, oligomerizes etc. 3) The manuscript has varying points for each condition (for example, in Figure 1B, there are 490 single cells for one condition, with 36 single cells for another condition). Please explain why there is so much variety in the number of data points. Minor Comments: 1) The introduction could be improved by expanding on details on the transcriptional crosstalk of MR/GR and the observations of GR at MMTV (and clarify this is the data the rest of this paper is compared to). 2) Please clarify the construct of the cell line and if endogenous MR is knocked out. 3) In Fig. 4 C, the MR-N579/GC-470C mutant array displays only 11 data points, while the figure legend says it contains 22. 4) The figures with agonist or antagonist would be clearer if the agonist or antagonists were labeled. 5) In the section ‘MR and GR do not share the same dimerization interfaces’. Please provide some context for the D-loop and P-loop.

In particular, the major areas for focus in the full LCA are as follows: There is likely no market for cultivated meat produced with pharma-grade ingredients, and the value of modeling production in this way is dubious. Accordingly, the “PF” scenarios in the LCA should be excluded as they are highly misleading. These scenarios do not reflect “near-term” cultivated meat production, there is no requirement for pharma-grade ingredients or specifications to successfully grow animal cells, the justification based on concern for endotoxin is not sound, and it is highly questionable whether the proxy study used to estimate the environmental impact of pharma-grade purification is representative of cell culture media production. The GCR scenario should be excluded because even lab-scale data using non-optimized cell lines are far more (about 3x) efficient. The AAR and HGM scenarios are still useful and aligned with estimates from other published studies. Because of these issues, the overall conclusions should be reconsidered. The analyses should be redone with scenarios that model near-term cultivated meat production based on current practices and the best available information.",2023-06-21T00:46:58,elliotswartz,Elliot Swartz,10.1101/2023.04.21.537778,Environmental impacts of cultured meat: A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment,"Derrick Risner, Yoonbin Kim, Cuong Nguyen, Justin B.

There is a lack of discussion of more recent LCA studies a) The paper has an entire section of its introduction called “The limitations of existing ACBM LCAs,” but this section does not actually mention any of the more recent LCA studies, which are briefly described below and also referred to throughout this document. In fact, none of these studies are cited at all in either of the papers. Notably, the conclusions (but not necessarily all underlying findings) in this paper — particularly the “PF” scenarios based on flawed assumptions — deviate significantly from every peer-reviewed study published to date. Tuomisto, 2022: This study uses bench-scale data and non-optimized cell lines and media to examine environmental impacts when cells are grown in hollow fiber bioreactors. This study is informative for understanding how some aspects of cultivated meat production may look today in early-stage startups. Kim, 2022: This study uses primary lab-scale and pilot-scale data from cultivated meat manufacturer SciFi Foods to examine the environmental impact of their hybrid beef burger. Sinke, 2023: This study uses data from over 15 different companies involved in the manufacturing and supply chain of cultivated meat to examine environmental impacts when cells are grown at a scale of 10,000 metric tons annually, set in the year 2030. This study is informative for understanding what cultivated meat production is anticipated to look like when it reaches commercial scale at the end of this decade. 3. The study does not model near-term cultivated meat production a) The study claims to model “near-term” cultivated meat production, and this is used as a major justification for the inclusion of pharmaceutical-grade media scenarios. No definition of “near-term” is provided. Does “near-term” mean 3 years? 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? The production model used in the study is based on Humbird’s techno-economic analysis (Humbird, 2021), which models cell growth in 20,000L bioreactors in a facility that outputs nearly 7,000 metric tons of meat per year. Additionally, the Humbird analysis assumes a market size of 100,000 tons of annual cultivated meat production. The cultivated meat industry is not operating at these scales today or in the next several years and thus it is difficult to reconcile how the study models “near-term” cultivated meat production. This seems to be a case of trying to have your cake and eat it too. b) The Humbird analysis has higher energy use compared to other studies (i.e., Sinke, 2023) due to differing assumptions surrounding cleanroom infrastructure, and a discussion of these differences in the context of actual or anticipated practices in the cultivated meat industry is warranted. 4. Lack of any other comparison to conventional beef besides carbon footprint and fossil fuel depletion. a) How does cultivated meat compare to conventional beef on other environmental indicators? Table 2 contains 10 different environmental metrics for cultivated meat, yet only two are discussed in the text of the paper, and none of the other corresponding metrics are listed for conventional beef. Why is this information and discussion omitted? b) “Environmental impact” is discussed throughout the text of the paper, but in reality, only carbon footprints or fossil fuel depletion is discussed. Environmental impact is much more than emissions. The text of the paper should be changed to reflect the actual comparisons being made.",2023-06-21T00:46:35,elliotswartz,Elliot Swartz,10.1101/2023.04.21.537778,Environmental impacts of cultured meat: A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment,"Derrick Risner, Yoonbin Kim, Cuong Nguyen, Justin B.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.21.537778v1#comment-6213036071,biorxivstage,1,"There are several issues with this pre-print study, described below: 1. Media use calculations are not aligned with other studies, resulting in inefficient scenarios modeled for production a) As discussed in comments on your other manuscript ( https://www.biorxiv.org/con..., the amount/concentration of ingredients in Essential 8 is not optimized for cultivated meat production, and no companies would go to market using this off-the-shelf formulation. The consequences of assuming that Essential 8 would be used in the GCR and AAR scenarios in this study result in extremely poor yields of 0.87 to 3.43 grams of biomass per liter of media, corresponding to 292 liters to 1,148 liters of media per kilogram of meat (GCR to AAR scenarios, respectively). As discussed below, these scenarios represent very inefficient baselines from which to model. Despite the AAR scenario being inefficient, the carbon footprint of 19.2 kg CO2eq/kg of meat is still 68% lower than the median carbon footprint of conventional retail beef (listed as 60 kg CO2eq/kg in this study). Indeed, the entire results section is misleading as it frames the findings as comparing worst-case and unrealistic scenarios for cultivated meat to best-case scenarios for conventional beef. The last sentence of the abstract states, “The results indicate that the environmental impact of near-term ACBM production is likely to be orders of magnitude higher than median beef production if a highly refined growth medium is utilized for ACBM production.” As I’ve described above in comments on your other manuscript, the highly refined growth medium scenario is reflective of an academic exercise, not near-term cultivated meat production. The results actually indicate that models of inefficient cultivated meat production still have significantly lower carbon footprints than median conventional beef production. b) To further illustrate this inefficiency, we can compare the scenarios in this study to other published studies, as shown in Table D.9 from Sinke, 2023, which also contains the enhanced catabolism scenario from Humbird, 2021 — similar to the HGM scenario in this study (the difference being the amino acids sourced from hydrolysates as opposed to fermentation). We can then add the GCR and AAR scenarios from this study in this same format (based on the DMEM/F12 formulation containing glutamine), along with another study by your colleagues at UC Davis, O’Neill, 2023, which models an off-the-shelf mouse myoblast cell line called C2C12, the same cell line used in the CMB scenario above from Tuomisto, 2022.

It is highly questionable if such a scenario is even warranted for inclusion in the study, given that it requires 3 times as many amino acids and sugars to create 1 kg of meat compared to estimates from non-optimized, off-the-shelf cell lines. Despite this, at a carbon footprint of 75.4 kg CO2eq/kg of meat, it is still only 25% higher than median conventional beef production and far lower than the worst forms of beef production.",2023-06-21T00:44:27,elliotswartz,Elliot Swartz,10.1101/2023.04.21.537778,Environmental impacts of cultured meat: A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment,"Derrick Risner, Yoonbin Kim, Cuong Nguyen, Justin B.

It should be removed from the analysis as it will not be included in cell culture media for cultivated meat production. Furthermore, bioreactors are equipped with pH sensors, negating the need for a pH indicator in the media. 2. Sinke, 2023 uses naphthalene sulfonic acid as a proxy for HEPES, which may also be considered for use in your model. 3. Modeling the incorporation of antibiotics into the cell culture media is illustrative of how much of an environmental burden such a choice would carry. In this regard, its inclusion in this study is useful. But it is misleading to present the use of antibiotics in Beefy-9 as the default, as this is not relevant to cultivated meat media that will actually be used in production. Beefy-9 contains antibiotics because the experiments in the corresponding paper (Stout, 2022) are performed in plastic dishes, which do not have the same degree of sterility control as a bioreactor. The manuscript fails to mention that antibiotics are not anticipated to be used for the production of cultivated meat, which is a major benefit of this way of meat production (McNamara & Bomkamp, 2022). There are two products from two companies in the United States that have received FDA clearance as well as multiple products from a single company that have been approved for sale in Singapore. None of these products are produced using antibiotics in the manufacturing process (only small amounts of antibiotics may be used during biopsy and initial cell isolation).",2023-06-21T00:35:48,elliotswartz,Elliot Swartz,10.1101/2023.04.21.537772,Cradle to production gate life cycle assessment of cultured meat growth media: A comparison of Essential 8™ and Beefy-9,"Derrick Risner, Patrick Negulescu, Yoonbin Kim, Cuong Nguyen, Justin B.

The use of Wernet, 2010 is not an accurate proxy for the environmental impact of cell culture media ingredients. a) The study by Wernet et al is the basis for a 20x multiplication factor applied in various scenarios “to account for additional processing associated with active pharmaceutical ingredient production.” This study looks at a 12-step chemical synthesis process to develop an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The relevance of this synthesis process to the majority of ingredients in Essential 8 is unclear, and the justification for using this study as a proxy for a single media ingredient (let alone all of them in the worst-case scenario in the full LCA) is not adequately explained. Furthermore, the energy mix used in this study as well as the actual purification processes used are not clear, making it even more difficult to assess its relevance to cell culture media and cultivated meat production. Overall, the environmental metrics for pharmaceutical products are very scarce, and information about processing steps is difficult to obtain. A similar problem currently exists in the cultivated meat industry, hence the impetus for this research. A discussion of these limitations, especially in the context of selecting this single study as a proxy for the refinement of cell culture media ingredients, is warranted. b) According to data we collected based on pharmaceutical-grade production of recombinant proteins produced in microbes (Sinke, 2023), downstream processing and purification make up about 33-50% of total facility energy use. Following your approach, this would lead to a factor of added energy use of 2x. A single data point can thus lead to a completely different model. This introduces great uncertainty and ignores the variety in upstream and downstream processing options leading to different environmental results. c) In the Wernet 2010 study, it is stated that 65-85% of the impacts are energy-related (Fig 3). Given that this study was published 13 years ago and energy mixes have changed, this study is likely an overestimate of the actual impact of the production of the same API today or in the future, as the grid continues to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. What would the impact be if predominantly renewable energy was used? 4. Applicability of Essential 8 to cultivated meat production a) In an article published in Thin Ink, it is stated, “He [Derrick Risner] also said they used E8 growth medium because that was identified by GFI as a growth medium which could be scaled.” It is important to clarify that the media cost analysis published by GFI uses Essential 8 because it is a serum-free media formulation with a publicly-available composition. It is not stated in the analysis and should not be assumed that Essential 8 would be used for cultivated meat production. Rather, as described in Sinke et al 2023, the cell culture media composition will be based on the needs of the cells and is expected to deviate from commercially-available formulations designed for other purposes. Indeed, even the DMEM/F12 basal media formulation used in Essential 8 has been shown to contain ingredients that are nonessential or at suboptimal concentrations for pluripotent stem cell culture (Lyra-Leite, 2023). No cultivated meat companies are going to market using off-the-shelf Essential 8 or other common formulations. The decision to model Essential 8 with an off-the-shelf composition leads to inaccuracies in the downstream environmental impact model for cultivated meat production (discussed further in (B) below). 5. Missing information related to energy use and media use calculations a. Assumptions for energy mixes used in the study are not stated. More information is needed to validate the calculations presented in the study.",2023-06-21T00:34:40,elliotswartz,Elliot Swartz,10.1101/2023.04.21.537772,Cradle to production gate life cycle assessment of cultured meat growth media: A comparison of Essential 8™ and Beefy-9,"Derrick Risner, Patrick Negulescu, Yoonbin Kim, Cuong Nguyen, Justin B.

The concern over endotoxin contamination is exaggerated. a) Several cell culture media suppliers I spoke with were puzzled by the focus on endotoxin removal as a challenge and why this concern over endotoxin was being used as a justification for including the [pharmaceutical-grade] purification factor (PF) scenarios in the full LCA. First, it is important to clarify to the reader that endotoxin is not primarily a food safety concern, as the end product is ingested rather than injected into the bloodstream. Concern for endotoxin in the context of cultivated meat is therefore related to cell culture performance rather than the safety of the end product. b) Different cell lines and cell types are affected by endotoxin differently. As stated in the research papers cited in the study, “endotoxins do not act directly against cells or organs but through activation of the immune system, especially the monocytes and macrophages, thereby enhancing immune responses (Magalhães, 2007).” Accordingly, cell lines that are not derived from the immune system have been shown to tolerate much higher levels of endotoxin. For example, multiple cell lines, including widely used cells such as 3T3 and CHO, displayed no detectable effects on cell growth with endotoxin levels as high as 20 ng/mL (Epstein, 1990). These concentrations are far higher than the specifications for pharmaceuticals, which are measured on picogram scales — hence, using pharmaceutical-grade purification processes to meet pharmaceutical specifications for endotoxin removal is not a requirement for successful animal cell culture. This is especially true in cultivated meat, where the cells are not derived from the immune system. c) There are many ways to reduce endotoxin in the raw materials used for media production, but the simplest way is by seeking out raw materials that are low in endotoxin to begin with. This is standard practice for many key basal media ingredients such as glucose, salts, and trace elements. Furthermore, each raw material coming from a supplier is routinely tested for endotoxins as part of established quality management systems and the final milled dry powder media production batch can be tested upon request before it is released to the customer. d) Endotoxin removal is a byproduct of many purification processes, as the pre-print mentions. Ultrafiltration is often used in the production of materials such as hydrolysates, amino acids, and proteins, but ultrafiltration is not a requirement for cell performance. Nonultrafiltered hydrolysates have been shown to perform just as well as ultrafiltered ones. As stated in the study, “​​low endotoxin levels were detected in all hydrolysate samples that were used for testing, suggesting that ultrafiltration is not necessary as an endotoxin risk-mitigating activity.” It is true that in today’s cultivated meat industry, many amino acids are supplied via individual microbial fermentation processes that could carry endotoxins. However, these amino acids are commonly being sourced at food-grade specifications today where they have not displayed issues with cell viability (see #1.a.iv above), and there is a strong push to develop media supply chains where the primary source of amino acids (and other vitamins and trace elements) are derived from hydrolysates that inherently contain lower amounts of endotoxin than amino acids produced in bacteria. e) Overall, it is unclear if the concerns regarding endotoxin relate to the raw materials themselves or to bottlenecks in the preparation of complete media, which may include various processing, filtration, and finishing steps. Could this be clarified? For example, for the former concern, a single raw material may be high in endotoxin, but by the time it is processed and combined with many other ingredients, endotoxin levels can be substantially diluted. Therefore, concern over endotoxin in raw materials has to be taken in the context of that specific raw material’s concentration in the finished media. For the latter concern, many methods of filtration are available for use, and similarly to other industries (e.g., beer, wine), fit-for-purpose filtration technology and SOPs that balance the needs of the cultivated meat industry (e.g., cost, safety, performance) will be established with time. f) The justification for modeling TGFb production in CHO cells to avoid endotoxin is also questionable. There is a large negative incentive to manufacture proteins in animal cells, which is far more costly than microbial systems. While it is true that much of today’s TGFb supply is produced in animal cells, it is also true that microbially-produced TGFb is sold today with low enough endotoxin levels to support cultivated meat companies and others performing animal cell cultures. Companies working on producing recombinant proteins in plants with no endotoxins are also planning to manufacture TGFb. Thus, researchers and companies can source microbially-produced TGFb with low endotoxin today, and the supply of TGFb manufactured in non-animal cells will only increase in the future.",2023-06-21T00:32:40,elliotswartz,Elliot Swartz,10.1101/2023.04.21.537772,Cradle to production gate life cycle assessment of cultured meat growth media: A comparison of Essential 8™ and Beefy-9,"Derrick Risner, Patrick Negulescu, Yoonbin Kim, Cuong Nguyen, Justin B.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.21.537772v1#comment-6213028907,biorxivstage,0,"There are several issues with this pre-print manuscript, listed below: 1) Assumptions about pharmaceutical-grade media do not align with reality. The manuscripts as well as quotes in the press come off as authoritative on the use of pharmaceutical-grade media in the cultivated meat industry, but it’s unclear where this authoritativeness is derived from. For example, in New Scientist: “This “pharmaceutical-grade” level of purification is required so that there are no contaminants such as bacteria or their associated toxins in the broth, says Risner” a) The DMEM/F12 carbon footprint calculated in this study (0.062 kg CO2eq per liter) is only 8% higher than the carbon footprint of DMEM/F12 when back-calculating from the environmental impact of basal medium ingredients used in another model (personal communication with the co-authors of Sinke, 2023). Given this small difference in modeling of the complex basal media, almost all of the difference in the overall results of the study compared to Sinke, 2023 is due to applying an unnecessary 20x factor to these ingredients (discussed in #3 below), which is claimed to represent the impact of additional purification required for more refined pharma-grade media ingredients. b) The overall model for Essential 8 is still useful for the field, as LCA database inventories for cell culture media ingredients are currently incomplete. c) Although the focus of the study is not on costs, costs and feasibility must also be considered when modeling different scenarios that are portrayed as being representative. Previous techno-economic models (Vergeer, 2021), including your own (Risner, 2020), demonstrate that using pharmaceutical-grade media results in costs that are several orders of magnitude higher than conventional meat costs. It is simply not possible to bring cultivated meat to market using pharmaceutical-grade inputs. This is known by everyone in the industry, so attempting to portray this as a realistic scenario is neither accurate nor beneficial to the analysis. d) The UC Davis Cultivated Meat Consortium’s external advisory board contains 10 individuals including myself and several cultivated meat startups and input suppliers that would have been happy to discuss this topic with you. It is unclear why you did not reach out to advisory board members to assess the current practices of the industry and to ensure the accuracy of your assumptions. As a result, you’ve come to a conclusion — which is critical to the key findings — that does not represent the most recent science. e) Media input suppliers are sourcing and selling food-grade ingredients to cultivated meat manufacturers today. Food-grade materials are highly regulated and go through extensive testing by the raw material manufacturer/supplier with further validation at production/finishing facilities. They are often at the same or similar levels of purity as their pharma-grade counterparts (e.g., as in Kanayama, 2022) and thus are suitable for use in cell culture often with minimal differences in performance compared to pharma-grade counterparts. Food-grade amino acids are produced at scale by many large suppliers that are already plugged into the cultivated meat supply chain. As stated by Cellular Agriculture Europe, some companies are already using basal media that consists of 99% food-grade ingredients. Meatable has stated they are using media that is 70% food-grade. While some media components are still sourced pharma-grade, the statement, “At the moment, all cultivated meat is grown in pharmaceutical-grade nutrient broths,” which appeared in the original New Scientist article, is incorrect. f) In the paper, it is stated, “Utilization of commodity grade growth medium components such as glucose for animal cell growth is unlikely unless the components undergo an endotoxin separation process.” In fact, Nutreco has shown that feed-grade glucose can perform just as well in animal cell culture applications as pharma-grade glucose. g) If pharmaceutical-grade purification is required, how can this be reconciled with the numerous papers and other data points that show sufficient cell viability and growth in media that contain food-, fragrance-, or feed-grade ingredients, many of which are purified using simple protocols by students in a lab? Certainly, these studies weren’t meeting pharmaceutical specifications for all media ingredients. Non-exhaustive examples include: - Plant protein isolates used to replace animal albumins - Food-grade methylcellulose can enhance the performance of serum-free media - Media derived from algae and fermented okara - Fragrance-grade oleic acid used in cultivated chicken production - Integriculture’s food-grade basal media - Nutreco’s use of food-grade amino acids and feed-grade glucose - The ShojinMeat project growing cells in ingredients acquired from a grocery store",2023-06-21T00:30:40,elliotswartz,Elliot Swartz,10.1101/2023.04.21.537772,Cradle to production gate life cycle assessment of cultured meat growth media: A comparison of Essential 8™ and Beefy-9,"Derrick Risner, Patrick Negulescu, Yoonbin Kim, Cuong Nguyen, Justin B.

Comment on the discussion: While I agree with your point on exponential distributions (we make exactly this point ref. 36), the claim that one generally cannot fine-tune the variability of the cycle phase length with ODEs (p 15-16) is misleading. we do exactly that with our sub-steps approach (that you mention) which in fact permits the modulation of the cycle phase length variability from quasi invariable to exponential. It has actually been shown that mammalian cycle phase durations follow Erlang distributions (as they arise from our sub-steps). In our work, we estimate the coefficients of variations of the cycle phase length when identifiable from the data and discuss the information generally contained in this regard in our thymidine analogue incorporation experiments. Comments on the agent-based model: Minor comment (1)  EdU/BrdU incorporation. In my hands EdU is not immediately detectable in the thymus following injection (as is often assumed) and it takes more than 30 minutes to label all the cells in S phase (admittedly it was IP injection, and as you perform intravenous injection, labeling should be significantly faster). Here, if I understand correctly, you assume 0.5% of DNA being labeled is sufficient for detection which would label most cells after a couple of minutes in S phase when the analogue is present. Did you check this was the case (thymus collection 10 min after injection for instance)? You further assume that labeling stops abruptly after 45 minutes. However it does not seem plausible for incorporation to cease suddenly and a gradual decay of the analogue availability seems more realistic. Since you have time course data which can reduce the dependence of the result to the initial labeling phase, the effect of these assumptions might be very limited but it would still be useful to check to what extent these assumptions affect your result. (2) I found difficult to identify exactly what data you use for fitting (which is of course essential to judge the results) and how the data is assigned to your model, I think some clarifications would really be beneficial to the readers. Do you use exclusively EdU/BrdU information or do you combine this information with total DNA content (distribution of cells across the cell cycle)? Here is a point of particular concern: (3) I understand that you do not allow transition from cycling to ""long G1""/”quiescent”, sometimes finding these “long G1” cells represent >90% of a given population. Given the duration of each stage of thymic development (60 h for total DP for instance according to your 2017 review) it seems very unlikely that labeled cells do not contribute significantly to the quiescent subpopulations within 20 hours and in any case, this should certainly not be assumed a priori. From my own experience ignoring the cells transiting to quiescence/long G1 after the initial label incorporation might greatly distort your result by affecting the rate of entry in S phase. I expect the introduction of transition rate should improve your fit when a quiescent population is present (for later time points in particular) although I cannot conclude based on the data you currently present. In general, I find the exclusion of cells from the dynamics (which sometimes turn out to represent the overwhelming majority of the population) to be an extreme decision and I don’t think this should be made without strong evidence (simulations?) that this does not invalidate your result. (4) Along the same line, differentiation and transmission of labeled or unlabeled cells between compartments should be considered carefully. Differentiation can certainly affect percentages of labeled cells in a downstream compartment over time. While in some cases, the influx compared to local proliferation can be negligible (given the difference in size between compartments and respective cycling properties), it is a point which should be addressed for each cell compartment. If I understand correctly, your model poses that cells leaving a compartment are replaced exclusively by non-labeled cells. This is not neutral and, in some cases, may cast significant doubts on your predictions. For instance DN4 are directly downstream of the highly proliferative DN3b, and DN4 cells will be progressively replaced mostly by labeled cells as time goes on. At the very least, it should be discussed compartment by compartment why you think the assumption of exclusive influx of non-labeled cells holds given what is known of T cell development dynamics. While you have certainly built an important dataset, the manuscript at its current stage gives the impression that some essential features of the EdU/BrdU dynamics have been overlooked in the agent-based model. hope my comments will prove helpful.",2023-06-19T11:25:43,disqus_v2CCcS4nrO,Adrien Jolly,10.1101/2023.06.14.544919,High-resolution mapping of cell-cycle dynamics during steady-state T-cell development and regeneration in vivo,"Heike Kunze-Schumacher, Nikita A.

The overall flow of the paper, namely the shift from theoretical predictions to experimentation was a good segway into your web application. However, I did have some critiques, mostly regarding the figures. One general comment is that all schematics with red and green should be recolored for colorblind readers. Fig. 2a) Perhaps an overlay or neighboring graph showing what the expected CD specter for G4A4 RNA would be helpful to readers that this does in fact resemble what is expected. Fig. 2b) Indication of significance needed. Fig. 2c) This hierarchical clustering schematic should be much larger, and possibly contain a legend for interpreting the opacity of the colors. Fig. 2d) The label at the top is unnecessary and slightly misleading, and the labels at each axis should be larger. Fig. 3b,c) Pie charts should include percentages/quantities for all portions. Fig. 4d) Placement of p-value is confusing, perhaps place it over the area where the differences become significant. Fig. 5a) The x-axis labeling here is confusing. One solution could be to just put “neutral” and “very high,” or assign values to them, like “neutral” as 0 and “very high” as 1. I also noticed that your graph lines are closer towards the middle, however this could have been missed and should be made to appear more obvious to the reader. Fig. 5b, 6c) Color-coordinating the proteins listed in these figures based on classification/function would provide a richer understanding of the trends observed in G4 binding propensities. While this would interrupt the current color scheme in 5b, perhaps bold font would be sufficient to indicate controls. Fig. 6a,b) Data points are too clustered in these graphs; differently colored dots would probably work better.
