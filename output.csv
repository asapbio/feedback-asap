The paper shows that Desmodium releases volatiles, as we also demonstrate. However, it is quite apparent from their data that it does not do so constitutively: the various extracts that were used were highly variable in release rates, which is typical for induction. The high levels of green-leaf volatiles reported, which were absent in our samples, are also a telltale sign of damage. In the paper, maize also released some volatiles, indicating some above or below ground herbivore induction too. But, without the critical data on volatile release following controlled herbivore damage (i.e. a positive control) or internal standards, it is difficult to assess the results. In contrast, our carefully collected data shows that when unchallenged, neither Desmodium, nor maize release volatiles. We have analyzed hundreds of samples from various geographic locations (Sweden, Tanzania, Uganda, South Africa), from the greenhouse and the field, using different soils and microbial augmentations, using entrainments as well as SPME. All these samples, without exception, show that undamaged Desmodium does not release the reported ‘push’ volatiles constitutively (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes), while Melinis does constitutively release a diversity of terpenes in very large quantities. As we know, plants generally do not release volatiles constitutively. Some do, often through glandular trichomes (e.g. Melinis), which Desmodium lacks. Upon induction Desmodium indeed releases volatiles, but it is low compared to induced maize and Melinis. Between brackets, the above also shows that differences in methodology (SPME versus entrainments) can explain the differences between the studies, which was perhaps implied by Prof. Bruce’s comment. However, most significant is that our large number of field collections demonstrate that Desmodium rarely and minimally releases volatiles in the field, whereas maize releases substantial amounts and a large diversity. If Desmodium would be repellent, evidently maize would do a much better job. But indeed, our data also show that whole Desmodium plants did not repel S. frugiperda from ovipositing on maize at all. Our research provides the first experimental evidence that Desmodium does not constitutively release volatiles, and only minimally and unreliably in the field, where there may be herbivory. This is very different from what has been suggested over the last two decades (in the absence of data), and implies that the pest suppressive role of Desmodium is due to other mechanisms. We provide such an alternative mechanism: Desmodium is a catch crop that truncates larval development and kills insects. Such observations have been made in the somewhat grey literature data, with even vertebrates found to be captured by Desmodium. Obviously, how the mechanism exactly plays out in the field under various conditions needs further detailed field studies. Knowing the exact mechanisms of pest suppression is critical to further improve the maize intercropping system, and to rationally translate the urgently needed sustainable pest suppressive intercropping methods in other cropping systems. We are keen on researching the interplay of mechanisms together.

I quickly glanced through your manuscript and am intrigued by supplementary Figure 12. It looks to me that in some cell types Yap (transcript?) level correlates extraordinarily well with total transcript level (if I understood those panels correctly) whereas in others there is no correlation at all. This pattern is not seen with Myc or Mtor. I am wondering if these data suggest that the correlation between Yap and hypertranscription is selective for cell-type, whereas Mtor (and maybe Myc) is more generic. Furthermore, YAP protein activity/stability is highly regulated, which may also affected your analysis, which I assume is based on transcript levels. For the ChEA data analysis, I wonder whether YAP's preferential binding for enhancers (versus Myc for promoters) may have an effect on the result.",2022-03-24T22:51:01,xinweicao,Xinwei Cao,10.1101/2021.12.13.472426,Absolute Scaling of Single-Cell Transcriptomes Reveals Pervasive Hypertranscription in Adult Stem and Progenitor Cells,"Yun-Kyo Kim, Miguel Ramalho-Santos",2021-12-13

To think that worker bees and queen bees are not only distinct in their roles within the colony and their biology, but also display diverging gut microbiomes specific to the ecological niche to which it resides and thus a varying metabolism is quite fascinating. I do have some questions concerning quality control of your methods, though. What was the PCR target region, and how many PCR cycles were run? Minimizing the number of rounds of PCR reduces the sequencing error rate and fraction of chimeric sequences. I did see that you used universal primers to amplify the V4 region of the 16sRNA gene. Likewise, your methods section mentions quality filtering with VSEARCH, but other specifics are limited. I appreciate you considering both the dominant and rare taxa appropriately, and your handling and preparation of samples prior to DNA extraction was spot on. Further, OTU abundance was calculated by mapping the total quality-filtered paired reads to the final clusters, with the resulting abundances normalized by the total 16s rRNA gene copy numbers as estimated through qPCR, and differences in copy numbers across samples were evaluated with an aligned Rank Transformation of a Factorial Model with the R package ARTool. This method was explained well and is thorough. What about measuring sequencing coverage of the communities? Also, I did not see any mention of internal standards at the PCR step or the DNA extraction step. While I did see that resulting sequence reads were quality-trimmed, what was the total number of sequences obtained per sample and how many after quality filtering (and what criteria are used for quality filtering)?

What is the PCR target region, primers used, # of cycles? The PCR target region was V4 and 30 cycles were run. The primers used were never listed. The article also failed to provide the temperatures and duration of the cycles. 2. Does the bioinformatics method include steps to minimize PCR errors and chimeras? The “quality screening” in mothur should be explicit as to the filtering procedures. 3. Given that microbial communities are uneven and dominated, does the analysis focus on the dominant taxa, and consider the rate taxa appropriately? The relative abundance of C. diff was shown in supp fig 2, but no data or analysis of dominate taxa was given. 4. How are samples taken and handled before DNA extraction? Mice were given antibiotics and orally given C. difficile spores, then cecal samples were removed from their corpses. The cecal samples were then ground in a mortar and stored at -80 degrees. 5. Are OTU abundances corrected for variance in 16S copy number and for variances in genome size? No. 6. Is sequencing coverage of the communities measured and it is complete? No coverage measures were mentioned. # of sequence per sample not given. No rarefaction curves shown. 7. Does the PCR step contain internal standards? the DNA extraction step? the sequencing step? No, none of the three steps contained internal standards. 8. Is the sampling strategy well described and appropriate for the microbiome of interest? Yes, a description can be found in question 2, and it is appropriate for the microbiome. 9. Can you see total number of sequences obtained per sample and how many after quality filtering (and what criteria are used for quality filtering)? No and filtering steps were not described in detail. 10. 16S profile is normalized. Does the study also use some method to quantify total bacterial numbers, like qPCR or culture? The study measures bacterial metabolites as a quantification method. Additional Comments: The experiment lacked an obvious control group.

The DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing steps utilize many internal standards and controls to ensure that each step is accurately producing the desired outcomes. The PCR amplification step utilizes 35 cycles which is quite high and can lead to the introduction of more errors within the DNA that is amplified therefore reducing the number of cycles to 25 would be beneficial in avoiding this possibility. The sequencing step on an Illumina MiSeq platform using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 300PE is normalized but fails to convey the number of reads that are taken per sample as well as what program is being used to randomly draw each sample. Next, further explanation of how the number of overlapping random OTUs between all pairs of compartments are calculated and why was this step repeated a 10,000 times. Often data sets that have a very large sample size can produce data that appears to be normally distributed but is actually not therefore it is important to determine the effective sample size sample of 10000 to determine the normality of the collected data. A Shapiro wilks test for normality will be useful determining the normality of your data. For statistical analysis, a chi squared test is used to determine the significance of the highest number of random overlapping OTUs among the 10,000 permutations against the number of observed overlapping OTUs for that pair of compartments but there is no mention of an analysis of Alpha, Beta or gamma diversity among the sampled microbiome as well as a designation of goods coverage. To further analyze the soil microbiome, a quantification of the total bacteria community can be done using qPCR or culturing techniques in order to determine the abundance of the bacteria and their mechanisms used to manipulate the community’s ecology. #SHSU3594",2022-03-23T14:34:58,jonathoncorral,Jonathon Corral,10.1101/2020.09.30.320317,Soil microbial diversity impacts plant microbiota more than herbivory,"Antonino Malacrinò, Alison J.

As a researcher with a broad and acute interest in river microbiome, this paper addresses its finding in a more transparent manner. It is impressive to see a detailed method section along with data analysis that shows a high reproducibility of your work. Abstract - Abstract addresses the research question of interest. It also summarizes the important findings of the study. I suggest adding the names of the abundant and rare taxa found in water and sediments into the abstract. Introduction - The introduction is well written using literature available under this topic. This clearly discusses the previous research that points towards the question of interest. Methods - The sampling method is well described. I suggest including the time that samples were collected because this can have a certain impact on the physiological properties of water. Storage of samples in liquid nitrogen is a good approach. Missing information about internal standards used during extraction is a limitation. Details on how the template DNA is quantified after extraction is absent. A negative control or an internal standard that was used to monitor PCR errors is not mentioned in the methodology. I appreciate describing the parameters and criteria used for pre-processing of sequences in detail which improves the reproducibility of your work. Making your raw sequence data accessible to others is commendable. I would suggest you include details about internal standards used in the sequencing step. Defining rare and abundant taxa criteria is appreciated as many studies do not mention that. I would like to see the number of sequences obtained per sample which would also clarify why the sequence data were normalized at this depth of 27,890 sequences per sample. Also, I would suggest you mention the usage of R 4.0.4 for the analysis at an earlier statement under the data analyses section where beta diversity analysis is described. Then the reader will get a better understanding that beta diversity analyses were done using R rather than finding it at the end of the data analysis part. Results- The major findings in terms of the whole, dominant, and rare communities are clearly visualized using boxplots and Venn diagrams. I would suggest you include a table that shows alpha diversity indices (Chao 1, observed OTUs) of each sample along with coverage. Another major suggestion I would like to propose is presenting your results (at least dominant phyla) using a higher taxonomic level like class/family or genus other than phylum level (if possible).

The study has a logical pathway and contains experiments that correlate well with the research question being investigated. Considering this, this study is easy to follow and flows well. It does not take much time to understand the basis of this article. The methods and materials section of this article mainly focuses on 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing in order to create a bacterial profile within the gut microbiome of endurance runners in Japan. By focusing on quality control, I would suggest adding which specific primers were used for PCR. I would also recommend lowering the amount of PCR cycles in order to minimize error and chimeras. I also suggest that there should be more detail in the sampling collection subsection by using the information from the results section. In order to make sure that PCR, DNA extraction, and sequencing occurred with minimal error, I would also suggest having internal standards. For example, using individual strains as a control can help validate the process of 16S profiling. Gluconeogenesis is a highlight within this study and a well-known physiological process within animals. However, I would suggest adding a brief section explaining the process in order to further help the reader understand the material given. Bacteroides uniformis is another focal point in this study. Understanding the background of how this bacteria is normally can also help build a foundation and further strengthen the study. Overall, this study is well done and opens up potential topics of using certain bacteria to evaluate athletic performance levels in humans. This study can also lead into using certain bacterias for therapeutic/rehabilitative purposes.",2022-03-23T02:45:56,,Eduardo Gutierrez,10.1101/2020.03.04.975730,Bacteroides uniformis enhances endurance exercise performance through gluconeogenesis,"Hiroto Morita, Chie Kano, Chiharu Ishii, Noriko Kagata, Takamasa Ishikawa, Yoshihide Uchiyama, Susumu Hara, Teppei Nakamura, Shinji Fukuda",2020-03-05

Another point that interested me, was that they didn’t identify the variable region they’re targeting in the experiment. There was also no mention of the standard filtering of the sequence, what did the team use in this experiment? There was also no variance of the genome size mentioned in the article. The sample retrieving method is mentioned, they extracted the bacterial samples from the vacuum filters and dust collected from the ISS, as well from the astronaut’s skin to characterize. However, what steps were taken to ensure no contamination was introduced within the samples retrieved? The article doesn’t mention how the bacterial samples were kept in sterile environments before shotgun-sequencing. They do mention the method used to quantify the Antibiotic resistance bacterial genes, subculturing the samples retrieved from the space station then comparing them with the same species of bacteria pre- and post-launch for uniqueness. I would suggest adding how the team collected the samples before sequencing, to give the reader insight on what steps were taken to isolate the bacterial genes.

The number of cycles done can introduce errors if it is too high, so a cycle number of around 20-25 is ideal. Did you use universal primers or were there specific ones used? Were any primer pads added to prevent hairpin formation? There is also no mention of a negative control used in the PCR step, or any other internal standards to prevent error. Were there any internal standards steps taken for PCR, extraction, or sequencing? The coverage of alpha and beta diversity is there and is sufficient, but there is also no statistical analyses of gamma diversity of the microbiomes. Gamma diversity is a measure of the overall diversity for the different ecosystems within a region.There is a mention of quality filtering for chimera removal, which is very good. Despite the coverage of chimera filtering, operational taxonomic units are not explained. Did you cluster your OTUs besides the mention of clustering of chimera and singleton ASV reads? If so, why is it not mentioned in the methods?  The Good’s coverage was also not mentioned at all. Was any Good’s coverage calculations done? Or was there any other coverage done, such as chao1 or Shannon’s? Given that this study does use qPCR, that does help to better understand the microbiome as it quantifies the bacteria given instead of just stating the bacteria that is present. The sampling methods are well explained, but I do question if the fecal samples are accurate in determining the microbiome if you were unable to collect them after the race due to dehydration. Is one sample taken before the race sufficient enough to be able to ascertain the microbiome completely, or would there be missing information that could be important?  What did you filter for effective sample size? I think it would be helpful to go more in depth with the quality filtering that was done. Is a 50% completeness for MAGs high enough? When you mention normalizing the abundance for sequencing depth, how was this done? The flow of the paper is good, but the explanations in the methods section could be better. For example, the DNA sequencing steps are not thoroughly explained in this paper, and instead are referenced in other papers, making it difficult to know exactly what was done with the samples prior to extraction without having to go digging for the other papers.. Some questions on extraction can be made, specifically when it comes to the fecal samples. For an accurate depiction of the microbiome of the horses, I believe samples should have been taken before and after the races to understand any differences that might be seen prior to the races instead of what is just present before the race.  #SHSU5394",2022-03-22T23:10:37,,Adalia,10.1101/2022.01.24.477461,The first horse gut microbiome gene catalog reveals that rare microbiome ensures better cardiovascular fitness in endurance horses,"Núria Mach, Cédric Midoux, Sébastien Leclercq, Samuel Pennarun, Laurence Le Moyec, Olivier Rué, Céline Robert, Guillaume Sallé, Eric Barrey",2022-01-24

The use of rats to model addiction was well designed with the employment of the increased electric shock with the increased self-administration of the drug. While looking at your methods for this study, I have a few suggestions that a reviewer might mention in the publication process. Firstly, the insertion of the catheter in the rats included flushings with a saline solution that contained antibiotics. It is unclear if these antibiotics were given throughout the course of the study or just initially during the insertion of the catheter. If there were any preliminary assays performed that showed what or if any changes occurred to the gut microbiome with the administration of the Cefazolin, they should be included in the study. Furthermore, you state that you performed 30 cycles of PCR. There are studies showing that an increase in cycles increases the likelihood of PCR errors, https://journals.asm.org/do.... If the study were to be repeated with fewer cycles, could it result in a similar population census? Just something to keep in mind. I would also suggest performing qPCR on the entire 16S gene to determine the initial abundances of the varying taxa. This real-time quantification is able to correlate the number of cycles with the number of amplicons to determine the initial abundance of the fragments in the sample. With regular fragmentation PCR, there is at best, an establishment of relative abundance. Were there any controls used during PCR and sequencing steps? It is ideal to run a simultaneous amplification and sequencing of known samples to determine if they were successful. These controls should be briefly mentioned during these procedures. As far as describing quality filtering of the amplicons, it would be prudent to specify what exactly is being filtered out, be it chimeras, PCR errors, etc. It is also important to state how many sequences were collected before and after this filtering so that it is apparent if the number of errors is what is to be normally expected. You show that you used QIIME, however, this is an older system and QIIME2 would be more up to date. It is unclear what the inclusion criteria are and what percent of the taxa found are considered in the study. It would be understandable to include the top 15 OTUs in the study, or to only include taxa that make up the majority of the population, so those taxa that are dominant. Also something to note would be what level of identification are you aiming to determine. In your figures, some of the taxa are inconsistently identified at either the genus, family, or order level. Greengenes is a database that is also not as up to date as others, and using a newer program could reveal better taxa ID, preferably species.  Alpha diversity is only briefly addressed and should be further examined by determining Shannon and Simpson’s indexes. When assessing the relative abundance of taxa based on 16S gene amplification, it is important to address those taxa that possess multiple copies of the 16S gene and adjust the abundance accordingly. Another important piece of information to include would be if you assessed sampling coverage. If you did not, it would be good to determine the Goods’ index of the sampling or Chao1 to compare to the number of OTUs found to assess coverage and richness of sample collected. The graphs in the supplemental figures appear to still be showing the generation of new OTUs, whereas if coverage is adequate, there would be a decrease in the number of new OTUs being established. If any of these processes or assays were further explored, the information should be added to the article. It is important to show not only exactly what was done to collect the data and analyze it, but also to verify the conclusions that are being made from the data. Studying any microbiome, especially that of the gut, brings with it much uncertainty. Many steps in the process can result in the loss of data or the introduction of errors, explaining all details in the study will contribute to the confidence in the results you present. #SHSU5394",2022-03-22T18:09:31,,Cheyenne,10.1101/2021.07.20.453110,The gut microbiome is associated with cocaine behavior and predicts addiction vulnerability in adult male rats,"Gregory J Suess, Jennysue Kasiah, Sierra Simpson, Molly Brennan, Dana Conlisk, Lisa Maturin, Olivier L George, Benoit Chassaing, Kyle J Frantz",2021-10-28

I do, however, have a few comments and questions on your study. First, you mention that you are studying the GMB of the fish. You describe this acronym as the gut emicrobiome; however, when I researched this acronym, I was unable to find anything. Is this a typo? Where could I find this information? Second, I was confused about the sample collection of the gar. How did the fishermen catch the fish, specifically what bait was used? Would this affect the gut microbiome of the gar? What food was fed to the fish grown in the lab? Were there significant differences in the GMB based on the collection method? Following that, you state that you squeeze the GMB; I am confused about how you obtained the feces. How did you squeeze the gut microbiome? Would this affect a change in the location? Would you be able to elaborate further on this? Next, while investigating your methods sections, I found some missing information in your PCR step. To improve your study and help end the replication crisis, I would add the PCR cycle number and temperature for this amplification. Thank you for including the variable region and specific primers you used. Finally, I read your sections on bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis and had a suggestion. When I first read the paper, I could not find your Good’s coverage and how you clustered the OTUs. I would move the information on how many clustered sequences and the similarity percentage right after removing the chimeras. Moreover, I was curious about an internal standard for sequencing and clustering analysis. I suggest adding a known strain you grew in the lab to the sample as to confirm that your sequences and binning are correct. Another suggestion would be to elaborate on why you adjusted the identity percentage to 99% with a coverage of 70%. Did this help with the phylogenetic analysis? Is this a quality control for the phylogenetic analysis similar to chimera removal? Overall, this study highlighted the gut microbiome of tropical gar and allowed for further research questions to be asked. I appreciate the amount of information on the method section and implore you to add my suggested feedback.

First, fecal sample collection was mentioned but not the process of how the samples were collected. Was the feces collected after it passed from the monkey or was there some process to collect upper GI samples? The difference in collection methods may affect the presence of certain bacterial species, such as anaerobic species. Second, I did not see internal controls for DNA extraction, PCR, or the sequencing process. Were there any internal controls used to verify the results of each step? So, DNA extraction for example, known bacterial species grown in the lab can be included at specific concentrations and used to calculate how much DNA should be extracted from this known species, this way we can check to make sure the DNA extraction process worked as expected. Third, were there any steps taken to minimize PCR errors (such as ambiguous bases, etc.) and chimeras? It would be beneficial to mention these steps and what programs were used to minimize them in the materials and methods section, for example ChimeraSlayer is often used for removing chimeras. Also, it was mentioned that analysis was performed on samples after rarefaction to 10000 sequences/sample, but how many sequences/sample were there before this rarefaction?

Now we can start to see evidence of what is really going on in the cochlea. Your work raises a whole lot of issues, but I’ll just mention a few key findings. I hope you find these comments helpful. 1. In the abstract a fairly provocative statement is that the data is not explained by current theories. In my view, I don’t think this is quite right, as the motions you reveal appear to be the result of simple resonance between the rows, an idea first raised in my PhD thesis and then in several associated publications. Perhaps the most germane are Bell & Fletcher (2004), The cochlear amplifier as a standing wave, JASA 116, 1016; https://doi.org/10.1121/1.1766053 and Bell (2012), A resonance approach to cochlear mechanics, PLOS One, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0047918. Both papers set out a scheme whereby the three rows of OHCs work together to establish a resonant element which gives rise to a standing wave between the rows. Tuning thus depends largely on the row spacing, not the stiffness of the BM. The OHCs are stimulated virtually instantaneously by the fast pressure wave (OHCs are pressure sensors, for which I’ve made a case elsewhere), not the conventional travelling wave. In this way, I think most of your findings can be accommodated, as set out below. 2. In your Introduction you say that a special sort of phasing is required in order to amplify the travelling wave. This is not necessary if you look at it in terms of resonance. As Bell (2012) broadly explains, the travelling wave is simply the observed result of what happens in response to a graded bank of highly tuned resonators that are almost simultaneously excited by a fast pressure wave. The delay observed is then simply Q/pi cycles, where Q is the tuning sharpness. In other words, I suggest you may be looking at things back-to-front causally: it is the resonance that gives rise to an apparent TW, not that the TW is a causal entity that, through very careful phasing, is able to amplify BM motion and give rise to a large peak! That is, the OHCs don’t amplify motion at all; instead they are pressure transducers which, via electromotility, vibrate in response to the sound pressure surrounding them (the OHCs contain pressure-sensitive ion channels). I’ve published a number of papers on this, and I’m happy to discuss the idea with you in more detail if you wish. In brief, I am suggesting that, if we look at cochlear mechanics differently, the TW is an epiphenomenon of a tuned bank of active elements. The elements are local oscillators – there doesn’t need to be global coupling in order to propagate a TW. 3. I am suggesting that each triplet of OHC1, OHC2, and OHC3 act together like a guitar string arranged radially. However, unlike a string, there is a fluid connection between the rows (a squirting wave) so that the wave travels at a particularly low velocity. Applied to your observations, at a BF of 46 kHz the wave traverses OHC1 to OHC3 (a distance of about 30 um) in 1/46000 of a second – that is, a speed of about 1 m/s. As an explanation, so-called squirting waves have such low phase velocities, and anatomically are well suited to act in the space between the TM and reticular lamina, as Bell & Fletcher (2004) describe. Electromotility of the OHCs causes squeezing in that space, generating squirting waves. 4. At their tuned frequency (BF), the amplitude of vibration is largest, and that is consistent with a resonating element that is tuned to that frequency. Thanks to your high resolution, we can see the activity of each of the three OHCs. In Figure 5c there seems to be a larger amplitude of vibration for RL3 than RL1; another radial profile at a different level (Figure 7c) shows that the amplitudes are about equal. Given the intricate geometry, I think that the findings are generally consistent with a radial standing wave with the OHCs at the antinodes. 5. Now, about the phases. The 3 OHCs seem to have about the same phase, and this is consistent with a standing wave between them. A standing wave is a wave that oscillates in time but whose profile of peak amplitude does not move in space. My papers suggest that OHC2 acts in antiphase to OHC1 and OHC3, an arrangement which is closer to a xylophone bar than a guitar string. In other words, each OHC sits at an antinode, and the result is a full-wavelength standing wave. Your OCT device sees all the OHCs vibrating at the same amplitude, but doesn’t see the wave moving backwards and forwards between them. Other phase arrangements may be possible, but the full wavelength case is probably the simplest. For a guitar string, there is only 1 antinode and 2 nodes, so if this applied in the cochlea, all the work would be done be OHC2 (we wouldn’t need 3 rows of OHCs). 6. Taking together all the above, I hope you may appreciate that if we had a ringing xylophone bar between OHC1 and OHC3 then an OCT device would see all the OHCs vibrating at the same amplitude and the same phase. It would require special techniques to detect the standing wave, and I wonder if your device has that capability. This would provide convincing evidence in favour of a resonance model. 7. Note that in my papers I regard the phase lag at resonance to reflect the group delay of the resonators. For a linear resonator, the group delay amounts to Q/pi cycles. It is interesting to look at the group delays you recorded in Figure 8f-h and Figure 10e,f. At BF (resonance) they show a phase lag of 2–3 cycles. So if one considers these delays to derive from a linear resonator (not strictly true, but perhaps not too far off), then the associated Q values would be pi times 2 or 3, which is about 6–9. Such Q values are roughly the same as those measured otoacoustically for the gerbil. In summary, I suggest it is possible to interpret your findings using a different causal chain, the inverse of what you have done. That is, the causal chain may involve the direct electromotility of OHCs in response to sound pressure, and not that OHCs have to very carefully amplify atomic-scale BM motions to create a traveling wave – and this approach simplifies cochlear mechanics enormously. The alternative view is that the BM may just be a supporting membrane for an array of tuned elements, which are independently excited by the fast pressure wave. Indeed, it is interesting that the ITER team (Khanna and colleagues) adopted this view more than 30 years ago. They said that “The present observations suggest that the outer hair cells vibrate mechanically along their axes in response to acoustical stimulation.” (p.188) https://doi.org/10.3109/00016488909138336. It is perfectly possible to look at your data in a different, but internally consistent, way. I hope this helps us move towards the truth of the matter. Best wishes for your publication.

The authors clarified three points: 1) they confirmed that M. polymorpha does display circadian regulation of several photosynthetic parameters; 2) they showed that light-dark cycles mask circadian cycles for these parameters; 3) by using a pharmacological approach, they showed that chloroplast translation is necessary for the circadian regulation of photosynthesis. The study fills a gap of knowledge in the circadian regulation of photosynthetic activity across evolution, by providing an additional link to what was known in cyanobacteria, microalgae, and vascular plants. It is original and  well-conducted. The interpretation and the discussion of the results is very convincing, and the conclusions are carefully drawn and backed up by the data. Major comments -	Page 7, lines 173-176: it is stated that the differences in period length observed between PAM and DF measurements might be due to differences in light intensity. How about light quality, as the PAM measurements were performed under blue light, vs. mixed red/blue for DF? -	Blue light, which was used in both types of experiments, has been shown to impact circadian rhythms in plants through the action of cryptochromes (e.g. Chaves et al., Annu. Rev. Plant Biol., 2011). Also, BL is responsible for chloroplast relocation responses, which is mediated by phototropins (e.g. see Kong et al. Plant and Cell Physiology, 2013). In Arabidopsis it can also impact plastid transcription through the intermediate of the blue-responsive plastid sigma factor SIG5 (Tsunoyama et al, FEBS Lett. 2002) and it is regulated by BL photoreceptors cryptochromes (Onda 2007, Plant Journal). Can you comment on these potential effects? Has their involvement in Marchantia polymorpha been investigated? Did they motivate your use of blue light for these experiments? -	Page 13, lines 316-323, please discuss the lack of effect on circadian rhythm by rifampicin: at first it may appear odd that translation has an effect but transcription doesn’t. Could it be due to rifampicin only inhibiting PEP and transcription by NEP compensates? -	Page 14, lines 354-363: 1)	Is there a reason why you performed light curves with increasing light intensity up to 789 µmol m-2 s-1 if you end up using only the data with light intensity closer to growth conditions (108 µmol m-2 s-1)? 2)	Could the 20 minutes of dark-adaptation every two hours and increasing light intensity up to 789 µmol m-2 s-1 have affected the circadian rhythms of plants that were supposed to be at constant LL? This experimental setup could be considered as fluctuating light condition. Please discuss whether this may have an effect on the observed results. Minor comments -	Page 2, lines 27-28, ""the circadian regulation of several measures of photosynthetic biochemistry (delayed fluorescence, the rate of photosynthetic electron transport, and non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence)"": please rephrase this sentence as it seems that the circadian regulation has an effect on the measurements themselves while they are tools to see something happening at photosynthetic levels. We suggest replacing it with ""circadian regulation affects photosynthesis performances, detectable by several photosynthetic parameters such as delayed fluorescence, the rate of photosynthetic electron transport, and non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence"". Same can be applied in Pages 4-5, lines 98-99. -	Page 4, lines 84-90, this sentence is very long and difficult to read, please rephrase and split it into at least two sentences for better readability and clarity. -	Page 5, lines 114-118, discussion might be a better place for this. -	Page 5, line 118, please replace ""Features of PAM fluorescence"" with ""Features of chlorophyll fluorescence as measured by PAM"" as the first indicates a specific method to measure an intrinsic phenomena (Chl fluo) and it is not the only one for Chl fluo measurements. -	Page 5, line 123, please replace ""PAM metrics"" with ""prompt fluorescence"" for consistency with DF, named just before. -	Page 6, lines 126-127, to be consistent with the nomenclature, ""LL"" should be ""low light"", not ""constant light"". Consider replacing LL with CLL (""constant low light"") since the plants are actually exposed to a lower light compared to the standard growth light described in materials and methods. Also, please include in the description of the light conditions “LD” together with its full name (which is directly mentioned before in line 138 without its full name ""light-dark cycles""). -	Pages 6-7, lines 152-154, this sentence is more technical and it does not seem necessary to understand and interpret the results described later. Please consider moving this sentence in Material and methods to keep the results section more readable. -	Page 7, lines 167-172, please provide a reason why photosynthetic activity was measured only under LL and not also in the other two conditions described for DF. -	Page 8, lines 196-199, reading the text it seems you used only T24 and T28. Please list all the T lengths (T20, T22, T24 and T28) as reported in Figure 3 legend. -	Page 10, line 254, please add a short sentence to briefly comment the results obtained with the rifampicin treatment. -	Page 13, lines 316-318, ""Perhaps inhibiting the expression of these proteins prevents or reduces PSII repair, which disrupts circadian cycles of the rate of electron transport by interfering with the electron transport process"". Please rephrase this sentence, as it is written it can be interpreted as defective PSII repair disrupts circadian cycles. -	Page 13, line 335, describe conditions of its natural habitat “such as”. -	Page 14, lines 341, in the growth conditions you describe that the standard light conditions used were 100 μmol photons m-2 s-1 of white light. Is there a reason why for the DF experiment described in this manuscript you decided to use 60 µmol m-2 s-1? -	Page 18, legend of Figure 1: line 421, “thallus” should be “thalli”; “light/cycles” should read “light/dark cycles”. -	Line 430, define FFT-NLLS. -	Please move the definition of RAE from lines 433-434, to its first occurrence line 430. -	Line 433, define SEM. -	Page 19, line 470, please write SEM instead of s.e.m., for consistency with the legend of Figure 1. -	Figure 1: the figure is very big and can create confusion, please consider to split it in two figures, e.g. a-f Figure1 and g-k Figure 2. -	In the legend, include the abbreviations for the light conditions and correct ""ligh/cycles"" with ""light-dark cycles"" as reported in the text. -	Panel g. Please better describe this panel, especially the colours meaning in the clock. -	Figure 1 (a,c,e) 2 and Figure 4: the alternance of white and light grey bands to mark the 12h periods can be very easily misinterpreted as light/dark cycles. To clarify and display the constant light conditions at a glance, please consider using another means to evidence them, such as dashed lines. -	Figure 4: similarly to Figure 1, this figure is very large and hard to read. Consider splitting it. -	Please write the concentrations of lincomycin and rifampicin in the relevant panels, as the different shades are difficult to distinguish and understand in panels a-d, g-j, m-p and s-v. -	Panels f-l and r-x: please use the same scale on the y axis, or, if not possible, bring attention of the reader to the different scale in the figure legend. At first, we were puzzled by the ‘no-treatment’ not starting from similar amplitudes.

There are some methodological issues that could be important in the interpretation of their results. Because the authors used wide-field imaging with one-photon excitation, which results in PSFs that are likely several times larger than the size of a spine (after tissue scattering), it is likely that the spine signals were contaminated by dendritic ones and by out of focus contributions. Also, since the experiments were performed in brain slices, and near the cut surface of the tissue, the studied spines may not have been in a physiological state. Moreover, the repeated patching of the neurons could lead to cellular damage, and the long periods of whole cell dialysis and high light exposure add serious risk of incident photo damage, affecting neuron’s biophysical properties. Indeed, dendritic beading, a classic sign of tissue damage already described by Cajal, is evident in most of their images. Also, although glutamate uncaging has been broadly validated by many groups, including our own, it is still not equivalent to the response of spines when synaptically activated in a physiological state, which could involve different set of receptors, conductances, inhibitory signals, etc.. With respect to the criticisms they raise about our recently published work (Cornejo et al, 2021), aside from major experimental differences in species (rat vs. mouse) and age (developing vs. adult animals) and without dwelling in the details of the analysis, we would simply encourage the authors to view our movies of voltage imaging of dendrites in vivo. In these movies, included as supplementary material in our recent paper ( https://www.science.org/sto..., one can directly see with one’s own eyes how individual spines are often activated in the absence of any significant depolarization in the dendrites. Also, while the authors suggest that the voltage compartmentalization could be an artifact of the slow sampling, in fact, the known frequency-depending filtering of electrical signals would predict the opposite. Finally, we would note that the authors own data (Fig. 1, for example) confirms the large amplitude of spine potentials made in our recent paper and in the intracellular recordings of Jayant et al. 2016, which they criticize. It is important to mention that many previous experimental or calculated explorations of spine voltage compartmentalization (Harnett et al., 2012; Tonnesen et al., 2014; Jayant at al., 2017; Kwon et al., 2017; Cornejo et al., 2022), have revealed a significant heterogeneity in spine responses. Indeed, even disregarding the technical issues mentioned above, inspections of the authors’ own data, for example Figure 1D (or in Popovic at al., 2015), demonstrates that a significant number of spines are compartmentalizing voltage to a similar extent than what we have measured in vivo. The authors ignore these data points and the heterogeneity that their results reveal. Given this, and the methodological problems of their approach, we would encourage the authors to soften their tone in their one-sided conclusions and do justice to their own data. We are looking forward to constructively conciliate different experiments and interpretations in order to better understand together spine physiology and biophysics.",2022-03-07T15:26:54,,Rafael Yuste,10.1101/2022.02.15.480607,Contribution of individual excitatory synapses on dendritic spines to electrical signalling,"Ju-Yun Weng, Cesar Ceballos, Dejan Zecevic",2022-02-17

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.12.472313v1#comment-5777208223,biorxivstage,0,"This manuscript describes a computational pipeline to predict how antibody (and other “therapeutic entities”) binding varies to different SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variants. The goal of this pipeline is to be able to generate structural models of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants in complex with existing therapeutics (nanobodies, antibodies, etc) and (re)design antibodies to maintain or improve antibody binding interactions. The authors initially develop a set of computed structural models (CSMs - an acronym/term that we find unnecessary and confusing, wouldn’t “model” suffice?) of Omicron Spike protein bound to ACE2 and therapeutic entities using experimentally-determined structures optimized by Rosetta FastRelax or predicted structures from AlphaFold2. The major confusion we have with this paper is the utility of generating predicted structures from AlphaFold2 when there are numerous experimentally-determined structures available on the PDB as starting models for mutagenesis and Rosetta optimization. The justification for using AF2 is not outlined clearly in the manuscript, and the data do not suggest that AF2 provides any obvious benefits over using Rosetta alone. The majority of the paper uses a consensus approach to score predictions based on different procedures. However, we could see a compelling argument for using AF2 in future VOC (or new viruses) that are even more diverged than Omicron. If this is the type of future application the authors imagine, presenting consensus scores as the sum of scores instead of the individual scores for each procedure undermines the potential comparative utility of having both experimental and predicted models in this analysis (a potential strength of the manuscript). The major limitation of this study is that it is purely computational and while the anecdotal evidence that certain clinically relevant antibodies retain (or lose) effectiveness against Omicron is a good validation, the rescue mutant studies will likely have little resonance with the community until validated experimentally. Perhaps there is a greater argument to be made based on some of the deep mutational scanning data that is emerging. The presentation of energetic changes as either “stabilizing” or “destabilizing” without accompanying quantitative values or calibration to experiment obscures the magnitude of de/stabilization caused by each amino acid substitution. Overall, this manuscript is an interesting exploration of how researchers can utilize computational structural biology to (re)design therapeutics in real-time to address the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The manuscript would benefit from providing stronger justification of why predicted structures can be essential for understanding how host-pathogen protein:protein interfaces evolve in an evolving pandemic - and from learning how to make those predictions stronger. Major Points 1. The justification for generating CSMs with and without position coordinate restraints should be explained. 2. Consensus Scoring currently obscures the Rosetta Energy Unit value for each CSM and does not help the reader better understand why 4 CSMs are needed to accomplish the outlined goal of the paper. 3. Is it conceivable that the degree of (de)stabilization is related to the magnitude of the REU value, i.e. 1.4 REU vs 3 REU? 4. L309-311: Citation 26 proposes that Omicron may have developed into immunosuppressed chronically infected COVID-19 patients, but this is a hypothesis and not currently supported by data. I would remove this statement or cite primary literature supporting this claim such as Kemp, S.A., Collier, D.A., Datir, R.P. et al. SARS-CoV-2 evolution during treatment of chronic infection. Nature 592, 277–282 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41.... 5. Figure 2A: why is the cryoEM structure overlaid with the predicted structure? The structures look nearly identical, so unclear what this representation adds. If positional differences between experimental and predicted structure is important, color residues in AF2 structure by RMSD. 6. Figure 2B-C: if you’re trying to highlight changes in the extensive interaction network between WT and Omicron, show as an overlay. 7. Figure 3: this figure does not make sense. 8. Figure 2, 4-10: Represent WT and Omicron comparisons as an overlay in one panel instead of two structures in side by side panels. This will be easier for reader to visualize the differences. Minor Points 1. Refer to Wuhan-Hu-1 as WT, by NCBI number, or other identifier that does not use the city name, so as to reduce stigma. 2. L121: The definition of “cocktail” as “two or more bound proteins in a single multi-protein complex.” The term “multi-protein” implies two or more proteins, either protomers of the same protein or monomers of different proteins. Suggested edits would be “two or more proteins bound to an oligomeric protein complex (ACE2 trimer).” 3. L132: Define pLDDT earlier than line 136. 4. L152-154: Why were N- and C-termini included in both experimental and predicted models if they are not necessary and will skew the overall Calpha RMSD? 5. L251-252: Recommend adding a figure/table showing sequence consensus between Omicron and other variants only for AA sites mutated in Omicron 6. Figure 2A: In the inset, it is unclear why Res 387-389 are annotated if the authors want to focus on Res 364-376. I would show the full residue range 364-376 as sidechains and label each residue. It seems that there are additional residues 477-478 shown as sidechains in the full image to represent mutations found in omRBD. This is unclear from the text and figure legend. I recommend removing the inset. 7. If using a yellow-to-green spectrum coloring scheme, include a scale bar on the image. Also, yellow to green is a difficult color spectrum to visually interpret, and this is made more difficult given that the backbone is colored green.

For now, a few comments: + In Fig. 1, the two peaks that merge into one come very clearly from two independent nucleation events. Eventually, the two clusters merge. + In the case of GSY at the lowest concentration (Fig. 2), there certainly is diffusion of the condensate from left to right of the box, even if part of the effect in the figure may be due the COM-centering in the density calculation.  At the lowest concentrations there is barely enough ""protein"" for spanning the box from side to side and hence the condensate is more droplet-like. I think it makes sense that the condensate diffuses more easily than when the slab is thicker and comfortably spans the simulation box. + With respect to the single or multiple nucleation spots (e.g. GSY 2 M), I haven't yet looked at critical number of particles, but from my many simulations, I can say different things will happen in different runs.

Quick question, when we see in figure 1 the formation of two smaller clusters before emerging a larger and single one, can we say these are initial LLPS formation steps or two well-formed smaller condensates that fuse into a bigger one? It's interesting to see in figure 2 that lower concentration GSY condensates diffuse from left to right in the box, while higher concentration condensates remain fixed (don't diffuse) once formed. Is this an MD artefact, or does it represent larger bodies' diffusion hindrance? Also, in figure 2 B), for 2M concentrations, we see forming two initial condensation spots (dark blue). In contrast, this is not so visible for other concentrations, and the system seems to transit straight to a single cluster. Is there a concentration lower and upper limit to form these initial smaller clusters? Have you found this behaviour to depend much on the initial seed number? It does depend on the force-field, as seen in FigS1. Minor typos. fig 4: y-axis legend of panel C - missing ( figS1 - have the starting colours be a bit darker.

Previous work has shown that the transcription factors QstR and TfoY are key regulators of the V. cholerae T6SS in a pandemic strain, but the authors demonstrate constitutive expression and activity of the T6SS in other V. cholerae strains that have a single SNP in the intergenic region upstream of the T6SS genes. This work has important implications for how T6SS expression has evolved in different V. cholerae lineages, and the conditions under which the T6SS is active in different strains. More broadly, the paper demonstrates that a single SNP in an intergenic region can dramatically affect gene expression. The data are of high quality throughout the paper, and the use of complementary assays of T6SS activity and expression provides independent assessment of T6SS regulation. The major conclusion of the paper is that a T at position -68 is associated with strong expression/activity of the T6SS, whereas a G at -68 has much lower T6SS expression/activity unless qstR is overexpressed. This conclusion is well supported by the data. However, the authors also argue that having a T at position -68 makes T6SS expression independent of QstR, but they do not test this. It may simply be that a T at -68 leads to overall higher expression of T6SS genes that could be further boosted by overexpression of qstR. Whether or not T6SS expression is affected by QstR in strains with -68T has important implications for the mechanism by which position -68 influences T6SS expression. Major Comments: 1. The authors claim in several places that the base identity at position -68 determines whether or not T6SS expression is activated by QstR. However, the authors do not test whether overexpression of qstR (i.e., the qstR * strain) impacts expression of T6SS genes in strains with a T at -68. For some strains, expression may already be so high that any effect of qstR overexpression will be difficult to see, but that is likely not the case for strains VC22, 2479-86, and 2512-86. The authors should test the effect of overexpression of qstR on T6SS expression or activity in one or more of these strains. 2. The paper implies that QstR expression is induced by chitin. This connection should be more clearly explained. If QstR expression is indeed induced by chitin, an important additional experiment would be to show that chitin promotes T6SS expression/activity in C6706, and that this effect is reduced in a Δ qstR strain. Minor Comments: 1. We recommend quantifying the data shown in Figure 1G and moving this to the supplement. Alternatively, Figure 1G could be removed from the paper since it is largely redundant with Figure 1C. 2. It would be helpful to modify Figure 3A to include the phylogenetic tree from Figure S3. 3. Position -68 is sometimes referred to as -388, presumably reflecting the position relative to the start codon of the first gene in the operon. We recommend using “-68” throughout. 4. One of the data points in Figure 2B/C is labeled as “IGRV52”. While this is correctly labeled, we suggest changing the label to “G-68T”, as this makes the figure easier to interpret and easier to compare to Figure 2D/E. 5. There are published ChIP-seq data for QstR. It would be informative to briefly discuss where QstR binds relative to position -68. This could be indicated in Figure 2A. 6. The discussion is very brief. We encourage the authors to elaborate on (i) possible mechanisms by which the SNP at position -68 alters T6SS expression, and (ii) possible selective pressures associated with the SNP at -68 for the different V. cholerae strains. 7. A figure at the end of the paper showing a model for the two types of regulation would be helpful for readers. This schematic could include what we already know about the roles of TfoX, TfoY, and QstR in T6SS regulation.",2022-02-28T21:28:13,disqus_y9FR6hyg5J,Joseph Wade,10.1101/2022.01.11.475911,Evolution of a cis-acting SNP that controls Type VI Secretion in Vibrio cholerae,"Siu Lung Ng, Sophia Kammann, Gabi Steinbach, Tobias Hoffmann, Peter J Yunker, Brian K.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.21.481304v1#comment-5772524472,biorxivstage,2,"Congratulations on these very interesting results. Together with the functional data, the new structures described in this preprint greatly contribute to a better understanding of neuromedin U receptors (NMURs) and potentially related peptide-binding GPCRs. Here, I add a short, constructive comment regarding one of the NMURs’ related peptide-binding GPCRs, i.e., the neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1). In wild-type NTSR1, residue 3.33 is Asp, not Glu. Therefore, the labeling of residue 3.33 in the panel “JMV449-NTSR1” in Supplementary Fig. 5d should be corrected. In addition, the sentence in lines 119–121 of the main text PDF beginning with “Noteworthily, a conserved salt bridge between...” should be slightly changed; e.g., “E3.33” should be changed to “E/D3.33” or to “acidic residue at position 3.33”. The shorter D3.33 side chain in NTSR1 compared to E3.33 in the related NTSR2, NMURs, ghrelin receptor, and motilin receptor probably affects the strength and possibly the role of the ionic interaction between the acidic residue at position 3.33 and R6.55 in NTSR1 compared to the above-mentioned related receptors. In the ghrelin receptor, the salt bridge between E3.33 and R6.55 has been proposed to play a role in the receptor’s constitutive activity [ https://doi.org/10.1038/s41... ], and the same could also apply to NTSR2. In contrast, NTSR1, which bears D3.33, has almost no constitutive activity. The shorter D3.33 side chain probably plays a role in agonist-induced activation of NTSR1 [DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abe5504 (ref. 47 in this preprint)] and is related to the “R6.55-mediated activation mechanism” that the authors of this preprint point out in the Discussion section.

The authors introduce inducible shRNAs against the native PRKACA into a PDX model of FLC. The shRNA target regions that are common for the DNAJB1-PRKACA and the native PRKACA. Inducing shRNA expression reduces protein levels of both proteins. The authors show a reduction in tumor volume in the PDX model during doxycycline treatment. However, expression of endogenous PRKACA is essential for most cell types and knockout of PRKACA is embryonically lethal. As the shRNAs are not specific to the fusion oncogene, no claim can be made that FLC cells are addicted to DNAJB1-PRKACA. Additionally, they fail to demonstrate specificity for FLC (e.g. by using the shRNAs in models of HCC).  The experiments demonstrate that PRKACA is an essential gene for FLC cells, which holds true for most cell types. The authors additionally demonstrate that two molecules that inhibit PRKACA also slow tumor growth. This result similarly fails to reveal oncogenic addiction: it lacks specificity between native PRKACA and DNAJB1-PRKACA as well as specificity for FLC. Therapeutic strategies that target PRKACA are expected to show significant toxicities to most cells and tumors.

Genes of unknown functions represent a critical gap in microbiology as they prevent deeper insights into the ecology and evolution of key microbial traits and their impact on microbial phenotypes, thus, the purpose and findings of the study are of great interest. While we commend their efforts to unify known and unknown gene families and generate community resources such as https://novelfams.cgmlab.org/, we regretfully report that the manuscript by Rodríguez del Río et al. fails to acknowledge extensive previous work on this topic such as FUnkFams by Wyman et al. [1], and our recent study by Vanni et al. [2], which has made available a similar resource, AGNOSTOS-DB [3]. Even though studies mentioned here have already reported many of the major findings reported in Rodríguez del Río et al., the current manuscript does not cite FUnkFams, and cites Vanni et al. only once from the Introduction, without highlighting significant parallels between the approaches and findings of the two studies, which we find unfortunate. Here we highlight key similarities between Rodríguez del Río et al. (first posted on bioRxiv on January 27, 2022) and Vanni et al (first posted on bioRxiv on July 01, 2020): - Both studies report that the largest number of gene clusters with unknown function or novel protein families (hereafter referred to as unknowns) are found in uncultivated taxa.  Rodríguez del Río et al. describe their findings in the section "" High content of unknown protein families in the genomes of uncultivated taxa"". Vanni et al. report the same observation, "" the phyla with a larger number of MAGs are enriched in GCs of unknown function"" and are mainly composed of "" newly described phyla such as Cand. Riflebacteria and Cand. Patescibacteria (Anantharaman et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2015; Rinke et al., 2013), both with the largest unknown to known ratio"" (Figure 5D, Supp. Note 14) and that "" metagenome-assembled genomes are not only unveiling new regions of the microbial universe (42% of the reference genomes in GTDB_r86), but they are also enriching the tree of life with genes of unknown function"". - Both studies identify unknowns that are lineage-specific.  Rodríguez del Río et al. identify "" a core set of 980 protein family clusters synapomorphic for entire uncultivated lineages —that is, present in nearly all MAGs/SAGs from a given lineage (90% coverage) but never detected in other taxa (...) these newly discovered protein families can accurately distinguish 16 uncultivated phyla, 19 classes, and 90 orders, involving 179, 104, and 697 novel protein families, respectively."". Vanni et al. provide more than 600K lineage-specific gene clusters of unknown function within the domain Bacteria (36 at the phylum level, 428 at the class level, and 1,641 at the order level (Supp. Table 10)) and Archaea (1 phylum, 25 classes, and 378 orders (Supp. Table 13-1)). - Both studies conclude that there is an increase in the number of lineage-specific unknowns towards the lower levels of taxonomy (i.e., genus, and species).  Rodríguez del Río et al. report these results in Figure 3C and Vanni et al. in Figure 5A. - Both studies report that the unknowns could be considered relevant from an evolutionary perspective. Rodríguez del Río et al. provide a set of novel gene families that are phylogenetically conserved and under purifying selection, which parallels an observation that has been described in Vanni et al. based on phylogenetic conservatism of traits: "" the unknown GCs are more phylogenetically conserved (GCs shared among members of deep clades) than the known (Fig. 5B, p < 0.0001), revealing the importance of the genome's uncharacterized fraction. However, the lineage-specific unknown GCs are less phylogenetically conserved (Fig. 5B) than the known, agreeing with the large number of lineage-specific GCs observed at Genus and Species level (Fig. 5A)."" - Both studies find unknowns that are widely distributed in the environment. Rodríguez del Río et al. report that  "" the majority of the new protein families (55%) are detected in more than ten samples, span at least two habitats"", indicating a possible role as "" core molecular functions from widespread microbial lineages, or derive from promiscuous mobile elements."". Similarly, Vanni et al. report the existence of a ""pool of broadly distributed environmental unknowns"", which "" identified traces of potential ubiquitous organisms left uncharacterized by traditional approaches"". Furthermore, the results reported by Vanni et al. also support the findings observed by Coelho et al. [4] and mentioned by Rodríguez del Río et al. “ This result contrasts with the habitat-specific pattern observed for the majority of individual species-level genes ” where Vanni et al. also show the narrow ecological distribution of the unknown fraction reported in Figure 4D. In addition, as shown by our colleagues in Holland-Moritz et al. [5] the majority of these dominant unknown genes are associated with mobile genetic elements in the soil. - Both studies report a collection of small proteins of unknown function. In Rodríguez del Río et al. they report  "" 13,456 families of proteins shorter than 50 residues, 486 of which have been reported previously as novel functional genes"" in Sberro et al. (2019). Vanni et al. report a similar  finding: "" 12,313 high-quality gene clusters [..] encoding for small proteins ( "" Parallels in major scientific insights between the two studies likely stem from parallels in computational strategies implemented to study datasets of similar nature. Overlaps between computational approaches implemented and described by Vanni et al. and Rodríguez del Río et include the following: - Both studies apply strict quality and novelty filters to generate the basic dataset. In  Rodríguez del Río et al.  Figure 1A shows the basic workflow used to compile “ a collection of high-quality novel protein families from uncultivated taxa ”. Similarly, Vanni et al. workflow (Supp. Fig 1) produce “ highly conserved intra-homogeneous ” gene clusters (Figure 1B), “ both in terms of sequence similarity and domain architecture homogeneity; it exhausts any existing homology to known genes and provides a proper delimitation of the unknown genes ” to provide “ the best representation of the unknown space ”. - Both studies group the predicted genes into gene clusters using the clustering workflow of the software MMseqs2 [6] with a minimum identity threshold of 30%. - Both studies detect and remove spurious genes searching the AntiFam [7] database. - Both studies use a multi-search approach with different sensitivity levels to confidently identify unknowns. - Both studies search the unknowns against a database generated by Price et al. [8] using RB-TnSeq experiments.  Rodríguez del Río et al. wrote “ we mapped the protein family signatures derived from our catalog against the set of 11,779 unknown genes recently annotated based on genome-wide mutant fitness experiments, and found 69 matches to genes associated with specific growth conditions ”. Vanni et al. wrote, “ We searched the 37,684 genes of unknown function associated with mutant phenotypes from Price et al. (2018) [...] to identify genes of unknown function that are important for fitness under certain experimental conditions ”. - Rodríguez del Río et al. identify “ Synapomorphic protein families ”, “ by calculating the clade specificity and coverage of each protein family across all GTDB v202 lineages ”. “ Coverage was calculated as the number of genomes containing a specific protein family over the total number of genomes under the target clade. Specificity was estimated as the percentage of protein members within a family that belonged to the target clade. We considered protein families as synapomorphic if they contained at least 10 members (i.e., protein sequences from different genomes) and had a coverage higher than 0.9 and a specificity of 1.0 for a given lineage. ” Vanni et al. similarly identify a gene cluster as lineage-specific if present in less than half of all genomes and at least 2 with F1-score > 0.95 using the methods described in Mendler et al. [9], where the F1-score is calculated combining trait precision and sensitivity, where Precision indicates the degree to which a trait is conserved within a lineage, and sensitivity the exclusivity of that trait to a lineage. Indeed, both studies also included novel findings that are not covered by either. We recognize the following findings as novel findings that are unique to the study by Rodríguez del Río et al., and are not covered by recent literature to the best of our knowledge: - Rodríguez del Río et al. calculate the dN/dS ratio for each protein family, showing that the majority of unknown families are under a strong purifying selection (Figure 1B). - Rodríguez del Río et al. also investigate the presence of potential antimicrobial peptides in their novel families and “ found 965 unknown protein families in the genomic context of well-known antibiotic resistance genes, 25 of which are embedded in clear genomic islands with more than 3 resistance-related neighbor genes (as predicted by CARD) (Figure 2C). ” - Rodríguez del Río et al. report that “ unknown protein families are slightly enriched in transmembrane and signal peptide-containing proteins (being 7.6% and 7.9% more frequent than in eggNOG, respectively), which suggests that they may play an important role in mediating interactions with the environment.” - Vanni et al. pinpoint the potential of genomic context analyses to generate functional hypotheses both in Supp. Note 12 (“ Next, we examined the genomic neighborhood of the broad distributed EU on the MAG contigs. Investigating the genomic neighborhood can lead to the inference of a possible function of the EU. ”, Figure 12-1 C ) and in the genomic neighborhood analysis shown in Figure 6D. However, Rodríguez del Río et al. provide a much more exhaustive analysis of the genomic context of protein families of unknown function. They provide a summary of unknown protein families linked to metabolic marker genes (“ Presence/absence matrix of unknown protein families forming operon-like structures with marker genes involved in energy and xenobiotic degradation KEGG pathways in Figure 2A.” and “ unknown protein families tightly coupled with genes for every nitrogen cycling step (Figure 2B). ”). Overall, they identify “ 74,356 (17.98%) novel protein families in phylogenetically conserved operon regions ”, and a total of 1,344 families sharing a genomic context with “ genes related to energy production or xenobiotic compound degradation pathways ”. - Moreover, Rodríguez del Río et al. identify unknown families probability involved in “ cell-cell or cell-environment interactions ” and reported “ 502 novel families from the Patescibacteria group potentially involved in molecular transportation, 34 in adhesion, and 13 in cytokinesis ”. Science is incremental, and significant overlaps between different studies can be seen as an opportunity to address the reproducibility crisis in science. However, failure to recognize previous work appropriately has serious implications. Not only does it make it difficult for future generations to trace the origins of novel ideas, but also impacts the careers and well-being of ECRs. We hope the authors will reconsider their omission of the previous work and cite novel findings that are already published. Antonio Fernandez-Guerra, On behalf of all authors of Vanni et al.

Answering your question about the sterility of selection - this research forms part of a broader and long-term study of various life forms in permafrost, mainly microorganisms. In our work, we used the methods accepted, tested and published by many microbiologists (Juck DF, et al., 2005; Shi et al., 1997; Abramov et al., 2021). Unlike you expected permafrost is not a dynamic system; on the contrary, it is a very stable environment, with a constant negative temperature, the absence of free water and the possibility of diffusion from the surface of modern soil. The burrow where the nematodes were isolated was collected from a depth of about 40 meters from the surface. It remained frozen during sampling, transport and storage in the laboratory. Live worms were obtained in the laboratory after thoroughly cleaning the frozen sample under sterile conditions and thawing. In the frozen sample, the organisms  were in a cryptobiotic/frozen state. The absence of background contamination is very important - nematodes (as well as living protozoa) were obtained only from this burrow sample, and they were not found in the enclosing frozen sediment above and below the burrow.  Apart from our study, several other studies of living organisms isolated from samples of buried burrows and soils of the Kolyma outcrops have already been published by biologists and virologists (Yashina et al., 2012; Legendre et al., 2014). As for your question regarding the radiocarbon dating, this outcrop has been previously dated by many paleontologists and geologists using various methods (Murton et al., 2015), our dating correlates well with data obtained earlier. We did not carbon date the nematode itself, but the plant material contained in the burrow. The method of radiocarbon dating of plant or animal material from an ancient burrow is accepted widely  in studies of  lifeforms  survived in the permafrost  (Abramovetal.,2021). We really appreciate your interest in our work and thank you for your comments. We hope we clarified your queries and please write to us if you have any further questions.",2022-02-22T14:11:56,vamshidhargade,Vamshidhar Gade,10.1101/2022.01.28.478251,Nematodes can survive in a suspended form of life for indefinite time,"Anastasia Shatilovich, Vamshidhar R.

I think the applicable audience would be considerably greater if you add a few comparisons including: 1. delivery efficiency of the icRNA compared against traditional 5' capped, 3' polyA mRNA with/without nucleoside modifications and the prior reported pre-injected circularized RNA systems (with same IRES) A. If you do compare to standard polyA mRNA, one of the benefits that could be included is better packaging efficiency in LNPs since the polyA is known to disrupt efficient LNP production 2. Delivery efficacy as a percent transfection or geometric mean fluorescence in vitro with dose titration. The figure 1 b microscope image is also missing scale bars 3. Delivery efficacy in vivo for expression assessment with luciferase RNA at a minimum would be much more informative than immunogenicity assessment or gene editing Other comments from a limited read through: 1. ELISA presentation without indicating the dilution factor of the serum (I see 50-fold dilution in methods) doesn't give much information beyond the fact that it seems your LNPs or RNA cargo didn't work particularly well compared to standard LNPs with nucleoside modified mRNA 2. one of the primary benefits of pre-endocytosis circularized mRNA is thought to be avoidance of TLR activation. It might be beyond the scope, but you could consider comparing the different constructs for TLR and RIG-I activation using in vitro reporter lines like those from Invivogen. 3. Presumably in situ circularization is not compatible with nucleoside modifications but it'd be really interesting to check given that that the non-nucleoside modified RNA as a linear construct being endocytosed would encounter the same TLR challenges experienced as standard mRNA. Perhaps there's a way to generate a hybrid construct where the regions acted upon enzymatically are unmodified and you can incorporate nucleoside modifications for the coding sequence to minimize inherent immunogenicity?",2022-02-22T02:23:47,disqus_2QfOMtjwMY,David R.
