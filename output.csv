I'll use it for my current NFF project on pathways towards the GBF targets. I missed an important, additional reference though, which is the IPBES, 2023 document on zenodo. https://zenodo.org/records/8171339 It is an IPBES document, with the plenary approved description of the NFF and it's official figure (which has been modified since Pereira 2020) as well as a 1st version methodological guidance on using the NFF. I especially wanted to point out this reference, since your figure 5 is graphically so extremely similar to the approved NFF figure, but without reference to this document. That is either a coincidence, in which case to avoid confusion I'd suggest seeing how to make the two more dissimilar since conceptually they are different. Or on purpose, in which case I think adding 'adapted from IPBES, 2023' is appropriate. Happy to discuss if needed.

The draft provides good arguments about the importance of developing and the capabilities of denoising methods to improve the quality of high-resolution fMRI data. To further strengthen the impact of this work, we would suggest openly sharing the code with the fMRI community. We believe that there is a high need for improvement in data quality that may come not only from better data acquisition but also from data denoising. If code becomes available, we would love to explore this methodology on our own datasets.

The work is of great relevance in the field of extracellular vesicles (EVs), as it explores the role of the SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) pathway in the packaging of post-translational proteins in these structures. The data corroborate other studies that seek to understand the packaging mechanisms of extracellular vesicles that can influence the function of vesicles and, consequently, their interaction with target cells, such as in astrocytes, enriching the knowledge of how these pathways are involved in the construction of EVs and modifications, in this case protein modifications. One detail that caught my attention was the terms used and I would like to comment on a few things: Extracellular vesicles are complex structures that carry information in cellular communication, being responsible for the exchange of molecules between cells, including proteins, lipids, and genetic material. Their function in cellular communication depends on the specific composition of each vesicle, which can vary depending on the type of cell that releases it, for example in the modulation of biological processes, such as the immune response. In addition, the field of study with EV is being increasingly explored, precisely because these small structures are mediators in such important functions in target cells 1,2. However, it is still an area that is expanding and many terms, nomenclatures, and methodologies are still being discussed. Therefore, the use of more general terms involving location, group, and nomenclatures can be strategic to avoid having data invalidated in the future. For example, today the nomenclature “microvesicles” has been invalidated, “exosomes” discouraged and “extracellular vesicles” is well accepted according to MISEV (Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles)3. Another suggestion is to be cautious when declaring the position of the components of these structures if there is no data presented that confirms whether it is inside, on the surface or if it is transmembrane in these released structures. I suggest that the authors perform an assay that really shows the location of the protein. The viability data should be presented in a graph to support the integrity of the extracellular vesicles obtained. Another control that I believe should be incorporated is the graph of the populations (size and quantity) by NTA obtained from a portion of the sample of extracellular vesicles used in the functional assay, with the corresponding results. Thus, the quantity of extracellular vesicles used can be calculated and also corroborates that the quantity of vesicles does not interfere with the effect on astrocytes, but rather on the proteins involved in SUMOylation. Finally, when performing functional assays with extracellular vesicles, it is important to incorporate rigorous controls to validate the results. The viability of the cells subjected to vesiculation can also be assessed using rezasurin, and data on the size and quantity of EVs can be presented using NTA (Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis) graphs to ensure that the samples used in the functional assays followed a methodology for good purification and preservation of the integrity of these vesicles. Since storage at -80°C can compromise the bilayer of the EV membrane, the results obtained for size and quantity may change, as well as the form of communication with the target cell of the assay. Immunofluorescence assays can complement the data and elucidate how these EVs interact with the target cell: membrane-membrane contact, fusion between membranes or internalization of these structures. These controls will allow a more accurate assessment of EV functionality and contribute to the understanding of their mechanisms of action. In addition, they can also open new research possibilities, such as the evaluation of the impact of EVs formed by the SUMO pathway in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, where cellular communication and protein accumulation play key roles in disease progression. Studies in the literature mention disease progression related to the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein and other factors still under investigation, such as changes in the protein profile and receptors of microglia.

DHRS7 Integrates NADP+ 1 /NADPH Redox Sensing with Inflammatory Li2 pid Signalling via the Oxoeicosanoid Pathway Yanan Ma1 , King Lam Hui1 , Yohannes A. Ambaw1 , Tobias C. Walther1,3 3 , Robert V. Farese, Jr1 , Miklos Lengyel1 , Zaza Gelashvili1,2 , Dajun Lu1 , and Philipp Niethammer1,4 Reviewer Team: Lucas Athayde, Rosangela Silva Santos, Sara Ventura. Summary Employing a variety of methodological approaches including structural modeling, phylogenetics, gene silencing, and mass spectrometry, the authors investigate 5- HEDH activity in A549 cells, an enzyme associated with lipid dehydrogenation that leads to 5-KETE formation. After confirming 5-HEDH activity through detection of its reversible oxidation products, 5-KETE and 5-HETE, the study proceeds with a gene-level investigation and screening for potential microsomal dehydrogenases involved in this lipid peroxidation. Additionally, the authors provide insights that may extend to other types of cells, as evidenced by functional studies in zebrafish. The authors uncover the role of DHRS7 in redox signaling, demonstrating its NADPH-dependent regulation of 5-KETE production. Unlike classical redox signaling based on thiol oxidation, they present DHRS7 as a redox-regulated enzyme that acts in 5-KETE biosynthesis, which is a highly novel and interesting mechanism. Under stress conditions, DHRS7 facilitates rapid inflammatory signaling and leukocyte recruitment through the 5-KETE pathway. Major Comments Identification of DHRS7 as a 5-HEDH Candidate The screening successfully identified DHRS7 as a candidate enzyme with 5- HEDH activity. LC-MS profiling of wild-type cell lines revealed increased 5-KETE levels in cells exposed to 5-HEDE and vice versa, with a stronger effect observed in 5-KETE accumulation. Surprisingly, 5-KETE production appeared to be favored under non-stress conditions. We would like to see a description of the data normalization to exclude the possibility that these differences arise from variations in cell viability, abundance, or any other experimental conditions. Alternative Pathways and Metabolic Compensation Another observation is the reduction in 5-KETE and 5-HETE levels in DHRS7 knockout cells, corroborating the proposed DHRS7 role. But the persistence of these metabolites in silenced cells even at lower concentrations is curious, which leads to a few hypotheses such as the activation of endogenous compensatory mechanisms and exogenous uptake of these metabolites from the media. To further investigate the origin of these residual metabolite levels, it is essential to quantify 5-KETE and 5-HETE in the culture medium to test if the cells' knockouts exposure to these lipids could explain these residual levels. To evaluate if these residual metabolites could have originated from endogenous mechanisms, a transcriptome analysis could be used to identify other redox-active enzymes differentially expressed that could exhibit potential 5-HEDH activity thereby compensating DHRS7 silencing. Subcellular Localization of DHRS7 The authors employed GFP-tagged DHRS7 constructs for subcellular localization and genetic complementation assays in DHRS7 KO A549 cells and zebrafish Dhrs7 KO models. This strategy successfully restored the wild-type phenotype, as evidenced by increased 5-HETE and 5-KETE levels upon treatment with precursors, corroborating the initial hypothesis of DRS7 as a 5-HEDH. However, the conclusion that DHRS7 localizes to microsomes lacks experimental validation, as no microsomal markers were used in confocal imaging. Indeed, cellular fractionation and Western blot assays indicate DHRS7 also localized in the nucleus, granules, and microsomes, but GFP fluorescence was absent in the nucleus. Given that the antibody used for Western blotting was available, it’s not clear why the authors did not employ an anti-DHRS7 antibody for immunofluorescence to precisely determine its intracellular distribution rather than relying on GFP-based localization assays. Kinetic Characterization of DHRS7 Activity The authors conducted enzymatic kinetics assays for DHRS7 and applied a Michaelis-Menten model for data fitting. However, the fitting shows clear deviations, with a notably low coefficient of determination (R²), suggesting that this model may not adequately describe DHRS7’s catalytic properties. In fact, a typical Michaelian model does not appear to fit the data distribution. To ensure that these discrepancies are not due to experimental artifacts, we recommend repeat the experiments performing additional replicates. Furthermore, considering the probable reversibility of 5-KETE conversion, alternative kinetic models that account for this factor should be explored. Minor Comments ● Lines 13-15: The authors state, ""As the DHRS7 (but not DHRS3) knockdown effect was consistent with 5-HEDH activity, we tested whether DHRS7 also promoted 5-KETE reduction. This was the case."" However, Figure S1D shows a reduction in 5-HETE, not 5-KETE. More clarification is needed. ● Cell Line Justification: The authors discuss DHRS7 expression in various contexts but do not justify their choice of A549 cells. Since none of the cited references mention DHRS7 expression in this line, a description of the rationale for model choice is necessary. ● Figure 1E: We recommend a dose-time response curve for DOX treatment to monitor DHRS7 expression levels. This would determine if DHRS7 expression remains at physiological levels or becomes supraphysiological, thereby ensuring that subsequent treatments also occur under physiological conditions. ● Figure 1F: We recommend a more clear description that these are cells lacking the DHRS7 construct to enhance reader understanding. ● Figure 2B: H₂O₂ is not a direct intermediate in the 5-HETE/5-KETE pathway, though it may indirectly influence it by activating 5-LOX, altering redox balance (NADP⁺/NADPH), and contributing to ferroptosis. The statement ""Lipid peroxidation stimulates 5-KETE production through DHRS7"" would be more robust if 5-LOX activity was assessed. We suggest a validation experiment: Treat DOX-induced DHRS7-expressing cells with H₂O₂ and measure markers of lipid peroxidation, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), isoprostanes, or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). This would confirm lipid peroxidation’s role in 5-KETE production. ● Figure 3D: Overexpression methodology in HEK cells is unclear. The knockout was achieved using CRISPR/Cas9, not shRNA. More clarification is needed on whether overexpression was introduced via a separate construct post-knockout, whether a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) or DOX-inducible system was used, or if overexpression was performed in a different cell line. ● Figure 4A: The heatmap visualization of metabolite concentrations was clear, but cluster analysis would provide more information related to the significance of observed alterations.",2025-03-24T20:40:02,,"Sara, Rosangela e Lucas",10.1101/2025.02.05.636725,DHRS7 Integrates NADP+/NADPH Redox Sensing with Inflammatory Lipid Signalling via the Oxoeicosanoid Pathway,"Yanan Ma, King Lam Hui, Yohannes A.

Very often the contig names and taxonomies do not match the taxonomy assigned by GTDB.

Since the publication of this genetically encoded sensor-based image analysis program (or GESIAP2.0) on bioRxiv in 2022 (Zheng et al., 2022), we have received extensive feedback from collaborators, colleagues, and reviewers—some of whom commented and reviewed our manuscripts that utilized GESIAP to analyze synaptic properties (Huang et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025b).  This feedback has been instrumental in identifying several limitations associated with GESIAP2.0.  Fortunately, these issues have been resolved in the latest version, GESIAP3.0, which incorporates algorithms independently developed by Roger Zhu and colleagues at Zhejiang University (Zhu et al., 2024). One limitation of GESIAP2.0 concerns the initial movement correction procedure. GESIAP2.0 employs translational (or affine) alignment algorithms to correct movements in fluorescence signals collected from ex vivo imaging experiments (Zheng et al., 2022).  While effective for minor displacements, this method struggles with larger movements, leading to the exclusion of many cells from analysis.  GESIAP3.0 incorporates an advanced non-rigid movement correction algorithm that corrects complex displacements in behaving animals, as well as small movements in ex vivo experiments (Zhu et al., 2024).  Recent tests show that this algorithm eliminates the need for alignment, improving the robustness and accuracy of the image analysis. Both GESAIP2.0 (Zheng et al., 2022) and GESAIP3.0 (Zhu et al., 2024) utilize the Landweber deconvolution procedure (Sage et al., 2017), a published method that enhances microscopic image quality by ""reassigning"" detected photons to their original emitting locations in both ex vivo and in vivo experiments. Another notable limitation of GESIAP2.0 is the denoising procedure.  Initially, GESIAP2.0 used a non-synaptic function to fit fluorescence responses (Zheng et al., 2022). This method proved ineffective in accurately identifying key parameters of fluorescence responses, including latency and peak.  This method often failed to detect small fluorescence responses from noise background, resulting in an underestimation of releasing synapses (Zheng et al., 2022).  Roger Zhu later introduced a double-exponential synaptic function to improve fitting, but its high computational demands prevented its application to all data in the preprint (Zheng et al., 2022).  In GESIAP3.0, Roger Zhu and his Zhejiang University team implemented a least-squares non-linear optimization using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to fit double-exponential synaptic function (Zhu et al., 2024).  This  method combines gradient descent with the Gauss-Newton method (Moré, 2006; Gavin, 2019), fitting both the rise and decay phases of synaptic responses to optimize parameter regression.  Biological constraints based on the response properties of genetically encoded sensors (e.g., (Borden et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2021)) were also incorporated to restrict parameter ranges, improving both speed and accuracy. The final step in GESIAP2.0 is flawed (Zheng et al., 2022).  To amplify small signals extracted during denoising, baseline responses are arbitrarily subtracted, introducing random variations in the fluorescence responses.  In contrast, GESIAP3.0 improves small signal extraction using double-exponential synaptic function fitting (Zhu et al., 2024).  When necessary, it further reduces residual noise with a bilateral non-linear filter (Tomasi and Manduchi, 1998), enhancing image clarity without inflating fluorescence ΔF/F0 values. In summary, GESIAP2.0 (Zheng et al., 2022) provides further proof-of-principle that nanoscopic sensor-based functional imaging analysis can dissect synaptic properties of transmission across various transmitters, cell types, and animal species (cf. (Zhu et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021)).  This analysis also implies both shared patterns and a diverse range of presynaptic release dynamics that contribute to neuromodulation.  However, code defects in GESIAP2.0 lead to inaccurate estimates of synaptic properties, limiting its ability to address fundamental biological questions.  Our new manuscripts show that synaptic properties calculated using GESIAP3.0 (Huang et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025b) differ significantly from those obtained with GESIAP2.0 and align closely with results from independent approaches.  Hence, we encourage readers to contact the Zhejiang University team for potential collaborations and access to the GESIAP3.0 code. - J.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.09.566486v1#comment-6669300561,biorxivstage,0,"There are two key conclusions in this paper: 1) an ancestral origin of house mice from the Indo-Pakistan region and 2) incomplete lineage sorting for the observed alle sharing between contemporary populations. Both conclusions are not sufficiently supported, given the current published evidence. I suggest that the authors carefully study this previous evidence and adjust their conclusions accordingly. 1. Origin of the house mouse radiation To trace the region of origin based on population genetic data, requires sufficient sampling of the relevant regions and comparable sample structures. The broadest samplings available to date that address the question of the origin are published in (Afzali, 2024; Hardouin et al., 2015). They show a high diversity of lineages in Iran and a complex history of populations across Asia. Lawal and Dumont include only one population from Iran, but do not capture the full diversity that is already known from there. Further, some of the population samples used by Lawal and Dumont represent sampling from local regions, while others are from broad regions (PAK and IND). Given the known deme structure in mice (Linnenbrink, Teschke, Montero, Vallier, & Tautz, 2018), the broad samplings of PAK and IND may cover different lineages that should not be lumped into a single one. This issue would need a deeper attention in the overall analysis. 2. Incomplete lineage sorting instead of introgression This issue has been addressed in a large number of papers. All of these authors have carefully evaluated the two alternatives. The analysis presented by Lawal and Dumont is too superficial to make a strong claim that runs contrary to all of these previous data and analysis. Probably the strongest argument against incomplete lineage sorting is the existence of large introgressed haplotypes that segregate in the different subspecies and species and that were found to be subject to adaptive introgression (Song et al., 2011; Staubach et al., 2012). Several of such regions have subsequently been studied in detail and the long haplotype structures were confirmed, e.g. in (Banker, Bonhomme, & Nachman, 2022; Hasenkamp, Solomon, & Tautz, 2015; Linnenbrink, Ullrich, McConnell, & Tautz, 2020). Neither incomplete lineage sorting, nor long-term balancing selection can explain the existence of such long introgressed haplotypes, since they would be broken up by recombination over time. Note that although the mouse lineage divergence times seem ""shallow"" with being shorter than 0.5 Million years, the number of generations is actually high, given the short generation times. To suggest that incomplete lineage sorting is a possible explanation for the shared alleles would require to show with appropriate simulations that long haplotypes could be retained over hundreds of thousands of generations without breaking them up. Such simulations have been extensively used for the comparisons between Neandertals and humans, where introgression at specific loci is distinguished from ILS by comparing expected haplotype lengths.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.25.614899v1#comment-6667136200,biorxivstage,0,"Dear Authors, Thank you for sharing your insightful work, ""In Silico Engineering of Stable siRNA Lipid Nanoparticles: Exploring the Impact of Ionizable Lipid Concentrations for Enhanced Formulation Stability."" Your study makes an important contribution to the field of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) research by highlighting the role of ionizable lipid concentrations in siRNA encapsulation and stability. The use of coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of LNP formation, which is particularly valuable for optimizing RNA-based drug delivery systems. Summary This study examines how neutral and positive ionizable lipids influence LNP stability and siRNA encapsulation efficiency. The findings indicate that LNPs with positive ionizable lipids encapsulate siRNA more effectively than those with neutral lipids, likely due to their integration with phospholipids and the prevention of siRNA escape. Interestingly, low and medium concentrations of both neutral and positive DLKC2 showed better compartment formation and encapsulation efficiency compared to high concentrations. Additionally, neutral lipids exhibited greater aggregation, which could impact LNP stability. Introduction Your introduction effectively establishes the relevance of this study by situating it within the broader context of LNP research. The discussion of existing challenges in siRNA delivery and the role of lipid composition is well-articulated. However, further elaboration on how your study builds upon previous experimental findings could help connect computational insights with practical applications. Results The figures and data presentation generally support your conclusions. Figure 4, which illustrates LNP compartment formation at different lipid concentrations, is particularly valuable in showing how high concentrations lead to instability. We do think that some quantitative metrics such as bilayer thickness, lipid density, or compartment size would enhance the strength of these findings. Additionally, since water is omitted from the visualizations for clarity, we think it would be beneficial to include a figure that shows water so we can visualize the hydration effects and lipid-water interactions. Discussion Your discussion effectively compares findings with prior studies, reinforcing that positive ionizable lipids enhance siRNA encapsulation and that lipid aggregation in neutral systems may reduce stability. While you mention previous molecular dynamics studies (e.g., Paloncýová et al. and Trollmann & Böckmann), we feel a more direct comparison of numerical data and trends from these works would further contextualize your results. Additionally, discussing potential experimental validation techniques (e.g., cryogenic electron microscopy or encapsulation efficiency assays) could provide future directions for integrating simulations with laboratory-based studies. However, that is just our opinion as we do understand that this study takes on a more computational approach and is still very impactful. Suggestions for Improvement 1.	Expand quantitative analysis in Figure 4 by including measurements of bilayer thickness, lipid density, and compartment size to provide a more rigorous validation of LNP stability. 2.	Clarify the role of hydration in lipid-water interactions since water was omitted in visualizations. 3.	Strengthen comparisons with previous molecular dynamics and experimental studies by integrating direct numerical contrasts. 4.	Discuss potential experimental validation approaches that could complement your computational findings and enhance their real-world applicability. Final Thoughts Overall, this paper presents a well-structured and valuable contribution to siRNA delivery research. With minor refinements in quantitative analysis, literature comparisons, and discussion of experimental validation, the study could be even more impactful. Thank you for your efforts in advancing the field of LNP-based RNA therapeutics!

This works sets the foundation for future studies on gene regulation and host-pathogen interactions in Cx. tarsalis, a major vector of West Nile Virus (WNV). While the methodology is robust and the findings are compelling, the paper would benefit from some minor revisions to strengthen data presentation, clarify experimental choices, and align its conclusions more closely with the results. Introduction: The introduction frames the importance of miRNA research in Cx. tarsalis well, particularly in the context of understanding its role as a vector for WNV. However, the title of the paper may be misleading since the findings do not directly link the identified miRNAs to WNV vectoring. Reframing the title and introduction to focus on the broader importance of miRNA characterization in Cx. tarsal without overemphasizing the WNV connection would improve clarity and prevent misalignment between the study’s scope and its claims. Results: The results section presents a comprehensive dataset of miRNAs identified through computational comparison with other mosquito species and validated using RT-qPCR. The discovery of novel miRNAs and the observed isomiR variations are particularly noteworthy, with the predominance of 3’ end insertions being a finding of potential significance in gene regulation. That said, clearer justification for the selection of the 10 miRNAs validated by qPCR would strengthen the interpretability of the results. Discussion: The discussion effectively places the study’s findings within the broader context of existing research on mosquito miRNAs and draws meaningful comparisons with other species like Aedes albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The evolutionary conservation of miR-184 and the identification of unique miRNAs in Cx. tarsalis offer valuable insights. However, the paper would benefit from further discussion on the functional implications of these miRNAs, particularly their potential roles in development, immunity, and host-pathogen interactions. Additionally, the observed differences in miRNA expression between cell lines and whole organisms raise important questions that warrant more exploration. Suggestions: 1.	Revise the title to better reflect the study’s current findings and avoid overemphasizing WNV. 2.	Clarify the rationale behind the selection of the 10 miRNAs for qPCR validation. 3.	Expand the discussion on the functional roles of the identified miRNAs and their potential involvement in host-pathogen interactions. 4.	Address the limitations more explicitly, such as the reliance on a single genome assembly, the lack of data from different mosquito life stages and tissues, and the absence of additional validation methods like Northern blot. 5.	Consider including a statistical analysis to highlight differences in miRNA expression between cell lines and whole organisms. 6.	Discuss the potential influence of feeding behavior on gene expression and its relevance to vector competence.",2025-03-10T04:17:10,disqus_zNEHHjaT83,Young Cho,10.1101/2021.09.23.461553,Identification of microRNAs in the West Nile virus vector Culex tarsalis,"Sultan Asad, Ahmed M.

We will correct the reference using their final published version: Nat Commun. 2023 Dec 8;14(1):8123.  In addition, Giotto Suite also provides an internal tool for alignment that is based on an affine transform using manually selected landmarks. This tool is described in the updated tutorial. Also, we have made many other updates to the Giotto Suite package since this post. Please check out the giottosuite.com website for the latest. Hope this is useful.

It's not Biosyn Corporation ( http://biosyncorp.com), as you wrote, but rather Bio-Synthesis ( http://biosyn.com). Moreover, in the TSO sequence: ""/5Biosg/"" is the acronym used by IDT for a 5' biotin. The ""g"" has nothing to do with deoxyguanosine (G), but you write in the paper ""5BiosG/"" and this can be confusing. The standard 10x TSO sequence is, in fact: 5’-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACATrGrGrG-3’ so no G at the 5' (like there was never a G at the 5' of the SMART-seq oligo, from which 10x took their sequence). The code for biotin at Biosyn is [Btn] (standard C6 spacer, which I assume is the one you mean here).",2025-03-04T21:05:38,simonepicelli,Simone Picelli,10.1101/2025.02.22.639662,Multi-platform evaluation and optimization of single-cell RNA isoform sequencing,"James T.
