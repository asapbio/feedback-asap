The ones found up to now change some replication rates slightly (i.e. from 15-45% to 19-45% in the primary analysis) but do not make a meaningful difference in the article's conclusions. This, however, has raised concerns that our original data checking process (which was performed asynchronously) was likely suboptimal. We have thus decided to hold off revision of the preprint and submission to a journal until we have discussed each experiment individually with the labs that replicated it, in order to check the original data and clear up any doubts. In the meantime, we will also add this warning note to the first page of the preprint. This process should be concluded in early December, when a revised preprint should be expected. In the meantime, keep in mind that the results in the final version are bound to present minor changes when compared to those in this version.",2025-09-29T14:52:13,olavoamaral,Olavo Amaral,,,,

The team demonstrates, for the first time, that genome language models (Evo 1 & Evo 2) can transcend protein- or circuit-level design and generate complete, viable phage genomes with evolutionary novelty. What stands out to me as someone deeply engaged in AI-driven drug discovery and computational biology is the rigorous integration of multi-layered constraints: from sequence quality, gene architecture, and tropism specificity, to evolutionary diversification. Such hierarchical filtering mirrors the multi-stage AI pipelines we build for therapeutic design, where generative creativity must always be balanced by biological feasibility. Equally impressive is the experimental validation: 16 fully functional phages synthesized from ∼300 AI-generated genomes, some with faster lysis kinetics and higher competitive fitness than the natural ΦX174. The ability of a cocktail of these phages to rapidly overcome bacterial resistance underscores how AI-guided genomic exploration can access adaptive solutions beyond natural evolution—a principle that could redefine both antimicrobial strategies and synthetic biology at large . On a broader horizon, this work offers a blueprint for steerable, constraint-driven genome design. Much like our own efforts in applying generative AI to novel small-molecule scaffolds for resistant cancer targets, this study exemplifies how language-model-based frameworks can capture the hidden rules of evolution and recompose them into functional biological systems. The implications span from phage therapy to programmable synthetic organisms. Congratulations to the authors for pushing the frontier of generative biology—this is not just phage design, but a proof-of-principle for the next era of genome-scale AI-driven engineering.",2025-09-29T13:06:57,disqus_awfLwDEvYQ,Mohd Sufiyan Khan,,,,

If we need ~200 characters for a good estimate of the relationships between 20 tips, this makes me wonder whether we should be using a 10:1 ratio as a rule of thumb.  If we’re interested in the relationships between 20 taxa, and we can only score 100 characters, my intuition says that including more taxa would still improve our estimate of the relationships between the 20 taxa of interest, even if the placement of the ‘extra’ taxa is uncertain.  I’d be interested to know whether your study has any suggestions here. I also wonder whether you tried using the Clustering Information Distance alongside the Robinson–Foulds, as the biases with the RF distance seem like they could be particularly problematic in a study such as this, where the misplacement of a single taxon could be a likely event (see Smith 2020, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa614).  On a similar vein, I wonder whether it would be more meaningful to take the mean distance between trees in the posterior distribution and the true tree, rather than selecting a single tree – there is no guarantee that the MAP tree is representative of the posterior distribution (though potentially some tree space analysis could support the assumption that it is).  You might also consider verifying that the ESS of your tree topologies is at an acceptable level (e.g. with https://github.com/afmagee/treess), to be confident that the topologies – not just the estimates of other model parameters – have converged.",2025-09-29T10:48:53,PalaeoSmith,Martin R.

If you are not yet aware of it, you may be interested in our paper from several years ago: https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(23)00244-2. Basically, although the moment-based estimates are useful (and almost mandatory for inference over non-iid samples), it is also relatively straightforward to compute the full likelihoods by quadrature. As the cells within a cell type are assumed iid here, this is more or less compatible with the framework. The low-beta regime can also be represented as a two-state model with bursty (and potentially leaky) expression in the active state, slightly more straightforward to solve numerically. For the connection to ATAC, please see https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.110.064405. The same model is straightforward to generalize to some latent regulator or a coupled series thereof (although the best way to define such coupling is still obscure). The joint modeling of these quantities is a somewhat underexplored problem. One key issue we raise in the PRE paper is that noise modeling for ATAC is unusually challenging. There are, of course, other challenges, like the slightly non-iid nature of measurements across supposedly homogeneous cells (""cell size"" effects) and the usual DNA/gene mapping issues: how should one map a peak to a particular gene? How should one represent the relationship between multiple peaks that all ostensibly control or overlap a single gene? It is exciting to see people pursuing mechanistic approaches for this  problem, and I look forward to future work.",2025-09-23T20:28:30,gennadygorin,Gennady Gorin,,,,

To fully appreciate the efficiency of using ARGs alleles to predict host pathogens, I think it would be useful to add as suppl. data a table summarizing for each ARG in your database, how many allele are unique to a single pathogenic species, or shared by 2, 3, 4, and let's say 5 or more species. Indeed, when looking at the unclassified kmers from your validation test in your suppl. data, it seems that most mobile genes of public health concern are in the list (most ESBL and carbapenemases, mcr1, all tetracycline genes, etc.). Second, it is not clear, when a gene is categorized as 'Genomic origin', whether it is a mutation of an intrinsic gene or whether it is located on integrative elements ICE or IMEs.

The build-test workflow is clearly described, and the recovery of infectious particles provides a strong experimental anchor for the computational design story. This is a great demonstration of what is currently feasible for whole-genome phage engineering. However, it misses a major opportunity to contextualize the generative model performance with explicit baselines. This makes it difficult to assess whether there is a true advance due to the ability of the generative model to move in sequence space with success rates (~16/300) above alternative (lightweight) models. Moreover, the sequence space explored here appears to stay close to known natural sequences, so it is hard to appreciate how the generative model adds novelty beyond proximity to existing genomes. Side-by-side comparisons against simple alternatives (for example a consensus design, frame-preserving randomization under GC and codon constraints, ancestral reconstruction, or family statistical models such as direct coupling analysis) would clarify whether the model improves assembly success or shifts resistance outcomes. Recent studies provide useful templates for such “null model” panels, see OpenCRISPR Figure 3E ( https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12422970/), and ProGen Lysozymes Figure S10 ( https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10400306/) for evaluating LLM-generation of proteins. Including analogous baselines here, with success rates and resistance readouts reported for each, would make the impact of this contribution and generality of this approach unmistakable.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.08.674935v1#comment-6771776887,biorxivstage,1,"I am impressed by this work. I have a few comments, questions and suggestions. Although I used the imperative mood in some sentences, never feel obliged to do them. They are just some ideas. (Being a non-native speaker of English, my comments seem to sound too harsh sometimes) 1. You mentioned ""solely using data at high spatial frequencies"" and ""use data only at high spatial frequencies"". This sounds as if you did not use low frequency signals but I guess CryoSPARC's initial resolution and maximum resolution parameters only set the high resolution cutoff, not the low resolution cutoff. In other words, if you use ""Initial resolution 5 Å, maximum resolution 2.3 Å"", it uses DC to 5 Å in early iterations and gradually increases the high resolution cutoff until it reaches DC to 2.3 Å in the last iterations. Am I wrong? 2. You mentioned that ""other approaches that we and others have tried produced maps with no interpretable high resolution structural features"" and ""other parameters often converged on false minima"". Could you please describe what was tried and unsuccessful? For example, in all cases, you set ""center structures in real space OFF"". Was this essential? ""Enforce non-negativity"" was TRUE for calmodulin, FALSE for Hb-dimer and Aca2-RNA and not mentioned for iPKAc. Again, were these choices critical? You used ""a beta version of CryoSPARC v5, which has an option to apply a soft spherical mask to the ab initio volume at each iteration"". Was this new masking feature essential for success? 3. Your ""final resolution"" in the ab initio jobs (but why is it called ""maximum resolution"" for iPKAc?) is higher (i.e. numerically smaller) than the final, refined resolution. Was this necessary? What is the minimum (i.e. numerically largest) resolution necessary for success in each case? If you can solve the structure using lower resolutions for alignment, you can get reasonable resolution estimates without gold-standard (GS) splits in cisTEM's way. 4. In general, refinement fails when the starting (reference) model is too bad beyond the radius of convergence and/or when individual particles are too noisy to be aligned. Of course, these two are not independent; noisier particles can be aligned with a better reference. Regularization (e.g. using GSFSC or non-uniform refinement) and injection of prior information (e.g. Blush) improve the radius of convergence by making the energy landscape of the target function smoother. It would be interesting to see which problem (bad initial model or noisy alignment) hampered structure solution in these cases. 4.1. You briefly mentioned refinement trials using HR-HAIR maps as the initial reference. It would be interesting to do this more systematically. Take a HA-HAIR map, low pass filter it at various resolutions and perform refinement with global search. When does it succeed? Is the resolution different from the minimum resolution required for ab initio jobs (point 3 above). If they are very different, regularization by GSFSC might be too strong. Another possibility is that the loss of SNR in half 1 reference and half 2 reference relative to the full reference made alignment too hard. When GSFSC was proposed, this effect was said to be negligible (and overcome by a better regularization), but it might make a critical difference for extremely difficult cases like this. 4.2. It is also worth testing marginalization over poses. Does it help, or make it worse? 4.3. For some datasets, you used only a subset of the EMPIAR entry. This gives you a good chance to perform the test 4.1 more rigorously. Perform HA-HAIR on particles from the first X movies. Then perform refinement tests on particles from the remaining movies. If ab initio succeds but global search refinement fails with N particles, doesglobal search refinement succeed with 2N particles? If so, the SNR reduction due to GS split was the culprit. 5. Another idea to assess the resolution when the GSFSC is unavailable is as follows. Take a non-GS HR-HAIR map and low pass filter it to say 3.3 Å. Refine an atomic model against it. Calculate the map-model FSC on the original, non-low pass filtered map. Because an atomic model refined to 3.3 Å has predictive power beyond 3.3 Å, it can be used to gauge whether the map contains chemically sensible information beyond 3.3 Å. (You should first verify this strategy on maps with known GS resolution) Sorry for my lengthy and scattered comment. I am still thinking a better way to investigate this interesting observation and validate the resolution and haven't consolidated my thoughts fully. I just wrote what I have so far. I hope at least some of the above is useful for your investigation.",2025-09-22T13:17:23,disqus_2p28leFhmb,Takanori Nakane,,,,

I used this paper to practice peer review with my MSc Wildlife Conservation students. I thought the peer review process could be helpful, therefore I have copied the review we created below: This study aimed to quantify the temporal dynamics of chytrid infection in Yosemite toads, with a particular focus on changes in infection dynamics before and after the first hibernation period in metamorphs. The authors hypothesized that changes in physiology and/or exposure associated with hibernation could alter pathogen infection rates and growth. To test this, they sampled first-year metamorphs across six alpine meadows before and after their first hibernation. They also sampled tadpoles, juveniles, and adults during the same pre-hibernation period to explore infection patterns across age classes, although sample sizes for tadpoles and adults were relatively small, and these cohorts were not sampled after hibernation. The authors found that tadpoles were free of infection, whereas infection prevalence increased to about 20% in first-year metamorphs before hibernation and then rose sharply to over 90% after hibernation. Infection prevalence and intensity remained high the following summer. They suggest this striking increase is linked to hibernation itself, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Two hypotheses are brought up in the discussion: (1) metamorphs may already be exposed prior to hibernation, but immune suppression during hibernation allows pathogen proliferation to detectable levels, or (2) metamorphs enter hibernation chytrid-free and become infected during hibernation. Notably, no effects of infection on morbidity were detected, suggesting Yosemite toads may act as asymptomatic carriers. Overall, I found the study nicely written, interesting and relatively well designed, with some exceptions. The methods are largely appropriate for the central question of whether hibernation in first-year metamorphs contributes to chytrid persistence in this population. The inclusion of a conceptual figure of the study design was particularly helpful. I have no major concerns regarding the methodology. That said, I did find parts of the manuscript confusing and have several suggestions for improvement. My primary conceptual criticism is that the results apply only to first-year metamorphs. To test more robustly whether hibernation itself drives changes in infection dynamics, it would have been valuable to examine adults or even other nearby species that do not hibernate (although I understand that these would be subject to different climates). Including these comparisons would strengthen the case that hibernation per se influences infection prevalence. As it stands, the study convincingly demonstrates a link between dormancy and infection dynamics in metamorphs, but not necessarily beyond this cohort. I encourage the authors to specify this in the abstract and to emphasize that the mechanisms remain unresolved. I also found the introdiction quite confusingly structured and did not fully outline what is known from previous studies or provdie enough information on the ecology of the study species and why it makes a good model system to test these questions. I have more detailed comments on the introduction below. Section-Specific Comments: Introduction The introduction clearly states the study’s aims but would benefit from more detailed context on the current state of knowledge. Summarizing prior studies in greater depth - for example, Kasler et al. (2023), which is mentioned in the discussion but not the introduction - would help the reader understand the state of the knowledge and where the gap or conflicting evidence arises. At present, the introduction focuses too heavily on highlighting the results, while the rationale, state of the field, and knowledge gaps are underdeveloped. A bit more information on the ecology of Yosemite toads would also be helpful. For instance: Can chytrid transmission occur during hibernation? Do toads hibernate individually or communally? Why is this species particularly interesting for examining infection dynamics beyond the fact that it hibernates? The authors also assume that everyone knows about chytrid – the fact that is causes huge population declines and extinctions, and any known factors on its spread and persistence, are not even mentioned. The structure of the introduction is somewhat disjointed, with results and knowledge gaps raised in multiple places rather than in a logical sequence. I suggest beginning the introduction with chytrid fungus (or emerging fungal pathogens more generally), followed by discussion of seasonal and life-history drivers of infection. Dormancy could then be introduced as a potentially important factor early on – but starting with dormancy when this paper is fundamentally about understanding drivers of chytrid infection and maintenance is possibly confusing to some. Notably, the authors argue that their results “challenge current thinking about seasons,” yet the introduction contains little background on known seasonal effects on chytrid dynamics. Providing this context would make their justifications and interpretation more compelling. Finally, sample sizes are difficult to find in the text. Including these in Figure 1 and briefly outlining the study design at the end of the introduction would improve clarity on methods. Overall, a thorough restructuring and expansion of the introduction would make it more informative and logically ordered. Methods I had questions about the modelling framework. Why were pre- and post-hibernation cohorts analyzed separately? Would a zero-inflated model have been more appropriate for intensity data, and were these approaches considered? Presenting model outputs and explanatory power in a supplementary table would improve transparency. Additionally, it would help to explain why juveniles and adults were only sampled at a single meadow and time point, rather than following the same design as metamorphs. Clarifying these decisions would improve understanding of the study’s scope and limitations. Results It is unclear why only two figures are presented in the main text, with the remainder in the Supplementary Materials. Some of the supplementary data would be valuable in the main body, ideally integrated into a single figure that allows direct comparison across life stages and survey periods. Figure 3 should include sample sizes, as in Figure 2. It is also unclear why tadpoles are not represented in this figure, given their relevance to the infection trajectory. Discussion Much of the contextual information in the discussion would be better placed in the introduction (e.g., references such as Kasler et al. that address similar questions). This shift would allow the discussion to focus more sharply on how this study advances understanding and to highlight its limitations (e.g., small adult sample sizes, lack of non-hibernating species for comparison). Supp Materials Note that zeros are missing in one of the intensity figures, and that the order of the meadow sites is not always matching across figures.",2025-09-19T09:29:01,alicerisely,Alice Risely,,,,

We recommend this version to the reader, precisely because it incorporates in part the perspectives provided by Dr. Langer.  In general, we hope to have contributed to the literature not a rebuttal of the work of others, but a clear exegesis of what we consider to be a valid in cellula system in which to test PAC1 antagonists destined for use in vivo, and potentially in the clinic. When in cellula (or in vitro) systems provide disparate data about the efficacy of a given agonist or antagonist, we believe it falls to specialist practitioners in the field (in the case of PACAP antagonist discovery, we include ourselves) to attempt to resolve contradictory findings, since this should ultimately lead to more predictive assays, and more rationale and effective drug development going forward. It is important to understand that the final goal is to establish compound efficacy in vivo, It is important to understand that the ultimate goal is to establish compound efficacy in vivo. Therefore, we prefer not to apply artificial stress conditions to cells in order to force a compound to display any antagonist effect. We also emphasize the importance of including an antagonist control (such as P6-38 or M65) in any testing system to properly validate the compound. In that regard, workflow for development of PAC1 antagonist SMOLs for therapeutic effect (see, for example, the recently published report by Shintani et al. about PA-[915] as a potential antidepressant Molecular Psychiatry; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03209-4) might benefit from inclusion of in vivo target engagement models, such as phenocopying drug effect with regiospecific PAC1 knockout animal models, to more firmly establish the mechanism of in vivo actions of putative PAC1 SMOL antagonist compounds.

Major Points: The limited effect of thermodynamics: While I might not have a clear understanding of evolutionary changes, especially with respect to this study, I think that thermodynamics might not be the only major factor. Although one of the main aims is situated around the entropy-enthalpy trade-offs as classified using the properties that constitute the free energy of binding calculations. I suggest that thermodynamics might not be contributing solely to this characteristic observed The effects of kinetics, which are not addressed, might have some contribution, probably of equal magnitude with thermodynamics contributions We agree that ligand recognition and transcriptional regulation can be influenced by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors, and that equilibrium measurements alone do not capture the full dynamic picture. In this work, our mechanistic analysis is framed specifically in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics obtained from ITC.  While kinetics and thermodynamics are linked, the equilibrium measurements presented here do not resolve the kassociation and kdissociation rates separately. Our conclusions pertain to the thermodynamic shift observed along the reconstructed trajectory. We agree that it would be valuable in future work to determine whether ligand association/dissociation kinetics vary with the thermodynamic driving force along this trajectory. Limited evolutionary trajectory: Since the family is said to have existed for approximately 3 billion years, analyzing thermodynamic properties of just 4 ancestors and an extant Lacl might be speculative rather than factual about the whole family We acknowledge that the LGF is ancient and that this study examines only four reconstructed ancestors along a single trajectory plus extant LacI. Our aim is not to make claims about the entire family’s history, but to characterise in detail the thermodynamic and structural transition along one evolutionary path. The reconstructed sequences for Anc1 to Anc4 had high posterior probabilities and the trajectory spans major sequence and functional changes within the clade, linking structural features to changes in binding thermodynamics. Future work could extend the approach to additional nodes or other ancestors in this trajectory or clade to understand how general these thermodynamic shifts are across the full diversity of LGF regulators. Minor point: Overall, the paper was well written, but one misspelling that caught my attention is the paragraph on page 14 below Figure 5 caption, in the last sentence. “It should be noted that he apo and d-fucose....” where ‘he’ should be ‘the’ We apologise for this error, and thank the reviewer for their comment. We will correct this error in future versions.

We agree that the sign and magnitude of dCp directly influence how the enthalpic and entropic components change with temperature. Given the higher thermal stability we see for Anc1 and Anc2, the dCp values for these ancs would tell us how their thermodynamics change with temperature, and whether the balance between entropy and enthalpy seen at 25 ºC would be the same or different in potentially ancient hot environments. In this study, our ITC experiments were performed at 25 °C to ensure comparability of dH, -TdS, and dG across reconstructed nodes and ligands under identical conditions. Determining dCp would mean performing ITC series with repeats at multiple temperatures for each protein-ligand pair, which was beyond the scope of this work but we agree would be valuable and insightful for future investigations.",2025-09-17T05:58:29,rosiegeorgelin,Rosie Georgelin,,,,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.23.644840v2#comment-6769205781,biorxivstage,2,"Reply from the authors, Rosie Georgelin and Colin Jackson: We thank CJ, Galen, and James for their thoughtful, constructive, and high-quality feedback. Many of these suggestions will be incorporated into a future version of this manuscript. We address each point in detail below: Major points Point 1. The authors propose that Anc1 has a spatial redistribution of entropy away from the ligand binding site to the distal loops to compensate for the loss of conformational entropy upon binding. Can they test this hypothesis by truncating or stabilizing (by point mutation) the loops? Despite a cooler earth at present, there are still organisms that live at hot temperatures. Do the extent orthologues in these organisms show entropically driven binding? Do the ancestors reported in this function as transcription factors at higher temperatures? Can the authors propose an experiment to test this? It’s interesting that Anc1 is the most thermally stable of the TF’s (based on the hypothesized relationship between earth temperature and protein thermal stability) yet the structure suggests it’s the most disordered compared to Anc4. Can the authors comment on how this fits within their proposed model? Point 1. We agree that truncating or stabilising the mobile loops that gain flexibility upon ligand binding could be a useful way to probe spatial entropic redistribution. We also note the caveats that such edits can alter pocket geometry, hydration, or long-range allostery, so any dH/-TdS shifts might reflect changed interactions rather than reduced flexibility per se. Regarding temperature, the LGF phylogeny includes thermophilic phyla, but their thermodynamics have not yet been measured. While higher temperature scales -TdS and can amplify entropy-driven modes like Anc1 at 25 °C, this is not exhaustive across thermophiles: many thermophilic proteins are pre-rigidified and use pre-organised polar contacts and ordered waters, which keep dS small or negative while maintaining favourable dH. Consistent with prior observations that extant and ancestral thermophilicity need not be mechanistically identical (Hobbs et al., 2012, MBE, DOI:10.1093/molbev/msr253), we therefore present the Anc1-Anc4 trajectory as a sequential thermodynamic trend that highlights a potentially important role for thermodynamics in protein evolution; discussion of ancient high temperatures is offered as a possible explanation for the observed pattern, not a blanket rule for all high-temperature proteins. Further exploration of the thermodynamic behaviour of extant thermophiles in this family, were highlighted in review and so we plan to do some experimental work to probe these points of interest. As to function at higher temperatures, the in vivo assays were incubated at 37 °C and indicate continued transcriptional regulation by the TFs at that temperature, while ITC was conducted at 25 °C to provide a consistent comparison window for binding thermodynamics. A natural extension could be ITC across a temperature series up toward the Tₘ values of the ancestral TFs, including above 37 °C, although this would not be a trivial undertaking. The outcomes of dCp calculations would be interesting, we don’t believe it would affect the interpretation of our conclusions. Finally, while we recognise the apparent tension between Anc1’s high melting temperature from DSF/CD and its open, flexible structure; we do not see these as contradictory. A high Tm is compatible with a strong core and key secondary structures coexisting with retained flexibility distal to the binding site. Indeed, Anc1’s crystal structure shows one highly ordered domain and one more disordered domain. Global stability from thermal unfolding does not directly reflect on local flexibility, and flexible loops or mobile domains can persist in proteins that resist complete unfolding (Liu et al., 2018, PNAS, DOI:10.1073/pnas.1807473115; Wintrode et al., 2003, JMB, DOI:10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00147-5). Point 2. The possibility that ancestral reconstruction artificially stabilizes proteins has been acknowledged in the literature (e.g. PMID 27413048). Are the authors concerned that the changes in stability observed in their work might be due to the stabilizing effect of consensus mutations? Point 2. We agree that literature has shown ASR can introduce stabilising mutations into proteins, with ancestors sometimes but not always (Hart et al, 2014, PLOS Biology, DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001994), exhibiting higher melting temperatures than extant proteins, and some good reviews (Wheeler, 2016, Curr Opin Struc Bio, DOI: 10.1016/j.sbi.2016.05.015) explore this deeper than we will here. However, literature does not show similar promotion of  entropic binding in the ancestrally designed  proteins. If the increased thermal stability in our ancestral TFs is due to bias by ASR design methods, it is coupled with a similar correlated increase in entropic contribution. We only hypothesise that these two characteristics (Tm and dS) are related, due to this correlation. Point 3. The authors focus on the LBD of the LGF family for structural studies and point out that Anc1 (the most distant ancestor) exhibits a greater level of disorder compared to the most recent ancestor Anc4. Is this level of disorder also expected to occur in the DNA binding domain or is it disorder unique to the LBD? In other words, does evolution only act on one domain of this family or are there correlated changes to the DBD as well (allosteric mechanism)? Point 3. We didn’t focus on the DNA-binding domains in this paper, except to note that they still function allosterically in vivo and are able to bind/unbind to LacOsym operator. A related paper on the same phylogenetic tree of ancestral TFs ( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2024.03.002) shows that the DNA-binding domain (DBD) is a highly rugged evolutionary landscape, likely because ruggedness minimizes promiscuity/crosstalk in gene regulation. Binary on/off specificity avoids off-target regulation as families diverge. This is less critical in the development of ligand specificity, which can evolve over a much smoother evolutionary landscape with less dire consequences for off-target binding when compared to the genetic regulation inferred by the DBD. Although the DBD wasn’t the focus of our structural study, we agree that the differences in LBD vs DBD evolutionary mechanism is very compelling. Point 4. It’s interesting that D-fucose binding was largely lost by Anc2 (or not tested?), can the authors provide a structural reason for that similar to their analysis with Anc4? Further, with respect to Figure 4 can authors show (perhaps just an AlphaFold prediction) what the composition of the substrate binding site looks like between each ancestor? Was there a sudden change between Anc1 and Anc2 in composition or was it more gradual (also given the D-fucose binding is almost lost between Anc1 and Anc2 - again was that actually tested)? Point 4. In the high-throughput screen (using DSF to assay the Anc TFs against a library of small molecules) we found no detectable ligand stabilisation by d-fucose to Anc2. We in fact found no significant stabilisation by any of the tested small molecules, particularly compared to the strong responses seen in the other Ancs. We did still test d-fucose using ITC against all Ancs 1-4, and in the in vivo testing too. We found Anc2 response to d-fucose was not significantly different to the sucrose negative control in the in vivo tests, and also found that ITC could not produce any binding curves when Anc2 was tested with d-fucose, as expected, and so was not illustrated in the Fig 2 data. Inclusion of these non-responsive ITC experiments would likely make this clearer, and we will include this in any future versions. Anc1 and Anc2 have a sequence similarity of approximately 75%. Between these two ancestors, we see the functional transition of binding d-fucose to binding BMDG, partially based on the mutation of two significant binding site residues, F73L and W189S. These residues make the Anc1 binding pocket much more hydrophobic, and sterically bulky, compared to Anc2, and likely accounts for the change in specificity from Anc1-2, although we also expect that epistatic networks of mutations also affect binding specificity beyond just these two identified mutations. Differences between Ancs 2-4 in terms of thermodynamic contributions of entropy and enthalpy have less obvious binding pocket mutations than Anc1-Anc2, so are likely imparted by more overall changes in dynamics from distal mutations. Point 5. “It should be noted that he apo and ᴅ-fucose-bound ΔAnc1 structures were obtain from crystals from same crystal screening drop i.e., the observed differences are not due to differences in crystallization conditions”. Was this a co-crystallization experiment where two crystals were looped from a single drop - one crystal led to a structure with fucose bound and the other was apo? Crystals with different symmetry (and different crystal packing) can grow in the same drop from identical conditions. The listed space groups in Supplementary Table 2 indicated that the space group was different for the apo and fucose-bound Anc1. Is there concern that the conformational change observed between holo and apo-protein is influenced by the differences in crystal packing? The cell dimensions are similar, can the authors check that the data indexing is consistent? Point 5. We apologise for any ambiguity in the methods. The apo and d-fucose bound structures originated from the same crystal drop, where the crystals were grown without d-fucose. A crystal was fished out, as the apo sample, before the drop was soaked with d-fucose, and another crystal removed as the d-fucose bound structure. We agree that polymorphism could occur in this instance, where crystals grown in the same drop have different space groups. However, we hoped that conducting our experiment this way, using the same drop, would minimise differences in packing between ligand-bound and apo structures that might arise through separate co-crystallisation experiments. We agree that the cell dimensions are similar, and we put this down to the ligand binding event inducing repacking that changed the symmetry, likely through twinning. We used Xtriage to test the presence of any twinning in our Anc1 crystal structures. Running Xtriage on the merged and scaled apo reflections gave no indication of twinning in P212121 space group (twinning in P212121 is not possible), while the holo reflections strongly suggested twinning (type PM, twin law -h,-k,-l) with space group P21. Confirmation with Zanuda in the CCP4 suite showed that apo P212121 was the best space group for Anc1 apo. Zanuda could not distinguish P2 or P1 as better space groups for Anc 1 holo in terms of Rfree, but could categorically rule out P212121 as the holo space group. We found that refinement with P21, using the twin model identified in Xtriage, gave best density for the ligand, and better Rfree/Rwork values, and thus we concluded that Anc1 holo is most likely P21 (twinned). We will include the discussion of this twinning in any updates of the crystallographic statistics table/methods. What assisted us in our conclusions that crystal packing didn’t radically affect our interpretation of structural flexibility was the agreement between apo and holo, as well as an Anc1-glycerol bound structure that was solved from a different crystallisation experiment and in a different space group, were in good agreement with the areas of disorder/flexibility in Anc1. This supported the conclusion that the disorder we see in Anc1 is a reflection of the properties of the protein, as we see them in different space groups and experiments. We are in the process of performing molecular dynamics simulations to further test this. Point 6. The authors point out that LacI is a functional homodimer in Figure 1 but do not distinguish whether they are investigating the homodimer or monomeric form in subsequent experiments. It would be helpful to clarify which oligomeric state they are investigating in their experiments (DSF, ITC, etc.). See minor point 3. Point 6. In the crystal structures and at the concentrations where the protein was functionally tested, it is predominantly in the homodimeric form; it is also functional in vivo - again consistent with it adopting the functional homodimer. Point 7. D-fucose is smaller and more hydrophobic than BMDG/lactose. It follows that a protein’s binding pocket that is smaller and more hydrophobic (e.g. better packed) will favor D-fucose binding. Given that core packing is a well-established mechanism of protein stabilization (e.g. PMID 27425410), how do the authors think about whether this reflects well established principles in molecular recognition and protein stability vs novel mechanistic insight specific to sugar recognition evolution? Point 7. We agree that hydrophobic packing can favour smaller ligands and contribute to protein stability. However, our results indicate a distinct and evolvable thermodynamic mode switch in sugar recognition along the LGF trajectory that cannot be explained by a shrinking pocket size alone. In fact we find that, generally, Anc1-d fucose adopts a more open, less well-packed binding mode when compared to the Anc4-BMDG complex that undergoes a distinct open-closed transition upon binding. We hope to not overemphasise the stability of Anc1 as the main point of this paper; if Anc1 is more stable due to its more hydrophobic binding pocket, this doesn’t mean these effects aren’t related to how Anc1 has evolved to recognise a particular sugar like d-fucose, or the thermodynamic drivers of this binding. This idea of a hydrophobic binding pocket leading to high thermostability is not a trend observed in all other small sugar binding proteins. Minor points Point 1. Check the Figure 4 legend matches the subpanel letters. E.g. panel “a” shows BMDG not D-fucose. Point 1. Thank you for pointing this out! We apologise for the confusion, and will fix this in future versions. Point 2. IPTG is a synthetic analogue of allolactose and is unlikely to be encountered by evolution in the context of this work. Was this included because it was in the initial carbon source panel? Point 2. We agree that IPTG is not a naturally occurring molecule, and did not include it in tests of our Anc TFs including the high-throughput screening. Additionally, we used lactose as the positive control of our in vivo assays. We include the structure of IPTG in figure 2 for clarity on its similarity to the assayed sugars (fucose, BMDG, etc), as a comparative structure for those readers likely more similar with LacI binding to IPTG. Point 3. Supplementary Figure 6. Only Anc3 and Anc4 appear to have a well defined transition in the CD melt curves. Are the fits to a sigmoidal curve meaningful for the other curves? How were the uncertainties calculated for these fits? Perhaps quote confidence intervals instead of SEM? Point 3. We agree the transitions for Anc3 and Anc4 are the most sharply defined, whereas Anc1 & Anc2 show less pronounced baselines and broader transitions. In line with that, the Anc2 CD Tm has a visibly larger uncertainty (+- 6 °C) than the others, reflecting weaker constraint by the data, while Anc1’s CD fit gives ~91.0 °C, and the DSF scan did not detect a transition within range (so we reported as >100 °C). Together these indicate an increase in thermostability toward deeper ancestors, with Anc1 recorded as a lower bound by CD and a high Tm by DSF, but we agree the precision differs among constructs. The DSF dye is known to interact with exposed hydrophobic patches in native states for some proteins, accordingly, we treat the DSF value as an upper bound rather than an exact Tm and use comparison to the CD derived data for confirmation. We agree that CIs could be more informative than SEM for these less certain melt fits, and would better reflect any uncertainty in the data. Point 4. “ᴅ-fucose retains degrees of freedom in the Anc1 binding pocket, contrary to the idea that ligands lose their conformational entropy on binding.” How was “degrees of freedom” assessed in this case? Were multiple conformations observed in the electron density maps? Point 4. We observed d-fucose to have moderately higher b-factors when in the Anc1 binding pocket, compared to BMDG in the Anc4 binding pocket. We observed that, of the 8 Anc1-fucose proteins in the asymmetrical unit, fucose bound not with a strictly different conformation i.e. all motifs of the 8 sugar rings pointed in overlaying directions. However, the sugar ring itself displays some puckering between copies, and while the protein units overlay with most binding pocket residues in >0.5 Å agreement, the O5 in the d-fucose differs between copies in up to 1.7 Å shifts. Point 5. Ensemble refinement (PMID 23251785) was used to assess protein disorder, however, it is not mentioned in the results text. The Rfree values for the input models to Supplementary Table 5 to help comparison. The Rfree values were up to 5% worse for the ensembles compared to refinement of a single structure (e.g. 21.21 vs 26.21 for the Anc1 glycerol structure). This suggests that the ensemble is worse than a single model. The authors should justify the inclusion of these results. Point 5. Thank you for noticing this - our initial pTLS setting came from the optimise pTLS option and was sub-optimal for Anc1:glycerol; we will instead include our fine grid ensemble refinement results with an explicit pTLS grid (0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0). We note that ensemble refinement was not used for actual refinement of the crystal structures, but as a method for visualising the flexibility in the ancestral structures. We did no specific analysis of the ensemble refinement, so it was not elaborated on in the results section. We are in the process of re-doing this refinement accordingly. Point 6. The lac operon regulates genes associated with the metabolism of lactose. What did the fuc operon regulate? (Perhaps the genes are hinted at in gray text in Figure 1b?) Point 6. The fuc operon encodes transporters and enzymes for the uptake and catabolism of L-fucose, found in plant cell walls and host glycans. Although our experiments focused on D-fucose, as identified as the strongest binder in the HTS, L-fucose was also screened for and identified as a potential binder in Anc1, although not to an extent that satisfied our requirements for a strong binder, of >2 ºC stabilisation in the DSF HTS. In our study, we do see D-fucose as being able to allosterically signal LacOsym regulation and functioning as a regulator, as lactose does in LacI. The question of what a D-fucose binding LacI/GalR TF was doing several billion years ago is interesting; we don’t want to speculate too much. However, D/L ratios from abiotic chemistry were likely to be less skewed to L-fucose than in extant systems, and it is possible the “true” ligand is a close analog of D-fucose that had an important role at the time. Point 7. “These findings are suggestive of an evolutionary transition from binding of lactose/BMDG to ᴅ-fucose.” The reverse, right? D-fucose in ancestor, Lactose in extant? Point 7. Yes, we agree this is confusing, and we will update this sentence in future versions. Point 8. Figure 2d could be improved by adding the results from all sugars tested with each ancestor. Point 8. Thank you for your suggestion. This info is in the supporting information presently, and it will be moved up to the main text in future versions. Finally, thank you for the help in improving the paper - our first (hopefully not last) experience of open peer review!",2025-09-17T05:56:51,rosiegeorgelin,Rosie Georgelin,,,,

The application of membrane inserts which provides a natural like environment for ovaries and whole mount antibody staining that helps to detect proteins in intact tissues/organs are interesting. The Chromatin and Reproductive Aging Research Lab (CARL) of Hebrew university, led by Professor Michael Klustein, has discussed the manuscript on its regular lab meeting session and compiled the following comments. Major Comments In the introduction part, the paper doesn’t explain the objective/s of the protocol and its advantages over the pre-established protocols and the improvements it has. For intact and big tissues, like ovaries, light sheet microscopy is a good choice to evaluate the 3D structures of the ovary and its content. Therefore, the paper would be more complete if it evaluates the ovaries with light sheet microscopy. The discussion is not referred to and compared with previous studies in which it is difficult to validate and understand the protocol novelty and variability. Minor comments On the protocol section, Subsection 2, it says “All reagents used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1.”  However, the table is not found anywhere.  It is also better to use different numbering systems for different headings (e.g.  Roman numbering system for the subheadings, Arabic for the details.). In addition, it would be clearer if the experiment design (control and treatment groups) is clearly presented in the protocol section, ethics and mice subsection. Figure 2, (C-C’-C’’) needs more clarification about what it represents. On graphs, significance bars are missed on the graphs E and G. There are some grammatical and typo errors. Especially, the Ovary culture and the Result part should be written in a very simple and concise way for better understanding. Overall, this work will be very useful for researchers studying reproductive biology involving ovary.",2025-09-16T14:34:39,hailemariamamsalu,Hailemariam Amsalu,,,,

It represents a valuable contribution to the field of therapeutic splicing correction. We would, however, like to kindly suggest that the manuscript could benefit from the inclusion of additional references to previous work in the field. Specifically, in vivo studies involving intravitreal injection of AAVs to deliver U1 snRNA to the mouse retina have already been conducted and evaluated for efficacy, safety, and potential off-target effects. We believe it would strengthen your manuscript to reference and discuss this study alongside citations of your own previous work (e.g., Balestra et al): •	Swirski S, May O, Ahlers M, Wissinger B, Greschner M, Jüschke C, Neidhardt J. In Vivo Efficacy and Safety Evaluations of Therapeutic Splicing Correction Using U1 snRNA in the Mouse Retina. Cells. 2023 Mar 21;12(6):955. In addition, the following statements from your manuscript: “By targeting the 5′ splice site downstream of specific exons, ExSpeU1s can correct aberrant splicing in various cellular and mouse models” and “To restore defective splicing, ExSpeU1s have been created with sequence changes that permit targeted binding to intronic sequences downstream of the mutant 5’ ss” could benefit from referencing a related U1 snRNA splice-correction study in optic atrophy—a condition that, like familial dysautonomia, is characterized by retinal ganglion cell degeneration: •	Jüschke C, Klopstock T, Catarino CB, Owczarek-Lipska M, Wissinger B, Neidhardt J.

Finally, we would like to highlight two recent publications that might have implications toward potential risks of U1 therapy. Kim et al. showed that U1 snRNP may affect promoter activity by inhibiting premature polyadenylation, and Nadeu et al. identified recurrent tumour-specific U1 snRNA mutations in mature B-cell neoplasms: •	Kim G, Carroll CL, Wakefield ZP, Tuncay M, Fiszbein A.

No experimental protocol in biomedicine is able to fulfill 100% of the gaps that appear in the laboratory bench practice: there will always be room for individual decisions or unavoidable local differences. Point b) is that the argument of unavoidable protocol adaptations that explains the higher than expected heterogeneity among replicating labs also holds true between original and replicating labs, limiting any attempt (as well as interpretation) of rigorous replication. Moreover, the definition of what is and what is not replication is also an unsettled issue (eg., why 95% CI and not 90% CI since most protocols have breaks?). Replications occur involuntary in the everyday practice of lab, as yet discussed by several authors (e.g., Guttinger S, Leonelli S, Shiffrin, Börner & Stigler), since scientists always start their own research from some previous point in the literature. If this previous starting point doesn’t work, scientists move on to another experimental design, another starting point also taken from the literature. If this failure is also encountered by other labs, this flawed starting point is “naturally” left behind without being ever formally replicated.",2025-09-08T19:40:17,gilbenard,Gil Benard,,,,

Here the elimination of FKBP2, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone with a (putative) role in proinsulin folding, over time nudges the population of cells from what would otherwise be an efficient insulin secreting state (associated with metabolic health) to a state that disfavours proinsulin production and instead favours glucagon secretion and impaired glycemic control at the organismal level. This pathophysiological principal is observed in other ER stress states and as the authors suggest may be broadly implicated in its pathophysiology. The authors may wish to expand the discussion of the broader implications of their work. With this in mind, that may wish to take stock of work form the Cheah lab, dating from 2007 that flagged for attention the interrelatedness of chronic stress, de-differentiation and cell survival (in their case, as it applies to collagen-secreting chondrocytes, Tsang, K.

Best, Marouen Ben Guebila This preprint by Liu et al. provides a timely and needed analysis of the effects of transcription factor (TF) dose response on chromatin accessibility and gene expression using a novel automated ATAC-seq platform. Methods for estimating TF dosage effects are limited and RoboATAC, in combination with ChromBPNet can be a powerful combination to do large-scale experiments and applications in various disease conditions. I have reviewed the main text and figures but not the supplementary material Main comments: The use of HEK293T as a cell model seems adequate to calibrate the method and derive cell-specific regulatory programs and their relation to TF dosage. Shortcomings related to lack of Histone-Chip data and the lack of expression of certain co-activators were adequately addressed by authors. L162: “Given that the majority of the selected TFs primarily function as transcriptional activators,” → This analysis would benefit from a discussion on why most TFs have activator/repressor activity for each gene (Figure 1H). “To investigate the predictive power of DNA sequence alone, we trained ChromBPNet models for each condition after merging replicates.” → How were replicates merged (intersection, union, average)? In Figure 2e - Multinomial regression . Why did this analysis exclude the 4th group of regions “sensitive non-saturating” ? “The inclusion of chromatin state features did not enhance performance for saturating sensitive peaks and closed nonsensitive peaks, and only marginally improved performance for open nonsensitive peaks. This slight enhancement of predictive power may suggest more complex regulatory mechanisms are at play in open nonsensitive peaks” → In this logistic regression analysis, features were considered independently. However, it might be beneficial to model interactions between sequence and chromatin states, to improve prediction and also have more accurate estimates of feature importance. This can be done manually because the number of interactions is small, or automatically by using Random Forests, which model interactions efficiently. With regards to the multinomial regression analysis, it is not clear whether each class was modeled independently or whether multivariate regression was conducted. In the latter case, it might be worth modeling the covariance in the error term to improve prediction. Minor comments: L268 specific ChromBPNet model. (Fig. 3G). → Typo: There is an extra period after “model”. “Our data suggests that the conditions necessary for cooperative IRF4 binding to 3 bp-spaced ISRE” → This statement is not clear from figure 4-E, 2 bp and 3 bp spacing seem similar at high dose ranges for IRF4 head to tail configuration. “As previously shown (Fig. 3), SOX2 begins interacting” –> This result is shown in Figure-3D and E. In Figure 6, would it be possible to create a figure 6B-like (motif by dose) for SPI1 and ELF1?",2025-09-02T17:16:59,marouenbenguebila,Marouen Ben Guebila,,,,
