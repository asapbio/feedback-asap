The abstract provides a clear background on the antibody-dependent enhancement issue in DENV pathogenesis and its impact on vaccine development. The objectives of the study are also well-defined. However, I recommend adding a brief explanation of saturation mutagenesis and directed evolution for readers who may not be familiar with these techniques. It is interesting to note the development of the D2-FL and D2-FLM variants that evade both pre-membrane and fusion-loop antibodies. I suggest providing more information on the functional analysis and characterization of these engineered variants, including any potential impact on viral fitness, replication, or virulence. The observation of lower neutralization titers against D2-FL and D2-FLM in heterotypic serum compared to isogenic wildtype DENV2 is an important finding. However, it would be helpful to include some quantitative data or statistical analysis to support this observation. In the conclusion, you propose the use of D2-FL and D2-FLM as tools for delineating cross-reactive antibody subtypes and as a platform for safer live attenuated DENV vaccines. While this is a promising application, it would be valuable to discuss any preliminary data or experiments that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these engineered viruses in vivo. In summary, the abstract presents an innovative approach to address a significant challenge in DENV vaccine development. With some additional details and clarification, it will provide a strong foundation for a compelling research article. I look forward to seeing the full paper and the outcomes of this exciting work.",2023-04-25T15:45:25,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2023.03.22.533803,Evolution of a Functionally Intact but Antigenically Distinct DENV Fusion Loop,"Rita M.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.13.532351v1#comment-6169645977,biorxivstage,1,"We read this manuscript with great interest, and were uniformly intrigued by the network approach to thinking about polyploidy evolution and the possibilities it offers. In particular, it was nice to see how these approaches provide results that largely match with the gene balance model and other ideas about how polyploids might evolve, and we liked that comparison to results in mammals suggests the uniformity of these processes across the tree of life. Nonetheless, our discussion led to several suggestions that we hope might help improve the manuscript. We stress, however, that we recognize the authors have thought about these ideas much longer than we have, and that some of our comments may stem from our own misunderstanding of the work. In the manuscript the authors recognize that comparison to null networks is important for distinguishing intriguing features of real networks. The authors generate a good null expectation for motifs in a GRN by modeling random degree-preserving unscaled networks and counting motifs. We wondered, however, whether random unduplicated networks are the appropriate null. Simple duplication of all the nodes in a network, where each node maintains its links, will create a network with bilateral symmetry. This symmetry will give rise to symmetrical motifs – for example two nodes connected by a directed link will generate a bifan motif when duplicated. Over time, or after random perturbations to the links and nodes in the network, this bifan could be degraded to form triangular motifs like the V and lambda motifs. Because duplication creates new motifs, the expected number of motifs should be much higher in a duplicated GRN created by whole genome duplication. A symmetrical null model should capture this higher motif frequency. Testing hypotheses with a revised null model could yield exciting results and address additional questions: . Is the observation of motif enrichment an inevitable consequence of network duplication? Is the search for motifs with bilateral symmetry why patterns in Solanum – the result of a triplication – are an exception to the observed patterns? A fair bit of the discussion focuses on the timing of polyploidy. Here we felt it would help readers to introduce them earlier to the ages of the different polyploidy events studied. We also felt the authors could do more to distinguish between the age and number of polyploidy events – in their examples, species with “newer” polyploidy events were also those with the largest number of total events, for example. And even the newest events are many millions of years old – is a 5myo polyploidy event expected to be much different from a 15 or 30myo event? Throughout, we felt there were places where explicit hypotheses would help the reader. What are the predictions made by different models of duplication and evolution? Do we expect these to differ qualitatively or quantitatively between GRNs and PPI? Do we have predictions about which GO terms might be significant and why? (e.g. why should stress genes hang around longer?). Laying these out would especially be helpful for biologists less familiar with networks and the gene balance hypothesis and their comparisons. The authors compare duplicates from WGD to those from SSD, but neither group is homogeneous. Whole genome duplications may be the result of allopolyploidy or autopolyploidy, which could impact the detection of different motifs. It would be useful for the authors to discuss the implications of the type of ancestral WGD event and how it could bias their detection of motifs and subsequent findings. Additionally, the software developed by the authors’ research group, `doubletrouble`, appears to separate SSDs into 4 categories (tandem, proximal, transposed, and dispersed duplications). Would we expect patterns for the various types of SSDs to differ? Is the variation depicted in Figure 2 for the SSD-derived gene pairs a result of variation between SSD classes or other types of noise? Finally, we wondered how large-scale duplications of multiple genes or even aneuploidy might lead to different results, especially if there is any clustering of genes by function.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.06.535924v1#comment-6167282460,biorxivstage,3,"The manuscript entitled: “Layer Dependence of Monocular and Binocular Responses in Human Ocular Dominance Columns at 7T using VASO and BOLD” is an exciting manuscript describing a high-resolution VASO study to measure laminar and columnar signal variations in V1. This study uses an extraordinary experimental setup with some most advanced imaging hardware and some of the most advanced sequences, and custom built stimulation equipment. It touches on some of the most important issues of the field of high-resolution imaging, including. Finding a good compromise of sensitivity and specificity, Multimodal sequences (VASO and BOLD) and how to combine signals across them. Using NORDIC noise cleaning, which is a hot topic in the field and many researchers are looking at how this develops. Simultaneous columnar and laminar imaging. In my understanding this is a methods-focused study that investigates these topics in the ‘testbed’ of ocular dominance columns. I believe this is an appropriate model, as it has been previously established for such purposes:  E.g. Kemper et al. (2018, see Fig. 2 for simultaneous columnar and laminar features) and Feinberg et al. (2018, see Fig. 7-8 for ODC across depth). And also see (Hollander et al., 2021) (Zaretskaya 2020) (Qian 2023) (Haenelt 2020). Simultaneous columnar and laminar analyses aside of ODC are more sparse:  E.g. De Martino et al. (2015) in the auditory cortex, Huber et al (2020) in the sensorimotor system, and  Schneider et al. (2019) in V5/MT+. I see many strengths of the paper: -> The study uses advanced experimental setups. -> There is a nice inherent reproducibility happening in this study. Each result is reproduced for left and right eyes/columns, respectively. -> The authors succeed in transparently describing the data in a relatively raw form. E.g. showing voxel-wise activation maps, showing single contrast responses (not only differential responses). This helps the reader to appreciate the raw data quality. Unfortunately, in recent years it has become too common to solely show high level end results as abstract line plots. This paper does not have such shortcomings. However, this might mean that some readers might wonder why voxels were not selected as contrast responses ( e.g. left vs. right). I think there is one minor point of potential confusion. I have talked to two colleagues about what they think about the preprint and both brought this up. If the authors agree, they could clarify the potential danger of double-dipping (or lack thereof): The authors select voxels based on the response to a given eye. Then they use these voxels to test if the response to the same eye is stronger than to another eye. This might be perceived as circular. Thus even in random noise, those voxels will have a non-zero mean bias, based on their selection criteria. I think there are many steps and controls that the authors do that mitigate the danger of double dipping: -> The voxels are selected on a single contrast, while the subsequent conclusion about the contrast difference. But even doing so, there might still be a stronger bias in one condition than the other condition. -> BOLD results speak against the danger of double dipping. The voxels that are selected for left eye responses end up showing even stronger responses for the right eye (Fig. 4B). If there would be a danger of double-dipping the result would be the other way around. Or maybe with a different voxel selection, the right-eye dominance in this plot would be even stronger. -> The authors also analyze the BOLD data in the voxels that have been selected from the VASO signal. And they reproduce the result that the eye-selectivity is stronger in VASO than BOLD. Though, there might be a residual noise coupling between VASO and BOLD via the BOLD correction procedure. The authors could consider discussing the danger of double dipping. If their data size allows, they should perform the voxel selection and the contrast testing on independent parts of the dataset. Typos and stylistic comments: -> The TR is given as the inversion-recovery TR of 3294ms. Technically this is referring to the time of acquiring two volumes plus inversion delay. This number refers to the effective temporal resolution but does not refer to the COBIDAS definition of a TR, which would be the acquisition of each volume (e.g. like the TR definition in ASL sequences). Maybe it would be clearer to call it TR_pair or something like this? -> It would be great to mention the matrix size (or FOV). This way the reader can appreciate the advanced protocol of 0.7mm resolution. -> It would be great to mention the phase encoding direction. I suspect that the head gradient allows read directions in A>>P direction, which is usually prohibited by PNS for body gradients. -> It would be informative to mention the NORDIC version (e.g. github release number). There have been some differences and improvements for later versions. -> The application of layer-specific smoothing can be reasonable. Especially, if the SNR of non-BOLD contrasts at 0.7mm is otherwise too low to see anything. But it might still appear strange to some naive readers without any justification. Maybe the authors can include a sentence or two giving slightly more background. E.g. stating that this moothing should not affect the direction differential modulations (only reduce the effect size a bit, maybe). Or stating that this is necessary due to the unconventionally small voxel sizes? -> It’s a matter of style who to cite and not to cite and it does not change the results nor the credibility of the conclusions. The authors could consider including more references of previous studies that did simultaneous laminar and columnar OCD fMRI in humans (e.g. listed above). -> “Martino” should be “De Martino” -> GREASE should be GRASE. -> The end of 2.4.1 states that a binary mask was used to confine the voxels. It might help the reproducibility to add a little more detail. Was this a GM ROI? Was this an anatomically defined V1 mask? -> The manuscript states that the columns are shown on Fig. 3. This figure shows surface maps. So, it is not clear how consistent the pattern is across cortical depths and the pattern really refers to columnar structures. Maybe the authors can include a brief statement that is shown in Fig. 3. Is this the signal averaged across cortical depth? Is it referring to the signal in the middle layer? -> In the field of layer-fMRI there are many common procedures on how the signal pooling is done which leads to different results ( https://twitter.com/layerfM.... I think each approach is justifiable. Here it is done on a voxel-specific level. This means that BOLD and VASO might have different numbers of voxels across depths. I do not think that this is a concern here because the authors look at both contrasts in either set of voxels. But it might help the reader if it’s explicitly mentioned whether the numbers of voxels per layer are substantially different. -> WM voxels in Fig. 2B. It might appear weird to inexperienced readers why VASO has so much ‘activity’ in white matter. Since the activation threshold is at 0, this is not concerning. Even for random noise, half of WM should be visible as ‘active’. Given that the GRADSMOOTH is isotropic in WM and linearly-oriented in GM the effective smoothing is different across tissue types. Maybe it would make sense to include a short explanation on how to interpret the WM voxels? -> Some readers might be spoiled by overly beautiful and clear tiny parallel stripes that hit the V1/V2 border in a perpendicular direction (e.g. Nasr 2016). This is not so clearly visible here. Maybe it’s worth considering to justify this. e.g.  highlight that the resolution here is substantially higher and that the sequence is non-BOLD. Unlike previous studies, this allows vein free interpretation of depth profiles. This is a different goal than obtaining the most beautiful vein-enhanced surface maps. -> The introduction states “veins blur both the laminar and columnar BOLD responses”. The word “blur” could be specified. E.g. “distort” or “misplace” would be good alternatives. I hope to see this manuscript published in a highly respected journal. _________________ The above letter is a summary of a zoom call between Federico De Martino and Renzo Huber.

We acknowledge that there can be advantages to pseudobulk methods, and that no single method is likely to outperform all others in all settings. As the technologies and methods used in our paper are now over four years old, in a rapidly moving field, we expect many newer analyses will be able to clearly outperform previous papers in the field, including ours. More broadly, we encourage students and practitioners to revisit previous papers as a general practice of open science, and to share the results in open, respectful, and transparent ways, which can move the field forward collaboratively and constructively. That said, in this particular case, Murphy et al.'s results fall short of their claims, and they fail to demonstrate any advantages of their approach compared to our manuscript, due to several technical and logical mistakes in their analysis, which we outline here: http://compbio.mit.edu/scAD... Briefly: * Murphy et al. do not compare to our actual 1,031 reported differentially expressed genes (DEGs), they exclude our mixed-model results from their comparison, thus misinterpreting our work as cell-level-only with 14,274 DEGs, which is a misrepresentation of our results. * They interpret any differences between their results and ours as improvements (conflating false positives with true predictions and lack of power with specificity) without providing any independent support – by contrast, our paper validated our DEGs using both targeted experiments and comparison with previous human and animal studies. * Their central claim that our reported DEGs are false positives lacks any substance: indeed, they are not found by their pseudobulk method, but they could simply be missed due to lack of power, and Murphy et al. provide no independent evidence that their method is sensitive or accurate. * Conversely, the 16 DEGs that they do report lack any independent evidence that they are biologically meaningful, and Murphy et al. provide no evidence that their method is specific. In fact, their 16 DEGs show unrealistically-high ~1200% median changes, and only implicate the rarest cell types, suggesting they may represent false positives stemming from unaddressed statistical artifacts due to outliers and small cell counts. * Murphy et al. also make general claims about the advantages of pseudobulk methods by applying only one method, erroneously, to only one dataset, without any benchmarks, and without comparison to current state-of-the-art methods, while misusing statistical terminology. * Lastly, they overstate their previous results from a similar Matters Arising commentary, which also advocated for pseudobulk using the same pattern of only analyzing a single dataset, methodological shortcomings, overstated conclusions, and not addressing corrections suggested by the original authors. This is a helpful example to discuss potential pitfalls in comparing bioinformatic pipelines, and to recommend perhaps more constructive strategies for such comparisons, including: applying candidate methods to more than one dataset, comparing to the actual results of the original paper without misrepresenting them, using independent validation metrics to evaluate differences instead of assuming that they are all improvements, using well-established and rigorous benchmarks, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methodologies, scrutinizing their own predictions for potential confounders, and seeking to understand the biological or technical drivers of potential differences.

The paper ameliorates apparent discrepancies between previously published in vivo and in vitro results, where N. gonorrhoeae expressing opaD are isolated from host neutrophil-rich secretions, but are killed when infecting neutrophils in vitro. The current study establishes a novel, complement-independent, protective role for C4BP against neutrophil activity. Thus, the work clarifies a major paradox in the field. The manuscript was a pleasure to read. It is logically laid out and clearly presented. The conclusions are well supported by the data. We have only minor suggestions to help improve some aspects of clarity: Minor Comments 1. On line 34, the authors state that there are 98 million cases annually of gonorrhea world-wide while on line 47 they state that there are 86.9 million cases. If the numbers refer to different things, the authors should describe the distinction. 2. Figure 1A and 1B both include data showing the proportion of surviving cells with 25% serum at 60 minutes, but those percentages are rather different: ~70% in Figure 1A and ~30% in Figure 1B. Is this variability due to differences in serum used or does it simply reflect variability in the measurement? 3. In Figure 2A, the authors test the ability of serum from different animal species to inhibit ROS production. Chimpanzees have been used to model gonorrhea infection, so it would be interesting to see how chimpanzee serum compares to human serum in this experiment. 4. Figure 5F is slightly confusing. Are the authors suggesting that if a bacterium is associated with a neutrophil, it will be taken up no matter what? A more detailed description of the experiment in the text would help clarify this. 5. Is C4BP known for being able to survive heat-inactivation without being denatured? If so, the authors should state this. 6. The rationale for using salt fractionation could be explained more clearly. 7. C4BP and OpaD play a major role when neutrophils are present. Can the authors speculate on how these proteins fit into the full pathogenic cycle? For example, where do they place among other processes that prevent killing by neutrophils?",2023-04-20T13:58:02,disqus_y9FR6hyg5J,Joseph Wade,10.1101/2022.12.08.519701,Neisseria gonorrhoeae co-opts C4b-binding protein to enhance complement-independent survival from neutrophils,"Lacie M.

As we have extensively documented and published, antigen retention during sequential staining process is as crucial as an efficient antibody stripping ( doi:10.1369/0022155417719419 ). Having shown that boiling in retrieval buffer, 6M Urea and a pH 2 glycine buffer do not remove all bound antibodies ( doi:10.1369/0022155414536732 ), we published that both bound antibody and tissue antigen conformation needs to be preserved over cycling: disaccharides provide such protection ( doi:10.1369/0022155415616162 ). Antibodies survive >30 cycles of staining and stripping with the MILAN protocol ( https://doi.org/10.21203/rs...) and only 3 out of 314 are selectively inactivated by the 2ME/SDS buffer. Thus the relatively high number of antibodies who fail to stain later in the cycles after antigen retrieval has no other explanation than antigen re-masking. The key problem NM Claudio and colleagues face is that the ethanol step required to remove the chromogen will probably denature and precipitate in-situ bound antibodies, making them available to detection in the next step, as they document. Disaccharides are insoluble in ethanol, therefore tertiary structure protection is at risk during this step. We suggest to use the MILAN protocol to strip bound antibodies before the chromogen inactivation step.",2023-04-16T08:12:08,giorgio_cattoretti,Giorgio Cattoretti,10.1101/2023.04.13.536793,Sequential chromogenic immunohistochemistry: spatial analysis of lymph nodes identifies contact interactions between plasmacytoid dendritic cells and plasmablasts,"N.M.

The current study investigates the mechanisms by which plasmids can be transiently maintained, in the presence of targeting by a CRISPR-Cas system. The paper supports the idea that the plasmid and intact CRISPR-Cas system are not compatible within a single bacterium, and identifies loss of CRISPR spacers and mutations in cas9 as mechanisms that facilitate plasmid retention. The experiments in this paper are straightforward and the conclusions drawn are well supported by the data. Some more description of the WT1 population would be helpful. Also, we found the format of Figure 2 to be confusing, and we suggest a simpler representation that focuses on the specific spacers that are lost rather than the order of spacers in the CRISPR array. Lastly, the discussion does not compare the mechanisms described here with those observed in previous studies looking at bacteria with self-targeting spacers. Major comments 1. It is unclear which genetic changes in the WT1 population lead to plasmid retention. The authors should discuss this in more detail. 2. The layout of Figure 2 is difficult to understand, for three reasons. First, the way the data are represented is not clearly explained in the Figure. If the authors choose to keep Figure 2 as a main figure, we recommend adding Figure S3 as a panel in Figure 2. Second, as the authors discuss, there are weaknesses associated with using p-values rather than simple abundance (i.e., Figure S4). The abundance numbers appear to tell the full story. Third, the authors do not explain why the order of spacers in the array is important, as opposed to the presence/absence of specific spacers. We suggest showing only the frequency of detection for individual spacers, rather than spacer pairs. 3. The authors do not compare the mechanisms discovered here to those described in previous studies that look at self-targeting spacers. We suggest including PMID 23637624 in that discussion as well as the authors’ own work. Minor comments 1.

In this study, they investigate the significance of type 2 immunity as a means of protecting the host against pathogenic helminths. On the other hand, pathologic type 2 immune responses are responsible for the development and maintenance of allergic diseases. In order to facilitate the creation of efficient methods for avoiding or treating these very widespread illnesses, it is vital to decipher the mechanisms that guide type 2 immunity. In mucosal tissues, type 2 responses are responsible for regulating allergic reactions and immunity to helminths. However, the processes that govern these cells are not well known, despite the fact that tuft cells are critical immune system regulators for type 2 immunity. This study investigates the mechanism by which intestinal tuft cells are diminished by commensal bacteria that produce butyrate. Butyrate's ability to inhibit tuft cells required the presence of the epigenetic enzyme known as histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). This finding suggests that HDAC3 may play a role in the promotion of tuft cell-dependent immunity. Epithelial-intrinsic HDAC3 actively controlled the growth of tuft cells in vivo and was required for the induction of type 2 immune responses after helminth infection. Curiously, butyrate blocked stem cell differentiation into tuft cells epigenetically, and inhibition of HDAC3 was sufficient to suppress tuft cell proliferation in adult mice and human intestinal organoids. Both of these findings are intriguing. These findings show a novel level of control that commensal bacteria use to calibrate intestinal immunity and disclose an epigenetic route in stem cells that governs tuft cell development. In addition, these findings shed information on how stem cells regulate tuft cell differentiation. It has been shown that the composition of microbiota is linked to the onset of a variety of chronic inflammatory illnesses, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, and allergic rhinitis. According to the data provided in the research, commensal bacterial-derived metabolites play an important role in epigenetically regulating type 2 intestinal immune responses through active regulation of tuft cell growth. The studies that are being addressed here have shed light on the significance of this function for metabolites that are generated from commensal bacteria. These cells are to blame for the increased sensitivity in the airways, and they can be discovered elsewhere in the body. It is noteworthy to note that HDAC3 is expressed everywhere, and that the levels of butyrate in extraintestinal areas mirror the bacterial colonization of those regions. Both of these facts are related to the fact that HDAC3 is expressed everywhere. As a consequence of this, it is not inconceivable that butyrate manipulation of HDAC3 may potentially alter immunological responses that are dependent on tuft cells in distant tissue areas. As a consequence of this, it is possible that treating pathologic inflammation throughout mucosal tissues using treatments that include modulating this system using pharmacological agents, methods based on nutrition, or ways based on microbiota might be useful. Using a variety of research approaches and points of view, such as mouse models, human biopsies, organoids, and the interactions of microbiota, this work investigates the linkages between tuft cells and expands our understanding of the influence that microbiota have, which is currently understudied, on type 2 immunology. Positive feedback. I truly appreciate how in-depth the research was, as well as how well-written the paper itself was. In addition to doing research on tuft cells in mouse models, the researchers investigated the formation of human tuft cells in connection to butyrate. They also investigated the microbiome for polymicrobial interactions and biochemistry. The outcomes of the investigation were supported by a wealth of information and high-quality microscopy in the aforementioned study. Employing this helminth was a brilliant choice, in my opinion, given that Nippostrongylus brasiliensis normally colonized rodents as a host organism. I had never heard of using organoids in tuft cell studies before, so I thought it was a really novel approach. It was quite intriguing to see how the findings from mice applied to human organoid samples. Things to Possibly Consider The use of butyrate for therapy is not clearly explained. Is it concentration-dependent? The immune response is not well understood. ILC2 (frequency) is the only measurement available, although it is not a reliable indicator of immunological response. What about the IgE reaction after worm infection? the Th2 cytokines? actual (as opposed to merely their frequency) It would be interesting to look at the immune response's effectiveness under various settings in the mouse model. It's wonderful to see how HDAC3 affects the animals with a deficiency. I do, however, wonder whether there is an additional method, such as using drugs. Perhaps this additional experiment could offer more  that additional evidence that HDAC3 is crucial to the mentioned events. There are inadequate controls in F. prausnitzii recolonization trials. For instance, a control using bacteria that do not produce butyrate as well as bacteria that have been destroyed would be valuable. A better data display is required. Please consider displaying data from individual mice on barcharts. Bar charts are no longer advised for use in scientific articles. Analysis of imaging data and how many tuft cells are detected per 1) unit area, or per 2) nucleated cell, must be done in addition to flow cytometry data. The number of cells in the entire tissue might then be extrapolated using this information. There are no examples of gating strategies for identifying cells (like ILC2s) in the whole study. Without them, it is impossible to determine if the percentages depicted in the numbers are accurate. Additionally, displayed flow cytometry plots (like Fig. 1B) should reflect the percentage of cells in each individual gate. There is insufficient evidence to prove that the Cre mice are true knockouts rather than knockdowns with a phenotypic. What takes place after eggs have been expelled for a period of more than ten days (Fig. 3E)? Is there a relationship between having poor control and having a low IgE response? Low numbers of eosinophils being recruited? It is likely that butyrate has more than one use. What evidence do we have that the key factor impacting HDAC3 expression actually does exist? What additional possibilities are there to consider? What consequences does the absence of HDAC3 in the gut have for macrophages, DCs, and neutrophils that have been recruited in response to an infection? This has to be broken down much more. During the course of a normal illness, does the amount of butyrate in the body change? It would be helpful to illustrate the variation in the datasets using barcharts that contain data points for each individual mouse. There is a possibility that organizing with many figures will be beneficial. For example, Figure 1 depicts three independent tests that are now being conducted. There is some ambiguity about the keys in Figure 2. It's possible that matching color to solid/empty will result in a more accurate translation of the information. Never brought up the L stage, which is important for when the worms were put subcutaneously if you can help it. Could include a life cycle to highlight the movement of the worm as well as the stage at when mice were initially exposed to it. If mice don't cough, how are the worms supposed to get out of the lungs and into the stomach? What was the purpose of the K9 exercise in figure 6? Please explain the reasoning behind your decision. Describe the steps that you take. Why was the promoter looked into only? 16S sequencing is not shown by the numbers, despite the fact that it is specified. Why stop at sequencing the 16S region when we could do the full genome? You should be able to demonstrate that levels of butyrate fluctuate or shift during an infection with helminths.

All from one site or geographically spread out?  Seems to me that without broad sampling across each basin and larger sample sizes that it is difficult to exclude the possibilities that rare alleles present in translocated fish have not been picked up in their source populations (thus they appear to be endemic to other rivers).  For instance, if translocated fish into a new river were sourced from Tinana Creek, and you ran this analysis without having sampled Tinana Creek you would conclude the population in that new river had lots of endemic alleles and represents an original population, not a translocated one simply because you hadn't sampled the source or close to the source population.  It would seem very simple for ""endemic"" alleles to be from the Mary River and simply either been lost today due to species decline, or just not sampled in the current study.  What are the frequency of these ""endemic"" alleles in the Brisbane and Pine rivers?  While the Pine River results are potentially harder to explain, to call the Brisbane results as being evidence for an original population seems rather weak.  Why would lungfish be so rare in the Brisbane originally compared to today when there are 10s of thousands of them present after only a few generations?  Also, your suggestion of not mixing these populations because you assume they are locally adapted is not what many conservation biologists advocate today, where mixing across populations is usually recommended and has shown success, at least in Macquarie Perch.  There is no direct evidence for local adaptation and all of the rivers are from a similar climatic region.  Fish from the Mary River have done fantastically well in the Brisbane River, so clearly any local adaptation to their old habitat has not stopped them from doing really well in their new different habitat.",2023-04-11T08:41:06,peterunmack,Peter Unmack,10.1101/2023.03.24.533984,Unravelling the mystery of endemic versus translocated populations of the endangered Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri),"Roberto Biello, Silvia Ghirotto, Daniel J.

However, I'd like to see you address a couple of technical issues and perhaps one theoretical issue in the final manuscript: - the output you posted shows some unusual results, which are potentially false positives that appear to be concentrated among the shotgun and noUDG samples. I'm guessing that this is due to the same types of ancient DNA damage creating IBD-like patterns in these samples. If so, isn't there a risk that many or even most of the individuals in your analysis are affected by this problem to some degree, which might be skewing your estimates of genealogical relatedness between them? - many individuals from groups that have experienced founder effects, such as Ashkenazi Jews, appear to be close genetic cousins, even though they're not genealogical cousins. Basically, the reason for this is a reduction in haplotype diversity in such populations. Have you considered the possibility that at least some of the close relationships that you're seeing between individuals and populations might be exaggerated by founder effects? - thanks to ancient DNA we've learned that the Yamnaya phenomenon isn't just an archeological horizon but also a closely related and genetically very similar group of people. Indeed, in my mind, ancient DNA has helped to redefine the Yamnaya concept, with Y-chromosome haplogroup R1b-Z2103 now being one of the key traits of the Yamnaya identity. So considering that the Corded Ware people are not rich in R1b-Z2103, and even the earliest Corded Ware individuals are somewhat different from the Yamnaya people in terms of genome-wide genetic structure, it doesn't seem right to keep claiming that the Corded Ware population is derived from Yamnaya. Indeed, I can't see anything in your IBD data that would preclude the idea that the Corded Ware and Yamnaya peoples were different populations derived from the same as yet unsampled pre-Yamnaya/post-Sredny steppe group.",2023-04-08T12:17:32,disqus_Og9I1KoklL,Davidski,10.1101/2023.03.08.531671,ancIBD - Screening for identity by descent segments in human ancient DNA,"Harald Ringbauer, Yilei Huang, Ali Akbari, Swapan Mallick, Nick Patterson, David Reich",2023-03-09

First, LMetalSite is a binding site detection method, which is not designed for binding protein identification. Most methods in this field are only trained on binding proteins. If the authors want to use LMetalSite to distinguish binding vs. non-binding proteins, they should re-design the output scores, just like [PepNN Commun Biol 2022]. However, they did not mention any details about how to convert the residue-level predictions by LMetalSite into protein-level predictions. Second, the datasets of LMetalSite removed redundant sequences sharing identity >25% over 30% alignment coverage, which is a strict and common threshold used in this community. The new datasets in M-Ionic collected sequences with no more than 20% identity, which is similar to LMetalSite. However, M-Ionic used a loose threshold for the alignment coverage (90%). Besides, the negative set collected by the authors only removed redundant sequences sharing 100% identity, which might be another potential problem.",2023-04-08T05:50:30,disqus_nGLtVfQB7S,Qianmu Yuan,10.1101/2023.04.06.535847,M-Ionic: Prediction of metal ion binding sites from sequence using residue embeddings,"Aditi Shenoy, Yogesh Kalakoti, Durai Sundar, Arne Elofsson",2023-04-06

Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) is a widely used animal model for understanding the pathogenesis of its’ human counterpart, Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). To initiate a productive infection the virus must first gain access to a host cell. MCMV has various glycoproteins on its surface that interact with specific host cellular receptors depending on cell type. It was recently shown that Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) is important for MCMV entry into a variety of cell types. Depending on the cell type MCMV utilizes different viral glycoproteins to attach and enter host cells. In fibroblasts, viral entry favors the utilization of viral glycoproteins gB in conjunction with gH/gL/gO known as the trimer. In endothelial, epithelial or myeloid cells, viral entry occurs through the use of gB, the trimer and another complex made up of gH/gL/gO/Mck2 which is known as the pentamer. Mck2 or mouse chemokine 2, has dual functionality in both viral entry and chemokine function. Currently it has not been elucidated the host cellular receptor that Mck2 utilizes for entry into host cells. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 screen, this study identifies the MHC-I molecule is implicated in MCK2 dependent entry into macrophages. Positive feedback. I felt that the way the paper is organized was logical and easy to follow. The color coding of the different viruses helped to follow along in the graphs. In the in vivo experiments, utilizing both plaque assays and fluorescence levels to confirm results made them more convincing. The restoration of the phenotype by complementation of B2m and CD81 made the results more convincing. Utilizing the two different viruses that either have or lack MCK2 definitely strengthens their argument.  In examining the B2m relationship with Mck2, performing the experiments both in primary cells and immortalized cells strengthens the argument. Using different virus strains that have different genetic manipulations of MCK2, is beneficial for showing that the phenotype is due to a defective protein and not just that specific mutation of the protein in that virus strain. Major Concerns Given that most of the initial experiments are done in cell culture, I would have expected there to be more replicates. Also why there are different numbers of replicates used between the different virus groups? Characterizing stromal cells as anything not Cd11c positive is a reach. The lack of substantial infectivity of these viruses, regardless of the presence of MCK2, in most of these cell lines makes the data hard to believe I wonder if the current in vivo data can truly tell if lack of H-2 molecules impacts dissemination. Alternatively, it could impact the rate of virus growth in the SG or in other tissues. To truly understand whether dissemination is impacted one must use barcoded viruses. Minor concerns While infectivity using these reporter viruses has been assessed by flow cytometry previously, I think that performing a plaque assay would further validate results. List the actual p values instead of using the star annotation Minor spelling errors (pg. 25 the strain C57BL/6 is spelled incorrectly) For Figure 4 C-E, it would be helpful to make the scales on each of the graphs the same to be able to compare between all three graphs. For Figure 5D, it would be beneficial to show the isotype control in the same panel as the MHC-1 to confirm increase/decrease of expression For those not in the field, I felt that there was not enough emphasis on what type of cellular entry MCK2 functions in, which would help the reader get a more complete understanding of the results. For figure 7, it would be more convincing that the viruses lacking MCK2 are in stromal cells if there was a specific marker used for stromal cells For figure 3C, it is a little unclear what the middle column is demonstrating if it is either a locus or reference sequence. This could be easily clarified in the figure legend or materials/methods section. In page 5 of the results, when talking about the defective MCK2 and how it was repaired, it would be helpful to make it more clear to the reader for how it was defective and how it was repaired. Why was the viral load in SG measured at day 7? What if a later time point (e.g., day 14) viral load is the same for two types of the viruses? This needs to be checked. Which specific H-2 molecules (L,D,K) are important for infection? This could be an interesting point of discussion. b2M-deficient mice may have weird NK cell response that could play a role in control of MCMV. Can the authors confirm that NK cells were not involved in viral control in these mice? In experiments even with MOI=1 infection rate is very low, <20%. Why? Would waiting for longer time to detect infected cells allow detecting all cells as infected?",2023-04-05T15:39:35,,UTK Micro Immunology JC,10.1101/2022.10.05.510922,MHC class Ia molecules facilitate MCK2-dependent MCMV infection of macrophages and virus dissemination to the salivary gland,"Berislav Bošnjak, Elisa Henze, Yvonne Lueder, Kim Thi Hoang Do, Alaleh Rezalofti, Christiane Ritter, Anja Schimrock, Stefanie Willenzon, Hristo Georgiev, Lea Fritz, Melanie Galla, Karen Wagner, Martin Messerle, Reinhold Förster",2022-10-07

We know that central tolerance – removal of T cells specific to self antigens – is not 100% efficient and some self-reactive T cells do accumulate in the periphery. This leaky process is likely responsible for some autoimmune reaction observed in humans. However, how such self-reactive T cells are activated remains poorly defined. The authors developed an interesting system where they have T cells recognizing a specific antigen that was engineered to be expressed in lung epithelial cells (OVA + 2W + gp66). By using the antigen with several epitopes this allows to investigate how T cell response to one of these epitopes impacts endogenous immune response to other epitopes. Interestingly, authors found that transfer of T cells specific to gp66 epitope into mice does not result in inflammatory response to 2W epitope by endogenous, 2W-specific CD4 T cells. Instead, the authors observed expansion of 2W-specific Tregs. Response was different in the lymph vs. lung. Interestingly, after primary response, immunization with 2W peptide with an adjuvant did not result in expansion of conventional, 2W-specific T cells indicating induction of tolerance. Expansion of 2W-specific Tregs was also observed by intranasal inoculation of LPS into mice. Overall, this study provides an interesting view on how ongoing immune response may influence response of self-specific CD4 T cells. Positive feedback. There are a lot of interesting things about this paper. First, the system to have lung-restricted antigen that has several well defined epitopes is highly innovative. The methodology to accurately count the number of naive T cells in the whole mouse (we talk about 10-100 cells per mouse!) is impressive. Looking at endogenous response, without transfer of monoclonal TCR-Tg T cells is really fundamental. The way how authors look at two tissues - lymphoid (lymph nodes) and lung - is important. The use of LPS injection as a model for lung injury is interesting as it also allows to look at actual pathology (mouse weight) as a medically relevant read-out. The text is short (perhaps in some places too short, see below for comments) and figures are relatively clear (see comments). Having an experimental layout for how the mice were treated, along with what was harvested for each experiment was very useful. Finally, having many different lines of mice is very impressive! Major Concerns I do not understand how transfer of naive T cells results in pathology in the lung (Fig 1 results). Per basics of immunology, 3 signals are needed to activate T cells - i.e., there is a need of inflammation to induce immune response and trafficking to the lung. Perhaps activated T cells were transferred but that was not clear from experimental design in Fig 1. Authors must provide better rationale of how transfer of naive T cells causes IgM in BAL to increase. Tracking immune response of transferred cells (e.g., activation markers, division history by CFSE, cell numbers in LNs/spleen over time) would be needed. Also, it would be very important to perform titration experiments to show how the number of transferred T cells impacts pathology. Similarly, why day 7 was chosen as the point to measure the endogenous response was not clear. While measurements of T cells in lymph nodes and spleen are typically efficient (most cells are recovered), isolation of activated T cells from nonlymphoid tissues, especially the lung is highly inefficient and may be biased (some subsets could be better isolated than others, PMID: 25957682). Confirming the results of Treg bias in lung samples must be done with using microscopy. Furthermore, when T cells are isolated from tissues due to contamination with the blood, cells in the circulation may be detected as in the parenchyma (24385150). Experiments must be repeated to include intravascular staining to separate cells in the blood vs. parenchyma to indicate that Tregs in the lung are in fact in the lung. I found it weird that the authors claim that 2W-specific Tregs are responsible for suppression of endogenous responses to 2W upon antigen+adjuvant injection and yet, depletion of Tregs did not result in a new response. A simpler interpretation is induction of anergy in endogenous T cells upon exposure to Ag in the absence of strong inflammation. Text must be carefully curated to avoid bias towards one favorite explanation. Focus on SLOs and lung is clear but I wonder if using another control peripheral tissue that did not express the antigen could be useful. For example, measuring T cell accumulation in the liver may be a useful control. It was not clear if  expression of OVA is actually restricted to the lung. Perhaps some more thorough analysis of other tissues would be helpful to verify the absence of leakiness of the gene expression. Minor concerns Having numbers for lines in the paper could allow for better referencing to specific statements made in the paper. While for most immunologists Tregs are FoxP3, some younger researchers may not know this. Mentioning that this is how you define Tregs would be useful. Also, assessing the function of these T cells would be useful. Please do not use “ns” or “**” to denote statistical significance. Use actual p values, e.g., p=0.34 or p=0.012. Additionally, indicating fold difference between groups (effect size) could be also useful. In introduction: Whether autoimmune responses are driven by naive T cells or by cross-reactive memory T cells is unclear. Cross-reactivity may be a simpler explanation given that memory T cells may require lower thresholds for activation. Authors should describe better different epitopes used in the construct, e.g., gp66 is from LCMV. Why did authors use gp66-specific CD4 T cells and not OVA-specific OTII cells? Are the results the same is using T cells of a different specificity? Are the detected Tregs derived from the thymus or are these “converted” naive T cells to the Treg phenotype? I don’t think that the current data allow to discriminate between these alternatives. When indicating difference in expansion in the Results section, please indicate how much (how many fold) is that expansion. How is the lung injury by LPS dependent on the LPS dose? Perhaps this needs to be discussed. I wonder that measuring kinetics of response, e.g., before day 7 and after, may be useful. We know that exposure to self antigens typically results in deletion of naive CD8 T cells (10843383) Which specific LNs were isolated? This probably should be listed in materials and methods section. I wonder if plotting some data as paired (e.g., Fig 1 - 2W vs. SMARTA) could reveal some additional information. How were Tr1 cells gated? Some flow cytometry graphs may be useful here (Suppl Fig S2) Suppl Fig 3 would benefit from experimental design panel.",2023-04-01T23:15:29,vitalyvganusov,Vitaly V.

I am a bit confused by the approach for neighborhood definition: if I understand correctly you search for the w vector with the maximum absolute correlation with ∆g, and then you sort the cells along w. But why not instead just sort the cells according to ∆g? 2. If I understand correctly, the neighborhood is strongly driven by the two cells that define the v to which the selected w corresponds. Have you tested the robustness of the results to this choice? How would you go about testing that? For example, what happens if you remove all cells that belong to  the neighborhood defined for g and then run the process again? Are there no DEGs? Or maybe you can find a different neighborhood that represent cells that are affected by the contrasting variable in a different way as compared to the cells in the original neighborhood. 3. According to your understanding/experience what happens in cases where for a specific gene g and a specific contrast, there are two cell populations for which there is differential expression population A includes cells for which the expression increases by a lot and population B includes cells for which the expression increases by a little? What about if the signs are opposite (i.e. expression increases for population A and decreases for population B)? To clarify, when I say population, I am thinking of some cell type/state. 4. I think it would be helpful to explicitly define what does ∆gQg represents. I assume it is the submatrix of ∆ that includes the row corresponding to g and columns representing cells in Q, but (assuming I got it right) in my opinion it would help to be explicit. 5. I think it would be interesting to see the cumulative Z-score curves for a collection of genes (representing neighborhood of a variety of sizes). What is the expectation in terms of the shape of these curves? Are there outlier cases? Is this something that could be used to identify cases in which the defined neighborhood may be suboptimal? 6. More generally I think the paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of approaches to examine the results and identify cases in which the embedding in general and/or specific neighborhoods may be suboptimal.

We have some recommendations to make the manuscript clearer and some questions, which we’d be grateful if you could answer. The results include a wide range of tissues from mice, rats, and humans. At times, it is difficult to follow how many samples (independent people/animals) were used and which data corresponds to which specific sample, this is an issue given that some data are from tissues known to have higher/lower HCD contents e.g., old vs young participants, TI vs TII dominant muscle fibres, and healthy vs diseased populations. As the focus is on characterising HCD content, the exact source used to determine that content is important. For example, human heart values are from patients undergoing heart surgery, it is not clear what pathology these participants had and how that could affect HCD content, or whether contents would differ in compartments other than the right atrial appendage; human adipose tissue are combined values from lean, and obese people undergoing surgery; liver samples are from people with obesity undergoing gastric bypass surgery, it is possible that they also have other pathologies (e.g., NAFLD) here; and kidney samples are from cancer patients undergoing nephropathy, while you mention that tissue was sampled away from the tumor (in cases of cancer), it is possible that the metabolic changes (pH and glycolytic flux) influenced the tissue HCD contents, and it should be clear this values may not represent healthy human kidney values. All participants should be described in full, especially for factors that are known to influence HCD content (sex, age, BMI, disease state/pathology etc.). As well as this, the beta-alanine supplementation dose needs to be made clear, as this will influence tissue and circulating contents. This additional information could either be fully described in the figure legend, or perhaps with a summary table that contains the various populations, characteristics, and the figure that the data corresponds to. Interpretation and conclusions should also reflect the participant characteristics e.g., HCD concentrations reflect tissue from X, Y, Z pathology or population, rather than assuming these are representative of healthy human values. There is a really interesting finding that using a CARNS1 KO tissue matrix leads to much lower HCD estimations than using water. This has implications for all prior HCD content research, and potentially means we need to correct prior estimations for measurement error. An example of this are the data in Fig 1F, where skeletal muscle concentrations are approx. 2 mM w/w, which is substantially lower than prior research, including the current authors own HMRS data. It would be great for the authors to expand on this, explain the method in detail and the importance of using a CARNS1 KO tissue matrix, and how this should influence future work. The line numbers below correspond to the original version of the paper (which has since been updated with a newer version). Some descriptors in the text appear to overstate the corresponding data e.g., lines 89-90 ‘HCD levels were overestimated by 2-3-fold’ – this is true for the rat CNS data, but the human muscle data difference is an approx. 90% increase. Line 124 also states ‘2-fold higher CARNS1 mRNA’ – but the actual difference here is approx. 60-65%. Line 168 ‘no CARNS1 could be detected’ (in non-excitable tissues). The corresponding data in Figure 4, appears to show a CARNS1 protein band in the adipose/kidney tissue lane – of a similar magnitude to the heart tissue lane. Was this below the limit of detection? Further, it appears that there was very little (perhaps insufficient) protein loaded in the heart and adipose tissue lanes. Did you explore whether this was a measurement issue? There are some inconsistencies in the data presented in Figure 7. The percentages reported in panel A do not match the corresponding data e.g., BAL/NAC increases as +97/199%. Panels A and B have 11 carnosine datapoints, whereas panel C has ~42 datapoints. It is unclear why these numbers should differ, as they appear to be from the same samples. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify this disparity. The paper uses the term ‘systematic approach’ and estimates that 99.1% of total HCDs are contained in skeletal muscle. We are unsure the language should be that strident, given the range of tissues measured, the overall small N per population, and that various tissues are from pathological tissues. From the analysis, it would be possible to say that ‘of the tissues measured’… 99.1% of the HCD content was found in skeletal muscle samples. The methods state that the human CNS tissue was from ‘non-demented controls, indicating the absence of neurological and psychiatric disease’ – was absence of disease confirmed from the participant characteristics? If not, then the term ‘non-demented’ may not be indicate of people free from neurological and psychiatric disease. Figure 7. From the methods used (i.e., NAC not labelled), is it possible to determine that this was specifically NAC release/reuptake, or could it be reflective of a general appearance? The discussion mentions ‘there appears to be a relationship between CARNS1 expression and HCD content on a whole-body level… However, the correlation between CARNS1 expression and HCD content was not perfect, suggesting that there might be inter-organ exchange…’ – the statement appears to relate to data from Figure 4, but it is not clear where the statistical analyses of these correlations/relationships are.

The following are suggestions from a group of students from The Sainsbury Laboratory who read and discussed your pre-print with great interest: It would be helpful to provide an explanation for the large variation in quantities of hits for each selected LRR-RLK in Figure 1 and define which species are represented for each LRR-RLK hit from your pipeline for added transparency. Additionally, could the small number of hits found for some LRR-RLKs indicate higher divergence between proteins and thus a difficulty in identifying more members? We were wondering if it makes sense to query the phylogenetically represented database (1K Transcriptomes) with a Hidden Markov Model based on LRR-RLKs from a small subset of species that are not phylogenetically representative. We suggest using ""kinase"" or ""intracellular"" domain instead of ""RLK domain"" in the paper for better clarity. Could you please provide more transparency on how you selected the LRR-RLKs you studied in the paper? Ideally, using members from more than one clade and being clear about clade/subfamily/subclade notation would be beneficial. Additionally, having equal representation from both functional groups (development and defence) would allow presenting a more comprehensive conclusion on the comparison between LRR-RLKs involved in development and defence. Do most genomes have more developmental LRR-RLKs than defence LRR-RLKs? We wanted to know if your hypothesis about the divergent rates between defence and developmental receptors would change if the defence LRR-RLKs bind to ligands that do not quickly evolve since LRR-RLKs including FLS2 and EFR bind to highly conserved epitopes from pathogens, not effectors. The main finding of the paper that there was no significant difference between LRR domain evolution in developmental and defence LRR-RLKs is not well-reflected in the title. Including a discussion of the ligands for each receptor and whether these are present natively in the plant would be useful along with Figure 3. We hope these suggestions are helpful, and we appreciate your effort in advancing the understanding of LRR-RLK evolution.",2023-03-29T17:06:48,tslpreprintgroup,TSL pre-print group,10.1101/2023.03.13.532436,Asymmetric evolution of protein domains in the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) family of plant developmental coordinators,"Jarrett Man, Thomas Harrington, Kyra Lally, Madelaine E.
