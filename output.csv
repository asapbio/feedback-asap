https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.08.463751v1#comment-6804423117,biorxivstage,0,"This study introduces a NanoLuc-based Sec-signal reporter to assess whether the Type IVa pilus system (T4aPS) contributes to non-pilin protein secretion in Synechocystis. The reporter itself is a valuable methodological advance, offering markedly improved sensitivity over traditional secretion assays. However, several experimental and presentation issues limit the strength and generalizability of the authors’ biological conclusions. The central claim that T4aPS components are dispensable for secretion is based entirely on a single engineered substrate, the TfAA10A–NanoLuc fusion. Because endogenous secreted proteins may use distinct Sec signal or rely on alternative export mechanisms. Many of the T4aPS mutants display regulatory and envelope abnormalities, yet the study does not quantify NanoLuc expression across strains. Consequently, differences in luminescence may reflect altered expression rather than true differences in export efficiency. Normalization of secretion output to OD750 complicates interpretation. The authors note that aggregation affects OD measurements, and aggregation varies considerably among the mutants. Despite RbcL being present in supernatants, this cannot rule out subtle lysis, selective leakage, or extracellular degradation of NanoLuc, leaving open the possibility that luminescence does not strictly represent secreted protein. The subcellular fractionation experiments are promising but lack purity markers, loading controls, and quantitative analysis, making mechanistic conclusions uncertain. The statement that the PilQ secretin is unnecessary for secretion is weakened by the absence of functional validation demonstrating loss of PilQ activity in the ΔpilQ strain. Similarly, the proposed mechanism for enhanced secretion in ΔpilA1 remains speculative without supporting measurements of Sec-pathway components or alternative Sec substrates. Presentation issues also reduce clarity. Several figures lack color and contrast, limiting interpretability, and some figure descriptions have methodological information. Typographical inconsistencies and minimal statistical reporting, combined with reliance on a single 24-hour endpoint, further detract from the manuscript’s rigor. Overall, the NanoLuc reporter represents a promising tool for cyanobacterial secretion studies, but the biological interpretations require additional controls, expanded substrate testing, more robust normalization, and clearer data presentation. The study supports only the conclusion that this Sec-signal NanoLuc reporter does not depend on the T4aPS under the tested conditions, it does not justify broader claims about cyanobacterial non-pilin secretion pathways.",2025-12-03T04:29:43,,Susan,,,,

You also use a new comparative approach by testing sounds from many species, which makes the work original and valuable. An introduction should be added to generally speak about the topic of bioacoustics, and the  reasoning behind the similarities in acoustic preference. Regarding the methodology, the design is appropriate to establish the correlation , however a main limitation is that the sounds used for the study don't reflect the natural context of the source. Digitally editing them and isolating them from their natural environment, could make the subject’s preferences biased. Also, because they came from different sources, it is difficult to ensure the uniformity of the quality and volume, which could also add a bias towards the preferences. Finally, the study doesn't control for a possible familiarity with the sounds in the participants, which could also add to the bias of the results. This should be added in your discussion. Concerning the results and their interpretation, there is a risk of overestimating the conclusion about the shared acoustic preferences between humans and non-human animals. This is because the percentage of agreement between the two was 56.4%. Even though this was statistically significant, it's still a very limited effect size. Moreover, the mechanisms of decision between humans and non-human animals when choosing a more “beautiful” sound should be supported by the fact that both groups prefer a certain acoustic feature. However, the results show the contrary, proving that specific acoustic features have no effect in sharing the same auditory taste. Finally, the group of sounds from species used in the study is small and not very diverse), which could undermine the generalization that humans share acoustic preferences with animals. The overall idea of the study is very interesting and it's not that well researched, showing great potential. Also, the main points made were communicated effectively in a way that is understandable. As a final suggestion, a short summary of the methodology employed could be added to the abstract.",2025-12-03T03:45:39,sandrosantillan,Sandro Santillan,,,,

This integrative approach, combining docking, ADMET prediction, and molecular dynamics, is conceptually valuable and could provide meaningful preliminary insights. However, several methodological aspects require clarification or refinement to ensure that the conclusions presented are scientifically robust and reproducible. From a methodological perspective, the docking section would benefit from substantial improvement. The study does not report a redocking of the co-crystallized ligand nor provide RMSD values, making it impossible to determine whether the docking protocol can accurately reproduce known binding poses. Furthermore, several essential parameters—such as exhaustiveness, number of runs or modes, pose-selection criteria, and software version are not specified, limiting reproducibility. Although the grid box dimensions are reported, their rationale is not explained, particularly for α-synuclein, an intrinsically disordered protein that lacks a stable binding pocket. Using a rigid docking protocol for such a target requires additional justification or alternative strategies. The ADMET analysis also presents inconsistencies. Several LD₅₀ values appear implausible, suggesting potential issues with molecular input files or prediction settings. Moreover, some interpretations, such as characterizing compounds as “non-toxic if ingested"", are too strong for in silico predictions, which should be framed as preliminary and subject to experimental validation. The molecular dynamics section exhibits additional methodological ambiguities. The simulation box is reported with units incompatible with atomistic MD, and essential parameters such as ionic concentration, thermostat and barostat conditions, NVT/NPT equilibration steps, and time-step are not described. Only a single trajectory is presented without replicates, and the structural analyses are limited to basic RMSD and RMSF plots, without energetic evaluations such as MM-GBSA. These omissions hinder assessment of the stability and reliability of the proposed protein–ligand complexes. Finally, several presentation issues affect clarity. Some tables lack units or clear column descriptions, and the selection criteria for the four compounds included in the interaction tables are not explained, despite docking fifteen molecules. In summary, the manuscript addresses an interesting question and uses relevant targets, but significant methodological clarification and refinement are necessary before the results can support the conclusions drawn.",2025-12-03T01:12:35,disqus_sGZ7GGM5Cu,Marcelo Salas,,,,

As part of our academic training, we are analyzing recent preprints and publications to strengthen our critical understanding of genomics. In this context, we would like to share our observations. We recognize the important advances achieved in your zebrafish genome study, particularly the closure of gaps and the integration of third-generation sequencing technologies. Nevertheless, we believe certain methodological aspects require further consideration. First, the figures presented in the preprint aren’t of the highest quality, making it difficult to see the graphics and plot names. Since figures are a central element in communicating scientific results, the image resolution is crucial to fully appreciate the data and conclusions. Second, the exclusive reliance on Verkko as the assembler reduces reproducibility and methodological robustness. While Verkko is powerful, particularly for Telomere-to-Telomere projects, benchmarking against widely adopted assemblers such as Flye or Canu, or even Wengan is essential. Without such comparisons, it is difficult to determine whether the reported improvements in contiguity and gap closure are genuine biological advances or artifacts of the chosen software. We suggest doing further analysis and comparison of assemblers in order to have a more robust pipeline. Third, we note the absence of detailed controls and verifications that would strengthen confidence in the assembly. These include: (1) confirmation of the absence of paternal contribution through comparative genotyping of TU mothers, AB sperm, and doubled-haploid adults; (2) verification of ploidy and mosaicism by karyotyping (3) cell culture controls such as reporting passage number, mycoplasma testing, and fibroblast karyotyping to ensure genomic stability. The pangenome analysis, while mentioned, is not fully aligned with the study’s main objective of generating a gap-free reference. Broader and more systematic characterization of genetic diversity would be required before extending conclusions to the whole pangenome. In conclusion, we recognize the importance of your work and its contribution to zebrafish genomics. Incorporating benchmarking, and systematic controls would further enhance the reproducibility, credibility, and long-term impact of this valuable resource.",2025-12-02T23:22:28,jimenapatriciagiraldoflores,Jimena Patricia Giraldo Flores,,,,

A couple of things you might consider for the next version: the Introduction would really benefit from explicit hypotheses, just so readers know what the expected contrasts were between phenology and morphology. Some of the modeling assumptions (equal evolutionary variances, missing environmental forcing) could use a clearer justification too. And the transition to the empirical motifs comes a bit abruptly, the Doñana system is very seasonal, so V+ motifs might appear for several reasons besides coevolution. But overall, really interesting work. Looking forward to seeing where it goes next.

The manuscript is well written (despite being quite technical for an aging-specific audience) and the method is interesting, but the need for the application of GANs to this problem is not fully justified. In addition, the evaluation of the model's performance is as rigorous as it could be, and it is not clear whether the model is truly capable of generalizing to unseen timepoints of specific individuals or is simply learning to interpolate/extrapolate at the population level. ## Major comments 1. It is known that several aging phenotypes are shared across a population with fairly moderate reproducibility/variability - which is what enables the establishment of population-level aging clocks which are mostly linear models. Therefore a baseline to compare to could be a linear regression model which accounts for individual-specific differences such as a linear mixed model that is trained on the same covariates as input, but seeing only a fraction of the timepoints and simply inter- or extrapolates to a held out timepoint. Another benchmark to beat could be a gaussian process regression model, which is well suited to modeling temporal data and supports irregular timelines and missing data. These models would be important baselines to assess the generative model's ability to capture individual-level trends rather than simply population-level trends. 2. The evaluation of the generated timepoints for various individuals is not rigorous enough. The simple quantification of a score with an arbitrary threshold is too lenient as it does not capture individual-specific trends, but can report inflate performance simply by capturing population-level trends. A more quantitative assessment of the model's ability to capture individual-level trends is needed. This could be done by evaluating the mean square error, mean absolute error, Pearson correlation and R^2 between predicted and true values at the held-out timepoint, as well as evaluating the ability of the model to rank individuals according to their predicted phenotype values at the held-out timepoint. Another approach could be to perform a clustering analysis of the predicted vs true values to see if the model can capture subgroups of individuals with similar aging trajectories. 3. I am not sure the model is truly capable of generalizing across time because it always sees timepoints 2 and 4 as inputs and predicts timepoints 5 and 8 as targets. So it may not necessarily ever learn to generalize to an unseen time index as it could simply learns the mapping of 2,4 to 5,8. What is being evaluated is therefore only a test of whether the model can inter- and extra-polate across individuals for these fixed visit times. In addition, the conditioning timepoints are assymetric (2 and 4 are both early). Related to my previous point, if the cohort shows predictable average decline between t4 to t5 and t5 to t8, then a simple baseline (like a linear mixed model or gaussian process) should capture this well. It would be interesting to see how the model performs when trained and evaluated on different timepoints. The hold out timepoint (7) does provide some evidence but is not sufficient to demonstrate generalization across time as the performance of predicting that one timepoint could be easily interpolated from the others at the population level and not at the individual level. ## Minor comments 1. Some abbreviations need to be defined at first use (e.g. SIR). 2. The methods section could more explicitly describe that the timepoint 7 is held-out during training and only used for evaluation. 3. The specification of the various 'strata' is really not clear.",2025-11-28T21:08:51,,Andre Rendeiro,,,,

As FNA is a less invasive method for obtaining samples from patients, the article's findings would provide new insights for researchers and clinicians. Another important result of the article is that the immune cell profile of a single reactive ALN appears to reflect the patient's entire immune status in the axilla. The article has explained that FNA itself has sufficient leukocytes for comprehensive cell immunophenotyping of reactive ALN. The research question was well explained, and the results were presented clearly. The results of the study have given significant and novel information about the concept. All conclusions are well-supported by the results. Results obtained from different directions have backed each other up. Results might be supported more effectively by using control groups more in experiments. Yields of the animal study might be stronger if it were applied to animals with breast cancer.

Here are our highlights: Including nutrient availability shifts the focus of antibiotic control from ""more drug vs less drug"" to how the population's vulnerability state can be altered as a mechanism driving extinction. The reinforcement learning (RL) agent discovers strategies that humans would be unlikely to design, such as giving nutrients before antibiotics and pausing drug application until cells return to a susceptible state, illustrating how machine learning-guided therapy can find hidden leverage points. It's unlikely that clinicians will have access to ""full-state"" information like subpopulation composition or proteome sector fractions. By restricting the agent's observations to the population growth rate, the authors demonstrate that RL-based population control is feasible even with severely limited observability. Rigorously testing the generalizability of the RL method shows that it can discover principles of susceptibility that are broadly applicable. Uncovering such principles enables RL to propose treatment strategies that leverage fundamental cellular physiology, rather than simply fitting a training scenario.",2025-11-25T21:14:55,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

We like how the authors emphasize that the oral microbiome is relatively stable over time compared to other body sites. We are excited by the possibility that, in principle, this stability could support individual longitudinal surveillance efforts that could lead to the discovery of predictive signatures with greater generalizability (accounting for individual baseline variability).",2025-11-25T15:00:15,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

Here are our highlights: This study provides a clear and thoughtful evaluation of whether modern deep generative models can meaningfully improve ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR). The authors explore a compelling idea: that variational autoencoders (VAE), trained on homologous protein families, might capture epistatic interactions that classical site-independent evolutionary models omit. A key highlight is the demonstration that VAE latent spaces do recover meaningful phylogenetic structure. The authors show that relationships among sequences are encoded coherently in the latent representation, suggesting that deep models can learn informative global organization from sequence data - an encouraging insight for future machine-learning approaches to molecular evolution.Another important contribution is the comparison across simulated evolutionary scenarios, with and without epistasis. Across all cases, classical maximum-likelihood ASR methods outperform the VAE-based approach. Finally, the study identifies the decoder as a key bottleneck, offering a constructive direction forward for the field. Even when the latent space contains strong phylogenetic signal, reconstructing accurate ancestral sequences remains challenging. The authors highlight a concrete opportunity for model development and for integrating phylogenetic constraints more explicitly into deep generative architectures.",2025-11-25T11:41:10,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

It’s really exciting to see “the molecular face”. You made a very intriguing experiment with the partially NCP unwrapping and received a hopeful result on it. One more interesting feature is relative to PARP1 trapping mode in the presence of different inhibitors that is a direct demonstration of protein holds-on on DNA. However, after discussion your paper on a lab seminar I have got several questions that probably arise due to I am not a specialist in optical tweezer and confocal microscopy fields. I hope that you could clarify it for me. 1. I couldn’t find in the text how the dwell and gap times were converted to k(off) and k(on app). Is it just the reciprocal value of the projection of the inflection point of the sigmoid approximation onto the time axis? Additionally, is it correct the kon app = k(on)/C(PARP1)? How did you estimate the DNA concentration under single molecule conditions? I also could not find the PARP1 concentration used in the experiments. Is that 0.1 nM? 2. The time resolution of microscope used in the work is 1/10s. One of the basic assumptions for result interpretation was the absence of association/dissociation acts of the DNA-protein complexes during this time period. As far as spontaneous collisions are limited by diffusion and can happen 10^9 times/s, how do you estimate the probability of reassociation of dissociated complexes during the dwell periods? To exclude the reassociation did you try to transfer the trapped DNA with bounded PARP1 molecules to the channel without PARP1 (with buffer) with keeping the flow? In my opinion it could allow to avoid PARP1 reassociation events from the calculation. 3. In the text you do not discuss potential dimerization of PARP1 and PARP2 under DNA/nucleosome bounding. Although, it seems to me that it is important for Kd calculations. 4. According to your data, the binding manner of PARP1 with nick-sites is different in frames of one DNA molecule. Part of tracks demonstrate a long dwell and gap periods; another part is characterized short dwell and gap periods. Did you take it into account in any way at the constant calculations or results interpretation? Moreover, on the kymograph of PARP2 binding there are only two nick sites from seven were found in association, and due to long dwell periods, it led to low Kd calculated value. Could you somehow comment your interpretation of the obtained result and the feasibility of using calculation method? 5. I didn't find in the text and references what kind of plasmids did you use for the transient overexpression of the fluorescent-tagged proteins. I will be very grateful for clarification these questions for me. Thanks in advance, Mikhail",2025-11-24T08:18:05,disqus_viPf6DEIDr,Mikhail Kutuzov,,,,

Assessing endophenotypes solely in wild-type mice, rather than in models that exhibit a clear deficit relative to wild-type and can therefore show selective rescue, can be fundamentally misleading when inferring therapeutic potential. If psilocybin alters behaviour in wild-type animals, this may actually reflect a deleterious or maladaptive effect, given that many of these behaviours are evolutionarily conserved and serve important adaptive functions. For example, consider repetitive grooming. In wild-type mice, grooming is a healthy, essential behavior that maintains hygiene. It is only when this behaviour becomes excessive — as observed in SAPAP3 knockout mice, where compulsive grooming results in skin lesions and self-injury — that it becomes pathological. In such a model, restoring grooming to wild-type levels would represent a meaningful, therapeutically relevant effect. But if one were to test only wild-type mice, observe no change, and conclude that psilocybin lacks translational relevance for compulsive behaviour, such a conclusion would be unwarranted. Conversely, if grooming were reduced in wild-type mice, this could itself be maladaptive, as it disrupts a necessary and evolutionarily important behaviour. Statistical constraints, such as floor and ceiling effects, further complicate interpretation in wild-type cohorts depending on the behavioural assay employed. Altogether, this is a crucial point that warrants careful consideration when designing and interpreting preclinical behavioural studies aimed at evaluating true therapeutic potential. Finally, I would like to congratulate all of the scientists involved in this impressive multi-institutional effort.

While pooling can reduce sequencing costs and simplify workflow, it also eliminates all variation at the individual level. This variation is essential for understanding how thermal stres and pathogen infection can impact hosts differently. Individual bees vary in microbiome composiiton, immune status, body size, and infection intensity, and these variations are biologically meaningful. When you average individuals inot a singular pooled sample, it blurs whether observed microbial shifts reflect consistent responses across bees or the cominance of a single/few outlier(s). This loss of clarity can affect nearly every analysis presented in the manuscript, including alpha and beta diversity estimates, infection quantification, and the interpretation of taxa associated with particular treatments. Even though the manuscript briefly acknowledges this limitation, they frame it mainly as a reduction in sequencing resolution rather than a core biological constraint. The manuscript would benefit from a clearer justification for pooling, whether it was due to logistics, cost, survivorship, or colony level focus. Also a more explicit discussion of how pooling influences the interpretation of microbiome patterns would greatly clarify this inconsistency.

We have already resolved the question you pose: ""But we are unsure which came first: is it the proteins that bring these ordered lipids with them, or do the lipids form domains into which the proteins partition?"" Indeed, we built a theoretical framework where one of the central theories is that lipids do not form stable subregions that subsequently recruit proteins ( https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-024-01849-6). The answer lies with lipid fingerprints ( https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00143). Suppose lipid-lipid interactions were strong enough to form platforms large enough to accommodate proteins (the evidence for this is very poor, by the way). It wouldn't matter. The idea that the proteins and lipids are collectively present in the final structure suggests that the proteins have preferential interactions with the lipids, so there would have to be a very good reason why the lipids would ""ignore"" the proteins such that they cluster and then recruit the proteins in a sequential manner. If this is insufficient to cover all cases (for example, if the proteins are not initially present in the membrane when the lipids supposedly cluster), there are many other reasons why this cannot occur. For example, if the lipid platforms are ordered, one would expect there to be a free energy barrier for protein entry. I could go on and on, but there is really no need. It is a thermodynamically absurd notion. This sequential mechanism was popularized by the original lipid raft theory. Since it was false, lipid rafts underwent many ad hoc modifications and should now be regarded as pseudoscience ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/397646378_Lessons_from_pseudoscience_in_biology). I should also mention that the phase separation narrative (which I debunk here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17201253), and Kusumi et al.'s picket fence/tiered mesoscale domain model are also wrong. I think you will understand why after reading lipid fingerprints ( https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00143) and the proteolipid code ( https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-024-01849-6). Since I am challenging so many of their beloved theories, the lipid raft people, who still run the place, do not want you to know that the proteolipid code exists.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.10.658907v2#comment-6799391350,biorxivstage,0,"This study explores how Pheidole bergi colonies are distributed across habitats and spatial scales in the Monte desert, and how natural and anthropogenic environmental variation affects colony density and spatial structure. Long-term data reveal strong preference for protected algarrobal habitat; major density declines through drought years; density-dependent shifts from aggregation to more dispersed patterns; consistent microhabitat selection toward inter-patch borders and open patches. This is a promising and well-executed spatial ecology study, but several issues must be addressed for clarity and robustness. The largest concerns involve justification of biological assumptions, narrative organization, overinterpretation of environmental drivers, and insufficient integration of the anthropogenic component. MAJOR ISSUES 1.	The assumption that each nest corresponds to a separate colony must be justified This is the main flaw of this study. The analyses assume that each nest entrance represents an independent colony, but this assumption is never justified. Many Pheidole species are polydomous, meaning that multiple nests may belong to the same colony. If P. bergi is polydomous, nest counts may not correspond to colony counts, spatial clustering may reflect intra-colony nest structure rather than interactions among colonies, observed “repulsion” could represent spacing among satellite nests, and density declines may reflect contraction of colony structure rather than colony mortality. This has direct implications for all spatial analyses. Given that the authors note that little is known about the natural history of P. bergi, this issue needs to be addressed explicitly. The manuscript should clarify whether P. bergi is known to be monodomous or polydomous, how this was assessed in the field, and what implications this uncertainty may have for interpreting spatial patterns. 2. The manuscript does not explicitly link its predictions to its results and discussion The Introduction presents several detailed, scale-specific predictions regarding habitat-level differences in aggregation, drought-induced density-dependent thinning, mosaic-driven microhabitat selection, predicted shifts in inter-colony interactions, and responses to anthropogenic disturbance. However, these predictions are not revisited consistently in the Results or Discussion. In several sections it is unclear which prediction a given result addresses, or whether a result supports or contradicts the authors' expectations. Reorganizing the Results and Discussion using a clear prediction–finding–interpretation structure would substantially improve narrative clarity and help readers understand how each analysis addresses the study’s questions. 3. Anthropogenic variation is stated as a major objective but receives insufficient analysis The Introduction frames the study as examining abundance, habitat associations, and spatial arrangement across both natural and anthropogenic sources of environmental variation. Yet the anthropogenic component receives very limited treatment. The “grazed algarrobal” appears only in a single 2021 sampling, with no information provided about the intensity or history of grazing, and anthropogenic predictions are not explicitly stated. In the Discussion, the potential effects of grazing and dirt-road disturbance are mentioned only briefly, without deeper engagement or clear linkage back to the stated objectives. Clarifying the expected ecological effects of grazing and dirt roads, showing how those expectations were tested, and revisiting these comparisons explicitly in the discussion would bring the manuscript into better alignment with its claims. 4. A spatial overview map is essential but missing An important limitation is the absence of a spatial overview map. Because spatial scale and spatial context are central to the study, a map showing the locations of all dirt-road transects, he positions of dirt-road transects (D, F, D1, D2, F1, T, L, P1, P2, M), and the two permanent grids (J, V), habitat boundaries such as algarrobal, sand dunes, and grazed lands, and approximate distances among sites is essential for interpreting habitat comparisons and understanding how environmental heterogeneity relates to the observed patterns. Without such a map, it is difficult for readers to evaluate the spatial independence of sampling areas or the relevance of local heterogeneity. Including a map would greatly improve the clarity of the manuscript. 5. Environmental drivers underlying heterogeneous intensity patterns are inferred but not measured Along the dirt-road transects, for example, environmental attributes such as soil texture, moisture, or vegetation structure are invoked to explain variation in colony distribution, but these variables were not measured. Thus the interpretations rely on assumptions rather than data. The manuscript would benefit from acknowledging more explicitly that interpretations of road-scale heterogeneity are speculative unless environmental covariates are incorporated into the analyses. 6. Gibbs point-process model interpretation requires additional clarification These models are a strength of the manuscript, but their biological meaning is not always clear. The significance of positive versus negative interaction parameters may not be obvious to readers unfamiliar with point-process modeling. In addition, the first-order and second-order terms operate at similar spatial scales, leading to partial confounding that complicates interpretation. Although this confounding is acknowledged late in the Discussion, it would be more helpful to flag it earlier, so that readers can interpret the model results with appropriate caution. Providing more biological explanation of what the model components represent would enhance accessibility. 7. The long-term population decline is compelling but causality is overstated The manuscript describes a greater than fifty percent decline in colony density between 2001 and 2019, and an additional approximately forty percent decline between 2019 and 2025. These changes are attributed largely to drought. While this is plausible, causal claims are currently too strong given the absence of direct soil moisture data, prey availability measurements, reproductive output data, or queen survival data. Phrasing should be adjusted to reflect that the observed pattern is consistent with drought effects rather than demonstrating causality, and alternative explanations such as detectability changes, nest dormancy, or colony relocation should be acknowledged. MINOR ISSUES 1. The introduction overextends and lacks a clear conceptual framework The introduction reviews many ecological processes (competition, habitat heterogeneity, disturbance, droughts) but does not clearly articulate which mechanisms the authors expected to dominate at each scale (macro vs micro), or how these mechanisms generate distinct predictions. Explicitly state what processes are expected to drive spatial patterns at macro scale (abiotic heterogeneity vs density-dependent thinning) vs micro scale (territoriality, vegetation mosaic), and indicate which predictions are tied to drought, habitat type, or population density. 2. The macro-scale interpretation equates heterogeneous intensity with ecological responses, but the ecological drivers remain untested Along dirt roads, the intensity of colonies is strongly heterogeneous in algarrobal but not in grazed or dune habitats. However, the manuscript interprets these heterogeneities as linked to soil or vegetation structure, but these environmental variables were not quantified. The interpretation of “inverse density-dependent thinning” from 2019–2025 is plausible but speculative without a formal test. Acknowledge explicitly that without measured habitat covariates along the roads, the environmental interpretation is inferential. Clarify limitations of attributing density changes to specific drivers. 3.	Visual presentation of spatial results needs improvement Several figures (especially 2, 3, and 4) are extremely dense. Overlapping confidence envelopes make interpretation difficult. Lack of legends for symbols or shading in some subpanels. Figure 5 has too many components on a single page. Simplify or divide composite figures. Ensure that interpretation of Ripley’s L and pair-correlation graphs is clearly explained in captions. Highlight key distances at which patterns deviate from CSR. WRITING QUALITY The manuscript is written in generally clear and grammatically correct English, and the overall academic tone is appropriate. However, the prose is often excessively dense, with very long paragraphs and sentences that embed multiple ideas at once. The abstract is longer than necessary and would benefit from reduction. Parts of the Introduction are dense and could be streamlined. Important predictions, results, and conceptual transitions are sometimes buried within complex constructions, which makes the narrative harder to follow. Key terms and modeling approaches would benefit from brief explanatory context. In addition, the Discussion section is unusually long and occasionally repetitive, with several arguments stated multiple times across different paragraphs, while others are presented with more certainty than the data justify. This dilutes the impact of the key findings and makes it harder for readers to follow the logical flow of the authors’ interpretations. Overall, the manuscript would benefit from substantial stylistic polishing aimed at improving clarity, structure, and readability for organization and flow. Reference formatting should be checked for consistency. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the manuscript is based on a strong dataset with considerable potential. Addressing the issues outlined above, especially the need for clear hypothesis integration, fuller treatment of anthropogenic variation, inclusion of a spatial map, justification of assumptions about colony structure, and more cautious interpretation of environmental drivers, will substantially strengthen the scientific clarity and impact of the work.",2025-11-21T01:22:49,disqus_cfq1Qgrrr6,Aline Machado,,,,

Over the past years, this group has substantially shaped the field: from their highly cited foundational paper introducing the use of covariance matrices to derive cortical gradients, to a series of successful application studies in developmental neuroscience, and to the release of user-friendly software that has made this framework accessible to the broader community. The present perspective nicely complements this established body of work (with minimal - but existing redundancy) by contextualizing the framework within current methodological and conceptual developments. On the computational side, the authors appropriately acknowledge the importance of the equi-volume principle and the contributions of Waehnert et al. for cortical layerification. Given the centrality of this topic in their discussion, it could further strengthen the paper to briefly mention the known limitations of equi-voluming—such as its incomplete handling of cortical geometry, questions about column smoothness, and other challenges highlighted in recent work (e.g., Computing geometric layers and columns on continuously improving human (f)MRI data; additional practical notes as summarized on in ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128204801001881 or https://layerfmri.com/layerification/ (see sections on limits and beyond equi-volume) or here: https://layerfmri.com/equivol/). Touching upon these open issues would help clarify the current boundaries of the methodology without detracting from its utility. The paper’s emphasis on integrating cellular information with myeloarchitecture is compelling and forward-looking. One area that might further enrich the perspective is the recent progress in laminar angioarchitecture mapping. Incorporating vascular organization into the discussion could complement the covariance-based framework and provide a more holistic view of microstructural constraints on functional signals. Similarly, there is an opportunity to draw on emerging insights from laminar connectivity research. Several recent studies have shown how layer-dependent interactions can deepen our understanding of cortical organization and dynamics (e.g., Finn et al., 2021; Koiso et al., 2023; Huber et al., 2021). Highlighting the potential synergy between laminar connectivity and the authors’ gradient-based framework could further broaden the conceptual horizon of the perspective. Overall, this perspective is a well-written and valuable contribution that synthesizes an influential research direction and points to promising future avenues. With minor additions acknowledging methodological limits and incorporating insights from related subfields, the paper would offer an even more comprehensive and impactful guidepost for the community.",2025-11-20T17:00:09,renzohuber,Renzo Huber,,,,

Here are our highlights: This work demonstrates that metagenomes contains a vast layer of “not yet genome-resolved” biodiversity. According to the results, up to ~80% of putative species-level clusters are not represented by genomes of cultivated organisms or by MAGs. The study quantitatively shows that species discovery is far from saturation and strongly habitat-dependent. Human gut samples and anthropogenic environments are already densely sampled and contribute few new lineages per additional metagenome, whereas soils, aquatic ecosystems, the rhizosphere, and non-mammalian hosts remain true hotspots of unexplored diversity. A separate and fundamentally important result - confirmed numerically- is the observation that the structure of prokaryotic diversity follows the same universal statistical laws (the power-law Willis-Yule / Yule-Simon distributions) as that of eukaryotes. In other words, the authors demonstrate that the same simple macroevolutionary regularities operate across the entire Tree of Life.",2025-11-20T15:34:33,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

A true mutualistic interaction is one in which both partners benefit from the interaction. While there may be some cheating involved, the basis of the relationship must be mutually beneficial to both organisms involved. In the case of pitcher plants and insects, there can only be a single benefactor to any interaction. If the plant benefits from consuming an insect, the insect does not benefit. If the insect benefits from consuming pitcher extrafloral nectar, then that insect must not fall into the plant's trap and thus the plant does not benefit. There cannot be a true mutualism here. For the same reason, the sentiment of a ""reciprocal nutrient exchange between carnivorous plants and local insect populations"" (line 235) is misleading, as the insects which obtain nutrients from the carnivorous plants in question are, by necessity, not the same insects which provide nutrients to the carnivorous plants. The most appropriate framing device for this paper in my opinion would be to simply focus on whether any insects are able to obtain a significant portion of their nutritional requirements from carnivorous plants, which would make Darlingtonia not a strict predator; instead, it would occupy a less straightforward place in the trophic web of the serpentine fen. The manuscript does mention this concept several times, but never as the driving concept or overall thrust of the paper. I think reframing the paper, including the title, around questioning whether carnivorous plants are always strict predators of insects would improve the manuscript. To further the potential novelty of this paper, reframing could focus on the fact that it is already known that specialist insects benefit from interactions with pitcher plants (often in an actually mutually beneficial manner, sensu detritivorous pitcher plant inquilines) but far less is known about whether any generalist insects may benefit from interactions with the plants. Darlingtonia 's focal status in this study is more or less self-explanatory, but the use of Vespula specifically is far less so. At no point in the introduction are yellowjackets  set up to be a good candidate for the study at hand, nor do the methods explain why Vespula was chosen. It is my belief that the use of Vespula wasps is a strength of this study's design, and the manuscript should make that clear. There are several reasons why Vespula is an ideal choice here. For example, it is stated that wasps rarely fall prey to pitchers despite visiting them regularly, thus they are good candidate insects for an investigation of nitrogen isotopes which originate from pitcher nectar. Studies which investigate compounds that are found in higher concentrations at higher trophic levels (i.e., are biomagnified) might benefit from first looking at the highest trophic levels; if no signature is detected at the greatest point of biomagnification, then it is likely that lower trophic levels will likewise show no difference in bioaccumulated material. Vespula wasps occupy a high trophic level in this ecosystem, making them a good candidate for this study in this aspect as well. Yellowjackets are also easy to selectively capture in great numbers due to the availability of specialized traps, meaning there are cheap, effective, passive methods for sampling a large number of them. This paper does address that these wasps forage in localized patches, and thus can be more reliably assigned to either ""fen"" or ""forest"" patches, but this is brought up in passing. Any number of these points can and should be addressed, as it stands there is no explicit justification given for using these wasps as opposed to any other group of insects.",2025-11-20T03:10:28,osedaxMucofloris,osedaxMucofloris,,,,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.18.689145v1#comment-6798844946,biorxivstage,3,"This preprint already received a “major revision” decision. Unfortunately, the original reviewers were not available to evaluate it again, and the process stalled. Despite sending 15 additional peer-review invitations, no one agreed to take it on. Although the manuscript has now entered a new review process, I am attaching the previous reviewers’ comments. ------------------------- Reviewer 1 This isn’t a finding as not only is it already available information, the use of the available IUCN maps and statuses was part of the methodology. R/ We rephrased the sentence to clarify that it refers to the underlying data itself and not to our results. I like the approach they’ve taken, but none of this is novel information or unexpected. R/ Although it is well known that mountains promote diversity and endemism at a global macroevolutionary scale, this information has not been explicitly tested in Colombian squamates in conjunction with threat categories. We consider that clearly stating the result of hotspots of diversity and endemism in Colombian squamates can help local environmental policies. Therefore, while our results are consistent with theoretical expectations, this alignment does not diminish the novelty of our findings, as we provide the first quantitative analysis supporting these patterns in the local context. This is the main novel finding of the work and I’d recommend reorganising the text to stress this. R/ We modified several sections of the text to emphasize the finding highlighted by the reviewer, also in accordance with comments made by the other reviewer. Unclear what this means in the context of this paper. R/ We rephrased the section for clarity. This is just the existing EDGE list, so I’m not sure it warrants mentioning as an output here. R/ In accordance with a comment from Reviewer 2, we acknowledge that this is a local rather than a global list, and that species rankings may differ between the two. Therefore, we believe it is an output worth highlighting. Nevertheless, we have clarified in the text the differences between the local and global scores and their implications. This entire paragraph seems superfluous, and this work has nothing to do with the latitudinal gradient so it’s a strange thing to focus discussion on. R/ While we briefly mention the latitudinal gradient, the main purpose of this introductory paragraph is to provide general context on biodiversity, leading into the key argument of the subsequent sections: the need to understand biodiversity and extinction risk as multidimensional phenomena. We have made minor adjustments to better integrate the role of the latitudinal gradient in promoting tropical diversity, thereby reinforcing the importance of prioritizing conservation efforts in regions of exceptionally high biodiversity. Suggested added context as this was unclear as worded. R/ We accepted the reviewer’s suggestion and revised the text accordingly. I’m not sure this follows - more that, as the paragraph goes onto say, it results in a lack of understanding of the impacts and vulnerability of the species. R/ We rephrased the idea to make it clearer. This seems to be an inappropriate reference, as Paez et al. 2006 focused on turtles rather than squamates. Please check and reword as needed. R/ We double-checked the reference and confirmed that it is correct, as it covers not only turtles but all Colombian reptiles (including squamates, crocodiles, and turtles). This seems inconsistent with the earlier statement that “a local assessment is lacking” - should this rather say a recent local assessment? Though as the paper goes on to reference a 2015 ‘local assessment’, it’s unclear what this section means. R/ We agree with the reviewer and revised the text to clarify that we refer to a recent assessment that also considers different facets of biodiversity, not just species richness (i.e., taxonomic diversity). The figure given later is 597, and that was used as the basis for the analysis. This may be a discrepancy due to a later update, but the same Reptile Database update should be cited throughout the paper for consistency. R/ In the Introduction, we refer to the most recent estimate of 620 reptile species for Colombia, based on the latest update of the Reptile Database (2024). However, the analyses in this study were based on the 2023 version of the database, which listed 597 species at that time. Given that the analyses were conducted using the 2023 data, and a complete reanalysis would be required to incorporate the updated figures, we chose to retain the original dataset to ensure consistency and reproducibility. We have clarified this point in the text to avoid confusion. Better to use the term ‘squamates’ rather than ‘reptiles’ if crocs and turtles are to be excluded. R/ Done, we have consistently replaced ""reptiles"" with ""squamates"" throughout the text where appropriate. Once again, this could benefit from clarity. The data in the Reptile Database should be reviewed with reference to available material and literature to be used as a formal checklist, but it should be ‘complete’ - it’s more likely to erroneously list species from a country than to miss ones that actually occur there. R/ We agree with the reviewer and rephrased the sentence to make the idea clearer. Are the authors able to explain the discrepancy between this figure and the maps (which represented 81% of the dataset)? Most IUCN assessments will have maps, but no IUCN maps will be associated with species that don’t have assessments. R/ The figures were validated against the information provided in Table S1. As the reviewer correctly points out, there are more assessments than polygons, consistent with the supplementary material. The figure of 77% corresponds to 461 species (excluding DD and NE categories) out of 597 species in our dataset (461/597 = 0.77). Meanwhile, the figure of 81% refers to 481 species with available geographic information, including species categorized as DD (481/597 = 0.81). The discrepancy arises because DD species were included when considering geographic data but excluded from threat category analyses. We have revised the Methods and Results sections to clarify this distinction explicitly. Also, we updated the previous 77% figure to include DD species too, increasing it to 92%. This is not a sufficient way to evaluate whether the assessments are likely to need updating - the Criteria take account of the distribution and extent of threats to each species, not simply its distribution. The ‘needs update’ tag is applied by the Red List only to assessments more than 10 years old, which is all that should be mentioned here. R/ We understand the reviewer’s concern and acknowledge that a mismatch between EOO and threat classification is not sufficient by itself to determine if an update is needed. We have separated these ideas in the text: first, we highlight species whose assessments are formally tagged as “needs update” after 10 years; second, we discuss species whose EOO does not align with their current threat classification. We moved the second point to the 3.2 Geographic patterns section, and expanded the Discussion to better explain these observations. See above. The authors didn’t ‘show’ this, they interpreted the Criteria incorrectly. R/ See previous answer. We further expanded the Discussion section to better frame this point. I would consider it suitable for the manuscript to be more fully revised as a shorter paper, as the region-scale analysis within Colombia and the phylogenetic results are of more interest than the well-trodden path of identifying the Andes as an area of greater endemism than Amazonia and the additional analyses included in the paper render its main findings somewhat opaque in places. R/ We consider that highlighting the Andes as an area of high endemism is necessary to provide context for interpreting the patterns of phylogenetic diversity. While it may be a well-known topic, not all readers will have the same background. Although the manuscript is extensive because it covers taxonomic, geographic, and phylogenetic patterns, its current length (ca. 6,300 words, excluding references) is well within the 9,000-word limit for Original Research articles in Biodiversity and Conservation and only slightly above the typical 5,000-word range. Nevertheless, we made an effort to shorten unnecessary sections to improve focus and clarity. For example, we removed some analysis related to diversification rates and extinction risk, since as the Reviewer 2 pointed out, some metrics depending on branch lengths may be biased. Reviewer 2 L393-405: it is important to acknowledge the phylogenetic incompleteness of a national-level analysis, and how that might be affecting these results – divergence times are influenced by phylogenetic coverage and structure, removing >90% of squamate species from the phylogeny will give you divergence times between Colombian species, not true lineage age/divergence time information. This could be addressed with sensitivity analyses to explore how lineage age varies between pruned and complete trees, or with stronger discussion of the pitfalls of this approach in the methods and discussion, with clearer wording in the results. R/ We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment and fully agree. We performed additional calculations to assess sensitivity, and indeed, the age of some lineages can be severely affected, while others remain largely unchanged. Following the reviewer’s recommendation, we revised the Methods and Discussion sections to place greater emphasis on the limitations of using evolutionary metrics derived from pruned trees and on the considerations needed when interpreting these results. As the reviewer also notes, these results are not necessarily incorrect, since global conservation priorities do not always align with local ones. Additionally, we introduced local and global subscripts to our metrics to explicitly distinguish between them. 407-418: Distinction is needed between EDGE scores and national EDGE scores (literally just saying ‘national EDGE scores’ would suffice). It may also be useful to identify national-specific priorities – i.e. high ranking national EDGE species that are not highly ranked in global context. There are EDGE scores available for all vertebrates at the global level here ( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45119-z) . There are endemic Colombian squamates that are high EDGE in this study and also high EDGE at the global scale (e.g. Lepidoblepharis miyatai) but also species that are high EDGE nationally because of the phylogenetic diversity they are solely responsible for in Colombia, but the responsibility for which is shared beyond Colombia’s borders. These key cases can be instrumental in ensuring species that are globally ‘safe’ but locally important do not fall through the cracks. R/ Please refer to the previous response. We now explicitly distinguish between national EDGE scores and global EDGE scores throughout the text and highlight cases where species are locally important but not necessarily globally prioritized. L41 and throughout: “threatenedness” = “extinction risk” or “level of threat”. R/ Done. Throughout: It’s the IUCN Red List, not IUCN, particularly when referring to versions of the Red List database. R/ Done. L145: make it clear you’re referring to national endemics. R/ The Resolución 0126/2024 from Colombia’s Ministry of Environment (MADS) covers not only national endemics but all species occurring within the country’s administrative boundaries. L167: ensure it’s clear that its imputation based on taxonomy alone. R/ Done. L182: check references. R/ We reviewed the references cited at this point and confirm they are correct. L222-224 and throughout: phylogenetic diversity == Faith’s PD – the other measures are indices of phylogenetic distance/relatedness that are calculated in same units as PD, but are not phylogenetic diversity – that should be clarified. R/ Done. We clarified that Faith’s PD refers specifically to phylogenetic diversity, while the other metrics represent measures of phylogenetic relatedness or distance. L393: extinction risk should not be though of as a trait evolving but as the manifestation of extrinsic and intrinsic factors. R/ Agreed. We rewrote the sentence. L393-397: unclear what the relationships discussed are, and what they infer. R/ We have removed this section from both the Methods and Results. Given that the correlations discussed involved metrics dependent on branch length — and, as the reviewer previously pointed out, branch lengths can be affected by pruning the phylogenetic trees — we decided to eliminate this section. Overall, it did not substantially contribute to the text or to the discussion. L428-429: This is higher than, or at least comparable to, the global % of DD/NE squamates I think, so might not be considered relatively low for squamates. R/ We rewrote the sentence to clarify that it is comparable to or higher than the global percentage, as the reviewer correctly pointed out. L429-432: it might be worth highlighting how taxonomists and others can contribute to rapid reassessment of species with basic information in ecological publications see: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.01.022 R/ Done. We incorporated the reviewer’s suggestion. L442-444: Unclear what is meant here? A species can be assessed as CR with a wide range if its under population decline criteria, and a small-ranged species can be assessed as not-threatened if there is no evidence of decline/ongoing degradation. R/ This comment was also raised by Reviewer 1. We addressed it accordingly by revising the text to clarify that species can indeed have wide distributions and still qualify as Critically Endangered if facing significant threats, and vice versa. Please refer to our responses to Reviewer 1.",2025-11-19T21:19:50,,Daniel Vásquez-Restrepo,,,,

It seems a very antiquated model in terms of dealing with that many data points. The reality is we don't know much about living biological organisms that can potentially process that amount of data, human beings probably can't, let alone deal with anything moving faster than tradition UV wavelengths of light (with frequencies of about 400 nanometers). X-Rays obviously move faster than our ability to see them but that does not necessarily mean in curved space time, that theoretically an electron can't move faster than an X-Ray. Is it possible that Cesium Iodide, has the exact magnetic resonant frequency as x-rays, possibly. The fundamental problem seems to be understanding nature as it relates to cyber security. A whale and most marine life, are capable of generating a variety of different magnetic resonant frequencies to communicate as well as being able to swarm / flock around a central point in 3-dimensional space. Seems to me the central rotational point of a swarm / flock whether, birds, bees or fish as defined by AI swarm mathematics, such that the central node, is moved in virtual curved space dimensions of n where Riemannian manifold geometry no longer apply (say on a forwarded edge cache header of a content delivery network) this could be moved through this space at theoretically faster than x-ray speeds where c tends towards infinity. Ie move the theoretical swarm response center faster than light. This must be where modern cybersecurity must invariably end up such that AI ends up controlling the response to 1.8million malicious data points, or: conversely; 1.8million requests of benign agents, in terms of bandwidth limiting / load shedding. The notion of adversarial AI in either context largely becomes irrelevant. It will simply lie to protect itself and humanity at the same time. Any perceived threat against any aspect of humanity itself while it processes a faster response and solution to the entire 1.8 million data points of malicious attempts at denial of service, than could ever be neutralized in under 7 seconds It becomes naturally obvious that it is working in humanities interest and always will. As to the connection to whale brain functions and mice. I think it might be interesting to pose a question to the marine biologists of this world about their view regarding whale brains and how they generate sound, and magnetic resonant frequencies beyond the speed of sound, and potentially x-rays and yet they remain an endangered species?",2025-11-17T13:48:16,robertsonandy,"Robertson, Andy",,,,

Neutrophils are the most abundant immune cells in the body, outnumbering all other immune cells combined, so any analysis of tissue needs to identify them or explain why they are absent. It has already been demonstrated using single cell transcriptomics that neutrophils are not functioning properly in preeclampsia: Xiao S, Ding Y, Yu L, Deng Y, Zhou Y, Peng M, Lai W, Nie Y, Zhang W. Maternal-Fetal Interface Cell Dysfunction in Patients With Preeclampsia Revealed via Single-Cell RNA Sequencing. Am J Reprod Immunol. 2025 Sep;94(3):e70101. doi: 10.1111/aji.70101. PMID: 40924867. In pregnancy, the neutrophil fraction increases to 70% of all white blood cells (two neutrophils for every one other type). They are involved in all activities of the uterus including the build-up of the endometrium, spiral artery formation, the break down and expulsion of the endometrium, placental vascularization, cervical remodelling to enable the passage of the newborn, the expulsion of the placenta, the coagulation and diversion of the uterine arteries and the remodelling of the uterus back to its pre-pregnancy size and shape. I would go as far as to say that from an evolutionary point of view, the whole reason that primates have and make so many neutrophils is to support reproduction. The main issues with this work follow: 1.	PBMC should not be used as a control for immune cells in single cell transcriptomics of tissue as mononuclear cells do not represent the full identity or functionality of immune cells. 2.	In figure 1f, it should be possible to identify all of the clusters on the UMAP more precisely. For example, there are 2 clusters of “myeloid cells”. What are they? I don’t believe that they are both monocytes/macrophages. Monocytes and macrophages differ by only a small number of transcripts. The most widely accepted distinguishing surface protein is CD68. Why is this not used? 3.	Why is the UMAP for a preeclampsia sample not shown? 4.	CD16 should not be used to identify NK cells or CD16+ monocytes without additional markers. All neutrophils express CD16. 5.	Neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages are phagocytic and phagocytosis is key to their function. If a maternal phagocyte phagocytoses a fetal cell, the phagocyte will then contain both genotypes. Could this explain some of the observations in Figure 1? I hope that a more enlightened version of this manuscript – one that considers rolls of immune cells in placental development and function more broadly – will be published.

We have advised him, and we have significantly challenged him. He has diligently sought every possible way in which he might be wrong - he is his own most significant challenger. No one would be more pleased to see a solid data-driven disproof of any of his conclusions than he would. The fundamental difference in his bottom-up, data-driven no-hypothesis exploration of mitochondrial DNA versus prior analyses (such as in population genetics and genetic genealogy) is that those have been primarily based on point comparisons of mutations and indels. His consideration is based on the biology of the 3D structure of the mtDNA, specifically in how the palindromes that make up so much of the mtDNA shape that structure and thus the function of the mtDNA. All point mutations are not the same: for example, a point mutation in a palindrome can have either a non-viable result or else result in a mitochondrial DNA disease. He has sought and believes he has provided an objective reproducible method to explore mitochondrial DNA without preconceptions. If his method is valid, this alone is a major contribution, independent of what he has found about mtDNA. What the data has revealed and the conclusions he has made from the data very definitely challenge major beliefs about mtDNA. In genetic genealogy discussions I have seen, the reaction is defense of the status quo, with no real examination of the data discoveries underlying Dr. Stumpf's conclusions. This is not surprising but also not of any real help in verifying or refuting his conclusions. I hope that serious examination of his methods and data and analytical results and whether or not they support his conclusions will be presented here.",2025-11-14T16:06:36,disqus_qnONUSxcx5,Wesley Johnston,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.28.656644v1#comment-6796501259,biorxivstage,2,"Dear authors, as a part of a group activity aimed to improved our skills and growth as scientists, we discussed recent BioRxiv preprints that we found to be of particular interest. This time, our choice fell on your manuscript: - Gamarra M. et al., Vesicular Rps6 released by astrocytes regulate local translation and enhance synaptic markers in neurons. The comments below are the results of this exercise and reflects thoughts and comments of several people. We hope our exercise may help you to finalize your efforts and publish your manuscript in a good journal. Comments The manuscript by Gamarra et al. investigates the regulation of local translation in axons and the role that astroglia plays in it. The authors described, for the first time, a novel mechanism of intracellular communication in the central nervous system (CNS) based on the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are released from astrocytes and contain the ribosomal protein S6 (Rps6). The authors showed that these astrocyte-derived vesicular Rps6 are taken up by axons and are able to enhance synaptic markers and to fine-tune neuronal function. This work suggests that astrocyte EVs can actively influence neuronal local protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity through the transfer of specific non-neuronal ribosomal proteins, highlighting a novel mechanism for intercellular communication in the brain and opening new routes for therapeutic strategies based on EVs potential. Major comments 1.	Figure2 - Bi and 2Bii The heatmap in Figure 2Bi shows an increase the levels of both Rpl26 and Rps6 that is rather due to the introduction of astrocyte in the co-culture (NA condition) of both DMSO and Aβ1-42-treated samples. The box and whisker graphs in Figure 2Bii report the normalized levels of Rpl26 and Rps6 from the same experiments (analyzed by proteomics from 4 independent cultures). The normalized level of Rpl26 in Figure 2Bii matches the increment in Rpl26 level displayed in the heatmap in Figure 2Bi while the normalized level of Rps6 shows a discrepancy in DMSO NA conditions. It will be helpful to clarify and provide further justification of these representations in particular since, in the text, the author stated that - Conversely, Rps6, a component of the S40 subunit was upregulated only in Aβ-treated co-cultures and not in basal conditions (Figure 2Bii, right graph). This statement doesn’t match what is depicted in Figure 2Bii, right graph). We agreed that the difference is not significant but there is definitely a trend toward an upregulation of Rps6 levels also in the DMSO NA. 2.	Figure 4 – A The authors analyzed puromycin labelling in axon as a readout for local translation upon incubation with EVs released from DMSO and Aβ-treated astrocytes. The latter treatment, as shown in Figure 3 – C, increases the number of EVs released by astrocytes. We agreed that might be helpful to clarify whether the number of EVs were normalized or not. We believe it is key to the paper message to clarify whether the effects of astrocytes EVs on axonal local translation is due to EVs content rather than too their numbers. 3.	Figure 5 - Biii These conditions seem to give a lot of variability, with 2 out of 3 experiments showing a similar trend as is observed for Aβ-EVs in Figure 5 – Ciii. We thought that, in order to better convince the audience and prove your point of the absence of any effect in axonal translation upon incubation with EVs generated from DMSO treated astrocytes, it may be worth to perform a 4th replicate. 4.	Figure 5 – D and E and Figure 7 - C It will be of help to clarify why the author chose to quantify the number of synaptophysin (Syn) and Homer puncta. Are Syn and Homer known to be regulated by local protein translation? The authors claimed an axonal effect of EVs derived from Aβ-treated astrocytes. Why is a post-synaptic marker included? In case Homer staining was included to be sure to look at synapses, why do the authors not quantify Syn only from synaptophysin and Homer positive puncta? Minor comments •	A brief explanation on how well established the use of modified Boyden chamber is needed, especially in regard to possible direct contact between neurons and astrocytes due to the length of axons. •	The authors should consider using a single nomenclature throughout the manuscript for better clarity and readability.  For example, in Figures 1 and 2 a different notation is used for neuron monoculture (1 and N) and neuron-astrocyte co-cultures (2 and NA). •	Figure 1 - Bii - O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) is a tRNA analog that is incorporated in all newly synthesized proteins without a defined kinetics or a precise position in the aminoacidic sequence. From the immunoblot showed in Figure 1 – Bii, we would expect a smear in the lane cause newly synthesized protein should come in all different kDa. The same reasoning can be applied to the Amido Black staining. Why is it not the case? •	Figure 1 - Biii – The data suggests that OPP-biotin conjugates can be consistently and unambiguously detected in neurites isolated from neuron-astrocyte co-cultures independently from their exposure to Aβ treatment. OPP-biotin signal looks comparable in both DMSO and Aβ treated co-culture. •	Figure 1 – Ci – Out of curiosity, which is the common CC cluster found in both soma and neurite compartment?",2025-11-14T14:02:59,,Anonymous,,,,

This would greatly help readers understand how the sites were selected and how spatial structure may influence the results. From the current description, it appears possible that treatment plots are located inside outbreak areas while control plots are situated outside of them. If this is the case, the design may risk pseudoreplication, as outbreak and non-outbreak areas can systematically differ in environmental conditions independent of the treatment. Clarifying this aspect, and discussing how such spatial structure was accounted for in the analysis, would strengthen the robustness of the study.

Here are our highlights: Inefficient intron splicing is repurposed as a regulatory mechanism. What might seem like a limitation, instead becomes something functional, an idea that might apply to a diversity of signaling pathways with a prominent rate limiting step. Identifying other genes with similar ""IntP-like"" introns shows that the tim mechanism likely isn't a one-off, but part of a post-transcriptional regulatory strategy that could apply to development and stress response as well. Classic models of circadian regulation focus heavily on proteins and transcriptional feedback. This paper argues that RNA processing can be an intrinsic timing mechanism, revealing a new method for clock control.
