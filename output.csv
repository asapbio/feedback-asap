I am very happy that you enjoyed the preprint. As you suggested, I can provide some contextual information that will help on the understanding of the pointed issues. You indicate that our mention of AAP “phenology in freshwater lakes remains unknown” is inaccurate and there are already “few studies”. However, there is, up to our knowledge, no research that has been tracking the interannual variations and the recurrence (Phenology) of the AAP community in fresh waters. Here, we do not write that it is the first seasonal study of AAP in lakes, but the first study that focuses on the phenology of AAP community (three years in freshwater lake). In case you are aware of some studies that focus on AAP bacteria in freshwater lakes during several years, we would be very pleased. Regarding to the fluctuation of AAP abundance, you indicated that “it is unclear where this assertion comes from”, however, as described in materials and methods, AAP abundance was assessed using IR-microscopy. Since the paper is not based on manipulative experiments but observational samplings, no biological replicates were available and the AAP counts per sample (as described in M&M) can be found in Supplementary File S5. We agree that not statistical trends or deviations can be obtained from the graphical representation in Supplementary Figure S5, nevertheless, we tried to uncover relevant trends and show them also in the Supplementary Figure S7 and Supplementary File S6. AAP and bacterial numbers were calculated, as it is stated in M&M, using epifluorescence microscopy method as described in Piwosz et al., 2022 [17]. As you point out it is correct that lakes that are stratified might become anoxic in hypolimnion. However, despite the fact that there is a reduction of oxygen in the hypolimnion during summer, this is not the case for the illuminated to the bottom CEP lake (Supplementary File S5) which always presented an oxic environment. Additionally, this trend (oxic hypolimnion even during stratification) has been observed before in this same lake (Villena-Alemany et al., 2023. Diversity dynamics of Aerobic Anoxygenic Phototrophic Bacteria). Therefore, since CEP lake represents a fully oxic environment, the occurrence of anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs is negligible. Additionally, it is very well known that in anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs the expression of photosynthetic apparatus is repressed by oxygen. This indicates that the BChl-a signals that we observe from the fully oxic environment originates from AAP bacteria. Not only this but, in Kolesár Fecskeová et al., 2019 the expression of AAP phototrophic genes in this same lake was already proven. Regarding the “phototrophic Myxococcota”, in the reference 100, in the Supplementary Data of that paper are stated the environments from where the MAGs were reconstructed. There, it is indicated that several Myxococcota MAGs were repeatedly reported from oxic environments. We can agree that further researches need to be done to unveil the functionality of this recently discovered phototrophic group, and by writing about “potential significance in microbial communities” of Myxococcota we meant that there is the possibility they have an important role since they were recurrently detected during 3 years. As they are newly recognized phototrophic group, member of AAP bacteria, there is more research needed, but we can observe that they can be found recurrently in freshwater lakes. Furthermore, the AAP percent contribution is not related with the pufM gene database. It is calculated as the percentage of total bacteria that are AAPs. As described in Piwosz et al., 2022, all bacteria are counted using DAPI and AAP bacteria according to BChl-a fluorescence. We are really grateful that you liked the database and we believe and hope that it will be an excellent tool for people studying anoxygenic photosynthesis. Yes, the MAGs had a great contribution in our database, and we included as much pufM gene sequences as we could to improve the taxonomic assignment pufM gene amplicons. Naturally, it also encompasses pufM gene of anaerobic anoxygenic bacteria  and could also be used in anaerobic environments. Nevertheless, the category of AAP bacteria is a functional metabolic attribute, given to anoxygenic phototrophs in oxic environments, and the inclusion of anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophic MAGs into the database does not hamper the taxonomic assignation of AAP bacteria. I hope you find all the answers to the questions you stated here. I am really happy that you like the paper and to have this discussion. Looking forward if you have further contributions or thoughts.

Just by analogy of distances this is not enough. A physics-driven method would also provide some form of binding energy. Since the output here is simply a distance matrix I don't think it's fair to call this a physics driven method. The model also lacks a way to indicate confidence or ""binding energy"" if you will. What happens if I run the prediction on a pocket that does not contain a metal site? The model would still place the ion somewhere, no? Authors should explain how DisDock has the potential to accommodate the flexibility of both ligands and proteins. In l.47 or l76 authors state that rigid protein structures are used. Table 1 is confusing. Are the percentiles referring to mean distance between predicted and experimental position? This is only mentioned in the text but not in the caption Is 25% the best predictions or the worst ones? This is not clear. The authors also justify that they do not compare against Metal3D because it only was trained on zinc, yet they compare the predictor by Wang et.al trained only on copper with their method. For Metal3D it was also shown that it performs well for 10 of the 16 metals in the training set for DisDock even if it was trained only on zinc. The authors should also provide a segmented analysis of the performance of their method for the different metal ions in the dataset in the main text of the paper.  I don't think it makes sense to train the method on 5 CD sites and have actually 0 examples in the test set. In this case this metal should be excluded from training at all. For inference there seems to be a bit of divergence of where the actual metal is placed depending on the input search region. The authors should quantify this and provide a recommendation how many runs should be run starting from different location based on this analysis. Otherwise they cannot claim as in l.201 that the performance is consistent irrespective of the chosen initial location. In Figure S1 they just analyse the dependence on the starting distance. But there might also be an influence which equidistant starting point is used. For BioMetAll the authors should clearly detail in the methods section with what parameters the results have been computed and what is used as reference (any probe or just the cluster centers). It is also not correct that Metal3D takes the entire protein as input. Metal3D operates on residue centered voxel grids, that can be aggregated to compute a prediction for the whole protein but it is also possible to compute the binding probability around a specific residue. The authors should also clarify about code/data availability. Disclaimer: I am one of the authors of Metal3D (Simon Duerr).

In addition, sentences like “Our results challenge the prevailing paradigm that NLR proteins exclusively signal via their N-terminal domains and reveal a signaling activity for the NB domain of NRC-dependent sensor NLRs.” make me feel like the novelty is “hyped”. The signaling activity of the NB domain presented here is passive, similar to a guardee. The guard model is not novel. This gives a bad impression on an overall good study. The study should be complemented. 1 Most importantly, interaction data between RxNB (and other NBs) and NRCs should be provided. 2 The quality of blots in fig 2 should be enhanced. 3 I think the lettuce experiments should be complemented with Q-PCRs to show that defense genes can be upregulated by Rx/NRCs. This should be required before suggesting the use of sensor/helper pair for crop improvement. Here are a few comments: I find it disturbing that the introduction mostly cites previous papers from the Kamoun lab. I think the use of Rx halves expressed in trans does not bring much to the study and to the understanding of Rx function. Rx full length triggers the same phenotype so why bother using halves? In addition, these halves do not behave like full length Rx in term of oligomerization thus they seem biologically irrelevant. Figure 1B. Red circle, why not Rx full length in red too? Caption: “Experiments were repeated 3 times with similar results” Did you perform 4 replicates of each experiment? Repeat once = done twice. Figure 2 V5 panel is not great. I only see a smear on the whole gel. What is signal, what is noise in this gel? I don’t think we can conclude anything from this. Plus, why should we care about what this chimeric truncation of a protein does? Figure 3D: Why use time point? There is no difference between 3/4/5dpi. Most importantly, where are eGFP and CP-GFP? Figure 4 is nice; I like this part. I would like to have the WB data in the main figure, it would be easier to read (to understand that accumulation is correlated to activity). However, this part could really benefit from protein interaction data. Figure 5: The chlorosis symptoms on the adaxial part of the leaves are not clear. You should remove this and keep only the abaxial pictures to avoid misleading the readers. Figure 6: This schematic is not great. Is the p-loop required for Rx activation or for NRC activation? Is it even a 2step process? Isn’t it just that CP activates NRCs by changing Rx conformation? Also, what do we know about Rx halves interacting together? The structure of the NRC resistosome is unknown, membrane insertion is unknown but here these are presented as facts. I hope this helps.

Unfortunately, I'm disappointed and even irritated. Berryhill et al. ignore (may be deliberately since the key info and refs present in the source which they do cite)  almost the whole body of knowledge about the O antigen-mediated shielding of E. coli the bulk of which (over the last 20 years) has been created by my lab with several important contributions form other teams, e.g. Martin Loessner's group (PMID 34784345). Among our papers this one  and the refs therein covers the essence of the question (PMID: 30814597). The systemic analysis of the current state-of-the-art in this field can be found in my review which I hope to see published shortly and now it is posted as a preprint ( https://www.preprints.org/m.... The phenomenon of narrow spectra of sensitivity of gut E. coli isolates to co-existing phages was also discovered by us (PMID: 17704275) and later studied in-depth and linked to the O-antigen mediated anti-phage protection (multiple papers are easy to find using my name as the keyword). The essential thing is that despite highly effective non-specific protection from of phage infection provided by E. coli O antigen, many phages have various mechanisms to penetrate the barrier. So the fact of this protection does not preclude phage infection in the community. The fact that humans seldom excrete virulent coliphages is long known (see our old review PMID: 19239553), and most probably is due to environmental constraints. The gut coliphage ecology is different in some other species such as  horses or pigs despite the omnipresent O antigens. The isolation of the phages by enrichment on a rough (lacking the O antigen) lab strain pre-programs the poor infectivity against most co-existing O antigen-proteceted isolates. By itself this result means nothing.

While we appreciate your feedback, we would like address here the points you raised. First, regarding the role of asymmetric tension. We appreciate that your J Phys Chem B (2022) paper tackles the role of membrane asymmetry in defining the budding direction. However, the role of asymmetric tension was reported first, to the best of our knowledge, by Thiam (DOI: 10.1016/j.bpj.2017.12.014), and then, in simulations, in our paper titled ""Membrane Asymmetry Imposes Directionality on Lipid Droplet Emergence from the ER"", published in Dev. Cell in 2019 (DOI: 10.1016/j.devcel.2019.05.003). Second, on maturation and budding. We read carefully your very interesting eLife paper, and we appreciate your contribution to understanding the role of seipin in scaffolding the neck of the nascent lipid droplet - as stated in our manuscript. However, lipid droplet maturation and budding are dynamic, non-equilibrium processes, in which the droplet grows and changes shape in time. We simulated growth and budding as dynamic processes, performing non-equilibrium simulations with non-constant number of particles, emulating lipid synthesis. The simulations in your paper (and all other simulations of lipid droplets in the literature, to the best of our knowledge) are equilibrium simulations, with a fixed number of lipids; they address equilibrium properties of *already budded* shapes, similar to experimental papers showing  *already budded* lipid droplets. Our work, instead, addresses the mechanism of budding as a dynamic process. Being dynamic processes, we maintain that growth and budding were never simulated before (nor observed experimentally, due to the insufficient time resolution of current experimental methods).

It could be argued that there is still more to learn, each lake may have AAP populations fluctuating differently based on particular factors, and they can be monitored differently, but there have been previous studies nonetheless. Perhaps a small rewording will suffice, maybe suggesting your first integration of AAP into a PEG model, rather than first seasonal study of AAP in lakes. The paper suggests that AAP fluctuate by season, with a spring maximum and then a resurgence in the fall, but it is unclear where this assertion comes from. First, there are no numbers or variance provided, except for a singular maximum of 3.42 - 5.50 × 105 cells/ mL. How much did they vary per replicate vs per season or per year? Did they reach the same maximum each year or were less found for one particular season? Fig S5 is only a heat-map of data, and while the colours are nice, it is unclear if different years had similar trends/ deviation. It would appear that 2017 had an outright absence of enumerated AAP vs 2018 or 2019, and this discrepancy may hinder correlative analysis. In addition, it is not clear how the AAP numbers were calculated, was it from the BChl a autofluorescence microscopy counts? In the manuscript there is mention of the lake becoming stratified, which leads me to conclude that there is a strong possibility for anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs to be present. As lakes have a fall turn-over (mixing), couldn’t the fall resurgence of detected BChl a autofluorescence not be of “AAP”, but instead be a mix (or predominantly) be made up of anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs? What evidence is provided that your measurements aren’t of both aerobic and anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs containing BChl a? Similar reasoning additionally questions if “phototrophic Myxococcota” are aerobic or anaerobic. The reference #100 shows that Myxococcota puf genes could be transferred into the anaerobic Rba. sphaeroides, which suggests it may be a (facultative?) anaerobe, not necessarily an aerobic phototroph. In addition, those authors suggested these Myxococcota have CO2 fixation – another indication of being anaerobic. Also, your nice story ends with a suggestion that while the Myxococotta “contribution was low”, that they are “potentially significant”. In what way are they significant? Perhaps showing some numbers into their contribution, or expanding upon this may support the implied significance. The puf database appears to be a really good asset. However, it is unclear how the AAP percent contribution of the bacterial community Fig S5E was calculated. While the puf database was used for looking into the variability of AAP populations within the community of anoxygenic phototrophs, there is no mention of how you chose AAP of the total community of bacteria that do not have pufM. Presumably you used the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes, but no list of AAP genera chosen for this analysis is provided or cited. Furthermore, while your puf database is indeed impressive, it is stated in-text to be composed of not just type material, but also MAGs (of high quality). While useful to show off diversity of sequences, MAGs do not provide concrete evidence of the respiration statues of any bacterium, particularly if the MAG is divergent from known AAP. Taken together, because your study followed the genes/ autofluorescence of not just AAP, but potentially of all anoxygenic phototrophs, I suggest providing content explaining how you sorted each group separately. If the levels of BChl a containing bacteria are detected by autofluorescence alone, then it is tracing all anoxygenic phototrophic populations, not solely aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs. If your pufM genes are closely related to MAGs that have not been proven to respire and produce BChl a aerobically, then those reads cannot be linked to AAP specifically. Instead, they are putative anoxygenic phototrophs with undetermined oxic tolerances.

However, many mutations observed in evolution and disease are the result of insertions or deletions (indels) and the impact of these mutations are poorly predicted computationally relative to missense mutations. While a few other papers have profiled InDels in a systematic way, the major contributions of this paper are: 1) profiling indels across many different proteins (9), 2) profiling InDels for both stability and function, 3) introducing the concept of high throughput profiling of DelSub mutations (Mutations that remove an aa and substitute an aa in a single event) The authors make a library of substitutions, insertions and deletions of 9 protein domains.

They then go deep on two peptide binding domains, comparing functional mutational scans as well. This provides a rich set of data to compare to computational predictions, where notable limitations in current prediction methods are identified. The major limitation of the paper is in the presentation - there is a lot of data and the figures are quite complex - but the text is brief and difficult to follow in parts. An expanded text and breaking up the figures into more figures would likely improve the ability to extract insights from these impressive datasets. Additionally further discussion of the results within the context of past literature would be helpful in guiding interpretation of the study. **Major points:** - The authors included 9 domains that span classical motifs to include in their indel scan. From our reading, it is unclear what rationale the authors used to include these domains. What makes these a diverse set of domains (a/b content? size? eukaryotic/prokaryotic origin? other topological features? etc)? This will help the reader understand how to generalise the results. - In section “Evaluating indel variant effect prediction”, authors can comment on why PROVEAN is better suited to predict insertions and deletions relative to substitutions. In contrast, why CADD predicts substitutions better than PROVEAN? What design choices can distinguish PROVEAN from CADD? Is there a way a model could be trained that could perform well on both? - In the section “Structural determinants of indel tolerance,” the authors mention multiple features that seem potentially important for the effects of insertions and deletions. Currently specific patterns are discussed for the substitutions but the main draw of this manuscript it contains indel mutagenesis across many proteins and the discussion in this section regarding indels are vague beyond that indels are more tolerated at the N and C termini, that the secondary structure is important, and where the indel is seems to have an impact. Currently in our reading these are vague descriptions and perhaps it would be possible to describe general trends? What specific lengths are tolerated vs not? Which secondary structural elements are more sensitive? It would be helpful to clarify these trends with existing literature. For example, previous work in a potassium channel kir2.1 (Macdonald, CM, Genome Biology 2023) found that deletions were more disruptive than insertions in beta sheets especially. Is that also seen? - The authors train a model as described in the ‘Accurate indel variant effect prediction’ section to predict the effects of indels within all the proteins that are contained within the screen and another manuscript Tsuboyama et al. However, there are other previous indel scans that have been done including one within a viral AAV capsid protein ( www.science.org ="""" doi="""" 10.1126="""" science.aaw2900="""">), a potassium channel kir2.1 ( genomebiology.biomedcentral... ="""" articles="""" 10.1186="""" s13059-023-02880-6#citeas="""">), and an amyloid protein that involved the senior author ( pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ="""" 36400770=""""/>). It may be useful to test performance of the model on these datasets that were not generated within the same study and discuss where the model performs well vs those that do not perform as well. - The authors find that insertions can generate gain-of-function molecular phenotypes at higher rates relative to deletions and substitutions. Overall, the manuscript presents the results of deep indel mutagenesis on several protein domains, but lacks thorough discussion of the results. A discussion addressing the possibility of non-native ligand binding following indel mutations would provide an evolutionary perspective that contextualises this research. - The authors mention that some gain-of-function mutations occur due to short insertion mutations. While some domain insertions have been shown to have stabilising effects ( doi.org ="""" 10.1371="""" journal.pcbi.1006008="""">, doi.org ="""" 10.1038="""" s41467-018-08171-0="""">, www.nature.com ="""" articles="""" s41467-021-27342-0="""">), the findings presented here are novel for being short insertions but prior work on domains and deletions of varying type being beneficial would be useful. Emphasising this in the “Insertions generate gain-of-function molecular phenotypes” section and considering how the insertions in the PSD95-PDZ3 domain might increase stability would enhance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving these gain-of-function phenotypes. - Related to gain-of-function: The last sentence of the discussion section references the potential usefulness of indel mutagenesis for protein engineering. As the paper notes, the results here will impact the protein engineering field significantly, so further discussion here will help extend the reach of this paper. Discussing what protein engineering strategies would be enhanced (e.g. directed evolution) would help the reader in evaluating the impact of the data presented. There are a few related papers in the literature (e.g.[ https://doi.org/10.1073/pna... ]( https://doi.org/10.1073/pna... that could support this. **Minor points:** - Several of the figures are very information-dense. This manuscript would benefit from breaking up these figures and reorganizing them to make them easier to understand. It may be helpful also to focus the figures on the main points the authors would like to make within the manuscript as currently the sheer amount of data and analyses makes it difficult to follow the narrative. Additionally, figures could benefit from having secondary structure representations above or below heatmaps to aid in interpretation. - Figure 1 contains A-C labeled sections but contains 9 comprehensive experiments with 6 subpanels each. It is very difficult to evaluate the data when it is so densely represented. aligning an “unfolded” secondary structure below the heatmap for all domains might be clearer than colouring by secondary structure. We find secondary structure coloring to obscure the patterns. - Figure 2 would benefit from significant reorganization perhaps around SH3 and PDZ domains specifically. The spacing within this figure makes it difficult to follow the immense amount of comparisons contained here. Perhaps it would be worth separating this figure up or moving some of the comparisons to the supplement. As in Figure 1 secondary structure above or below the heatmaps would be helpful. - In figure 5E data is shown for GRB2-SH3 in which some mutants show high binding and low abundance. Additionally these mutants are most prevalent in the core and surface. What could be an explanation for such a phenotype for core mutants, since they are bound to have the most destabilizing effect. For the surface mutants, are those residues close to the binding site? Additionally the distributions of these two plots look fundamentally different (with a much higher correlation between binding and abundance for PDZ and a distinct change in the pattern of binding residues being gain or loss of function across the two domains). What does that say about the baseline stability of GRB2 vs PSD95? Or is this more representative of some methodological aspect of the dynamic range and sensitivity within respective assays when run on these specific proteins? - In the heatmap figures the coloring is confusing. Currently they are colored from red to white to blue - in the corresponding color bars next to the heatmaps white is not centered at 0. Presumably 0 is wildtype fitness and blue and red are greater and less than wildtype fitness, respectively. This should be explicitly stated within all figure legends. White should correspond to 0 otherwise it makes it difficult to determine the effect of a mutation. - Figure 3E contains violin plots however a boxplot is missing from these that indicates the median, interquartile range, and whiskers to represent non-outlier distributions. This would be useful in comparing across these variant types - In ‘Materials and Methods’ section, we were confused by the filtering steps taken in the ‘sequence data processing’ section. It would be helpful to include the minimum read cut-off. - Figure 4b should be explained more completely in the figure legend. It is very difficult to make out what the difference in colour for each panel means. - In the last paragraph of the introduction, it would provide additional support and context if you referenced other work with similar findings.

I especially like the testing of different homology arm lengths. The use of non-plant exonucleases is very innovative. I have one comment which I think is needed and would improve the paper .With the Arabidopsis transformants it reads like you are screening in the T1 generation. Is this correct? If so I think it should be made explicit in the paper. Assuming they are T1 plants I think it is important to indicate what proportion of T1 transgenic plants have undergone successful HDR using the donor template. It looks like your experimental design makes it difficult to quantify this as there is not another selection cassette on the T-DNA beyond the GL1 sgRNA which produces a phenotype which cannot be selected for in these mutants if not grown on thiamine. The growth of the thiC mutants on media lacking thiamine necessarily selects against transgenics where T-DNA integration has occurred and HDR has not. As it stands I think the number of seeds sown in this experiment needs to be documented at a minimum. However I would suggest repeating that experiment with a T-DNA which allows selection for transformants on thiamine selected media and either screening T1 plants via PCR and maybe growing on media lacking thiamine in the T2 generation, perhaps the editing of gl1 in the T1 generation can indicate which T2 families should be screened. This would give a better picture of the efficiency especially if people are interested in targeting loci without a phenotype so amenable to selection",2023-11-27T16:40:43,disqus_OzaiuqP6Ey,Geoffrey Thomson,10.1101/2023.11.24.568561,Efficient scar-free knock-ins of several kilobases by engineered CRISPR/Cas endonucleases,"Tom Schreiber, Anja Prange, Petra Schäfer, Thomas Iwen, Ramona Grützner, Sylvestre Marillonnet, Alain Tissier",2023-11-25

I have a technical question regarding the insertion of the targeting sequences into the provirus. I see that you transformed the library into DH5alpha E. coli (or, well, NEB's version of it). In my experience, even when grown at 30C, proviral plasmids grown in this strain (as well as in NEB10beta) can exhibit LTR-LTR recombination, resulting in a heavily truncated form of the plasmid that excludes the entire provirus but retains the antibiotic resistance gene, which grows competitively against the full-length plasmid. The result of these recombination events is that you end up isolating what might look like ""good plasmid"" in terms of DNA yield, but actually makes very poor virus stocks as the majority of the plasmid in the prep does not even contain the proviral sequence. These recombination events can be monitored by simply running the uncut plasmids on a gel and looking for a prominent band around ~3 kb (corresponding to the supercoiled form of the truncated plasmid which should be ~5 kb in length). Long-read (e.g. Nanopore) whole-plasmid sequencing is another great way to detect and quantify the frequency of these recombination events. Switching to NEB Stable E. coli (also grown at 30C) is a fantastic way to reduce the frequency of LTR-LTR recombination. You did a great job dealing with the repetitive sequences in nef to prevent those smaller recombination events, but I am wondering if you have looked for any such LTR-LTR recombination events that would happen already in the E. coli transformants, and if so, do you know how frequent they might be?

As our manuscript was under review and ultimately accepted in the meantime ( https://rdcu.be/drgAc), we did not manage to address all the issues you mentioned for the peer-reviewed version. With respect to PC vs NMDS: we have adopted the method of doing both analysis since PC plots are limited to two variables in each iteration and this can cause statistical limitations with smaller sample sizes (as is the case here). NMDS collapses the variability to two dimensions and does not assume normal distribution. We use these two analyses in a complementary manner (one does not influence the outcome of the other, they are two independent methods). As our interest here was limited to inspect if the data is powerful enough to distinguish expression patterns at the respective time points, we did not focus on further discussion of these tests. With respect to identifying secreted proteins, we used SignalP5 and TMHMM to identify candidate secreted soluble proteins. This was only mentioned int he methods section and we could have added this in the results section, as well. We used the pipeline detailed in Figure 4 to identify the transcripts as noncoding. The tool CPC with a cutoff of an ORF length of 200 bp was used for that. Once again, thank you for your feedback!
