Review synthesized by Richa Arya. General comments It may be helpful to elaborate on how it is established that CHIP mobility is dependent on activity. The conclusion in the paper has been primarily drawn from the catalytically inactive H260Q mutant which is less mobile. However the fact that the puncta of the mutant are brighter and larger than the wild type and that it recovers slowly also indicates the protein might be inherently more prone to aggregation upon heat shock. Related to the above point, under conditions such as VER treatment and Act-D treatment, the nucleolar recruitment is unaltered but recovery is affected (which implies mobility may be affected). This leads to the accumulation of CHIP in the nucleus. In these scenarios, it may be relevant to report on the status of wild type CHIP activity? Conducting the ubiquitination assay as in Figure 5A with Act-D and Ver treatment would be informative. If no difference in ubiquitination is observed, it can be concluded that it is not the change in CHIP mobility that affects its activity, but rather it's activity that promotes CHIP mobility/dynamics (the conclusion from Figure 5). o Figure 1 : The question arises as to why the control and recovery show puncta in panel C, but not the HS condition. Also, to make it easier to appreciate the nucleolar localization of CHIP in the HS condition, zoomed in regions and overlay images would be useful. Figure 1b : To support interpretation of the results, it would be helpful to highlight some examples of the nucleolar localization of CHIP. Additionally, it looks like there are specific dots (that could be like condensates) in the Control and Recovered, but not during the Heat Shock cells, not in panel B. Maybe some quantification such as number of dots per cell/ intensity/size could accompany the images. Similar parameters of the condensate structures in the nuclei in the transiently transfected cells could be quantified. Figure 1 : Quantifications such as 2B and 2C could also be done for Figure 1, for both Hsp70 and CHIP. Figure 1E..’ K30A mutant exhibited impaired CHIP migration to nucleoli after heat shock (Fig. 1E)… ’ How strong is this impairment? Could it be quantified either by fluorescence intensity or via Western blot of the different cellular fractions. o Figure 2 : It would be helpful to have additional clarification on what the different parameters such as -""% of cells with EGFP-CHIP in the nucleolus' or 'CHIP intensity in the nucleolus' represent, as well as clarification on the transition from measuring CHIP nucleolar-to-nucleus intensity ratios for immunostaining (as in Fig S1E) to measuring just nucleolar CHIP intensities in the main Figure for the EGFP-CHIP overexpression experiments. Perhaps a western blot showing HSP70 expression with VER might be helpful in demonstrating that total protein expression is not affected and that it is only its activity being affected. ‘ a small molecule inhibitor of HSP70… ’ Some suggestions alongside the loss of function assays such as knockdown and inhibitor treatment: What happens to Hsp70 and thereby CHIP translocation to the nucleus in cells with high, medium versus low levels of HSP70 expression? Do the high-expressing cells show more enhanced CHIP recruitment to the nucleolus? Can it be quantified as to how correlated the efficiency of recruitment of CHIP is to the expression level of Hsp70? How does the nucleolar translocation of Hsp70 itself correlate with its expression level? Figure 2a : It is clear that the HSP70 co-localises with CHIP upon heat shock. Overlaid images might be better to highlight this but the use of green and red is not ideal for colour-blind readers. May be changed for bar graphs too (2d,e). Figure 2b,c : There is a question about the statement that mutant CHIP was unable to localise in the nucleoli due to lack of HSP70 binding in Fig 1E. In Fig 2B and 2C CHIP was able to migrate into the nucleoli (albeit at a lesser extent) with HSP70 knockdown? Maybe images corresponding to this experiment might help as well to allow the reader to see the difference in localisation? It is mentioned that CHIP auto-ubiquitination is important in its localisation in Fig 5 so does the CHIP K30A mutant necessarily verify that the lack of HSP70 binding is causing impaired migration to the nucleus in Fig 1E? Could K30A also affect its auto-ubiquitination? Suggest referencing supplementary figure 2 alongside Fig 2B and 2C, and changing the dots in this graph to red, to make it consistent with panel F. Figure 2d,e : Bar plots could be replaced with scatter plots showing individual data points as done in Supp. Fig 1E. Adding t1/2 values with FRAP traces would support the changes observed for recovery times across conditions. Calculating mobile fraction and reporting would also be helpful. Figure 2f,g : Suggest updating the figure legend to clearly distinguish both curves. Some additions may complement the FRAP analysis presented: - How does the FRAP mobility of CHIP compare between absence and presence of heat shock? - How does the FRAP mobility of CHIP compare in the recovery phase in presence and absence of heat Ver? - Is the CHIP mobility different in nucleolus versus nucleus? ‘and HSP70 inhibition did not si+gnificantly reduce its dynamics (Fig. 2F)… ’ Would there be any change in CHIP dynamics in siHSP70 cells? It would be helpful to mention this following Fig 2B/C. Maybe use 'mobility' instead of dynamics, to be more specific. o Figure3 : It will be helpful to include an overlay/merged image of the two channels, and to explain in the legend how the measured correlation coefficient is obtained. It would be nice to see what kind of sub-structures show the maximum colocalization. Fig 3c : HS+Rec condition should show a loss of correlation between CHIP and NPM1 and is an important control in this figure. Comparison with Fibrilarin is good, demonstrating a loss of correlation between the NPM1 and CHIP themselves under different conditions and data for Ctrl only conditions would also add value. o ‘it altered CHIP distribution, which more prominently overlapped with Act D-induced NPM1 ring formations (Fig. 4D)… ’ Can this be quantified? Maybe it will show more pronounced colocalization compared to heatshock alone. o  ' this observation suggests that proper nucleolar assembly may be necessary for CHIP dynamics'. It may be worth specifying the reference to Dynamics here: 1. Mobility measured via FRAP 2. Translocation efficiency done via intensity measurement or ration of nucleolus/nucleus intensity. FRAP measurement of CHIP may be helpful to conclude about the mobility of CHIP in the nucleolus upon heat shock, in presence or absence of Act D pre-treatment. A change in mobility may support the lack of translocation during the recovery phase in presence of Act D. o Figure 4 : (a) It may be worth commenting on why the Hoechst staining looks different between the Control and the Act-D conditions. Fig4d: It could be helpful to add images of NPM1 localization in cells treated with Act D, but not under heat shock. In other words, are these NPM1 rings specific to the heat shock response? The size of the cells and the nucleus are different for HS versus Act-D+HS panels. If the scale bar is consistent and this is a normally observed morphological change upon Act-D treatment, it might be helpful to note this size difference in the legend. o   ‘ We found that the activity of CHIP is not indispensable for heat shock-induced migration to the nucleolus (Fig. 5B). However, FRAP analysis of the nucleolar CHIP H260Q mutant showed a decrease in its dynamics compared to CHIP WT… ’ Maybe the fragment could be rewritten for clarity (e.g. is dispensable). What happens to the mutant CHIPH260Q localization upon recovery? Is it slower than wt? Is more mutant CHIP retained in the nucleolus upon recovery? o Figure 5 : Suggest showing a wt image as comparison, in panel B. An alternate interpretation for the observations with H260Q mutant could be that the mutation leads to instability and misfolding of CHIP (as suggested in the paper) which leads to increased aggregation (larger and brighter droplets, low mobility) upon heat shock with itself and other interacting proteins. This interpretation does not need to invoke a loss of ubiquitination activity as a cause, it could be another consequence of misfolded CHIP. Figure 5c: How do the mobility of wild type CHIP compare with the H260Q mutant in the nucleus or in absence of heat shock? If the mobility is the same during pre-heat shock/pre-translocation to the nucleolus, the wild type and mutant protein have inherently similar dynamics. And if this gets altered only in the nucleolus of heat shocked cells, it would support the conclusion that it is the activity of CHIP that helps retain its mobility in the nucleolus and possibly prevent its aggregation in this compartment. Figure 5f : If there were two independent experiments, can both be represented? Or was the data pooled from the two experiments?? Suggest representing the data as two points for CHIP wild type and mutant each, from two independent experiments. Figure 5g,h,i : Dot plot overlay on the boxplot might be nice to see the spread of datapoints. o    	‘ Interestingly, sizeable intra-nucleolar CHIP droplet-like structures could be observed after overnight heat shock in cells expressing the CHIP H260Q mutant, outnumbering their WT protein counterparts (Fig. 5E-I)… ’ In Figure 1C some bright foci are also observed in control and recovered cells. Are these similar to the ""droplet-like structures"" described here? o    	‘ These differences between CHIP WT and mutant assemblies may stem from the alterations in CHIP H260Q dynamics within the nucleolus (Fig. 5C and D) ’. Similar measurement as in Fig 5C could be done upon overnight heatshock to support this statement. o    	‘ Surprisingly, we found comparable redistribution of all CHIP variants to nucleoli during heat shock, suggesting an… '. Is this a cell line-specific difference, or could it be due to differences in approach, i.e. stable cell line vs. transient overexpression? Similar transient expressions in HeLa may help clarify this. o   Based on Fig S1E, it appears there might be both an HSP70 activity-dependent (smaller) and HSP70 activity-independent (larger) contributions to CHIP localization. VER treatment reduces CHIP relocalization to the nucleus by a small but significant amount both in control and HS-treated cells. o  Cell transfection - Suggest reporting the confluency of the cells before transfection (or at which they were seeded). Methods - In Figs 3C and 5G-I, there is a concern about the statistical approach to calculate p-values based on multiple measurements (nuclei) within each sample. The t-test and ANOVA assume that each measurement is independent, and multiple nuclei within the same sample are not independent. Recommend to either not report p-values or to average together the values from each sample and calculate the p-value using those sample-level means.

http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/03/07/042598#comment-5899350504,biorxivstage,4,"POSSIBLE MACROEVOLUTIONARY EXPLANATION Graham Coop appears content with this bioRxiv preprint publication, which would seem to present a true “version of record” of his thinking in 2016. (He did not have his text modified in response to the whims of journal reviewers or need to suffer the stylistic corrections of journal copyeditors.) Among those who provided feedback on earlier drafts, Coop lists Vince Buffalo who later (2021), more formally addressed the same topic in consultation with Coop (1). However, rather than naming bioRxiv directly, Buffalo cited Coop (2016) as having published in “Cold Spring Harbor Labs Journals” (2). This would seem not to have been picked up by automatic search engines, so no link to Buffalo (2021) is so far evident at this site. This is regrettable since Buffalo goes beyond Coop (and other commentators; 3) in suggesting that we should be considering macroevolutionary explanations for the failure of consensus population size ( Nc) to relate to population diversity (“Lewontin’s paradox”): Finally, beyond just accounting for phylogenetic non-independence, macroevolution and phylogenetic comparative methods are a promising way to approach across-species population genomic questions. For example, one could imagine that diversication processes could contribute to Lewontin’s Paradox. If large-Nc species were to have a rate of speciation that is greater than the rate at which mutation and drift reach equilibrium (which is indeed slower for large Nc  species), this could act to decouple diversity from census population size. That is to say, even if the rate of random demographic bottlenecks were constant across taxa, lineage-specic diversication processes could lead certain clades to be systematically further from demographic equilibrium, and thus have lower diversity than expected for their census population size.

Review synthesized by Ruchika Bajaj. The paper reports the use of an optimized computational model, GMMA, by preparing a randomly mutated protein library and screening the mutant library using an in-vivo genetic sensor for folding for successful protein engineering efforts. Here are a few points of feedback on the paper. 1. In the second paragraph of section, “Resilience towards mutations reflects thermodynamic stability”, the manuscript refers to the design of degenerate primers, “These were designed to cover the C-terminal half of edF106, amino acid residues 48-97”. Further explanation for designing degenerate primers for these specific positions would be helpful to the reader, for example by adding references from the literature. In the same paragraph, when mentioning the size of the library (10,000 - 20,000), it would be good to explain the reason for the specified size of this library. 2. The section, “GMMA analysis discovers stability effects”, mentions that, “Reliable stability effects could be assigned to 374 out of the 838 unique substitutions in the library”. Further explanation may be provided in this regard, for example to describe why/what variables could lead to unreliable stability scores for tested substitutions. 3. The study evaluated MM3 and MM6 combinations for the additivity of stability. It would be relevant to mention if other combinations like MM4 and MM5 were evaluated. 4. Fig 2b: more points could be taken on the steep regions. 5. For Supplementary Figures 4 and 5, please provide an explanation of curves or straight lines and explain the angle of fitted lines. 6. In the section “stability measurements validate GMMA”, in the sentence, “Thus, mutations which could be stabilizing in the fusion might behave differently outside of the CPOP context.”, would it be possible to elaborate more on this statement to clarify how the behavior may differ?. 7. Please indicate specific mutated amino acids in multiple mutants: MM3, MM6 and MM9, for comparison. 8. Please label residues in Figure 6b. 9. In the section, “Crystal structures show increased similarity to the 1FB0 design template”, the statement, “Only one or two would yield crystals indicative of a conformational change taking place in order to stabilize the crystal lattice.” Conformational change is questionable here, especially with low RMSD values. Would it be possible to elaborate on the statement or reframe it. 10. “showed much better agreement with its original design template spinach thioredoxin (PDB: 1FB0).” It may be helpful to provide some further context about this in the Introduction and conclusions sections. 11. In the section, “structure and sequence-based methods do not predict most stabilizing variants”, the text mentions the discrepancies in rosetta and GMMM. It may be relevant to provide some further discussion on what may be behind those discrepancies. 12. Although the mutated protein has been crystallized, a discussion on protein expression or oligomerization after the mutation and its relation to thermal stability would be helpful for the study. 13. A major point which has not been mentioned in this study is scoring of these mutations according to their function, functional aspects are important for the purpose of protein engineering and thus this could be relevant. It will also be good to correlate the stability of these mutants with its function to comprehend the protein engineering effort. 14. Minor point: In the section, “Initial library transformation”, please change “scraped off” to picked off. 15, Supplementary Table 4: Wilson B factor value is missing for eMM9. A possible explanation for the difference in the number of macromolecules in MM9 and eMM9 variants would be helpful. Is there a possibility of change in crystallographic oligomerization ?

Namely, how neuroscientists should interpret functional MRI signals at very high spatial resolutions with respect to the underlying neuronal and vascular activation changes. This manuscript extends previously described models of the conventional BOLD fMRI contrast and augments it to incorporate the additional (partly orthogonal) information about blood volume changes. This advanced model makes it possible to provide a more comprehensive understanding of various compartments of the brain's vascular tree. The authors then uses a combination of self-acquired/self-analyzed cutting-edge layer-fMRI data, to investigate the model parameters and draw novel conclusions about both: (1) the plausible range of vascular features (e.g. CBVrest) and (2) the working principle and interpretability of common layer-fMRI acquisitions methods (GE-BOLD and VASO). Some of the most important take-home messages are: -> The modeling work confirms that GE-BOLD is contaminated by locally un-specific draining veins, while the VASO-method is mostly insensitive to those contaminations, as expected. -> Novel insights about the emerging VASO technique are: A) the VASO signal is partly coming from diving arterioles with reduced layer-specific localization specificity. B) the empirically measured CBV changes are somewhat plausible with a wide range of possible baseline CBV values. while preferring larger baseline values. Overall, I think it makes a lot of sense that the authors find the best correspondence of simulated and empirical data for larger baseline CBV values than previously assumed. These previously assumed values were based on ex-vivo data. And it is known that cadavers have less blood in the parenchyma (dead people are pale). -> This is the first comprehensive layer-fMRI VASO paper of the human primary visual system. While exploratory studies in previous publications have already implied the feasibility of layer-fMRI VASO in human V1 (Huber et al., 2021: Progress in Neurobiology), this manuscript is the first study to show its robust applicability across groups of participants. This has important implications for a large user base (readership of this journal). I am sure that many other layer-fMRI VASO users will soon jump on this brain too. I want to acknowledge that an earlier BioRxiv version of this manuscript was discussed in the Maastricht layer seminar. I want to acknowledge input of other seminar attendees for their insights in discussing this paper (particularly Faruk Gulban, Alessandra Pizzuti, and Sebastian Dresbach). I have reviewed as previous version of this manuscript as being part of a PhD Thesis containing a chapter (3) referring to this manuscript: https://espace.library.uq.e.... I want to thank my co-assessors for discussing this manuscript. My comments during the thesis viva are already included in this revised version of the manuskript (e.g. discussions about segmentation quality). Thus, I do not have any remaining major concerns about the manuscript. Though, I have two stylistic comments: -> In light of B1-inhomogeneities, potential inflow effects, BOLD contaminations and many other constraints, it is not trivial to set up a VASO sequence at 7T. Maybe it would be appropriate to cite the first VASO study at 7T (Hua et al. 2013, MRM, 10.1002/mrm.24334). -> When I had discussed figure 4 with my department head, he was suspicious whether or not a GM mask was applied to make the VASO results look like they are more specific to the GM. Maybe the authors can explicitly state in the figure caption if this was the case or not. I encourage the publication of the manuscript with great enthusiasm. Conflict of interest statement: I am in a loose collaboration with the second author Saskia Bollman: We share co-authorship as middle authors for the preprint by Faruk Gulban ( https://www.biorxiv.org/con....

A few points after running the data, copy pasting from my blog... - in terms of fine scale ancestry, the Erfurt Jews show enough variation to be divided into three or four clusters, as opposed to just two as per Waldman et al. - some of the Erfurt Jews show excess ""Mediterranean"" ancestry, while others excess ""North African"" ancestry, and this cannot be explained with ancestral populations similar to Lebanese and/or South Italians, but rather with significant gene flow from the western Mediterranean and possibly North Africa - several of the Erfurt Jews show relatively high levels of ""East Asian"" ancestry that cannot be explained with admixture from Russians, or even any Russian-like populations, because such populations almost lack this type of ancestry, and instead show significant ""Siberian"" admixture - as far as I can see, there are no correlations between any of the observations above and the quality of the samples. That is, low coverage doesn't appear to be causing the aforementioned excess ""Mediterranean"", ""North African"" and/or ""East Asian"" ancestry proportions.

Diet-Related Metabolic Perturbations of Gut Microbial Shikimate Pathway-Tryptamine-tRNA Aminoacylation-Protein Synthesis in Human Health and Disease Abstract Human gut bacterial Na(+)-transporting NADH:ubiquinone reductase (NQR) sequence is associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, Alzheimer disease-associated sequence (ADAS) is further characterized in cultured spore-forming Clostridium sp. Tryptophan and NQR substrate ubiquinone have common precursor chorismate in microbial shikimate pathway. Tryptophan-derived tryptamine presents in human diet and gut microbiome. Tryptamine inhibits tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) with consequent neurodegeneration in cell and animal models. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase inhibition causes protein biosynthesis impairment similar to that revealed in AD. Tryptamine-induced TrpRS gene-dose reduction is associated with TrpRS protein deficiency and cell death. In animals, tryptamine treatment results in toxicity, weight gain, and prediabetes-related hypoglycemia. Sequence analysis of gut microbiome database reveals 89% to 100% ADAS nucleotide identity in American Indian (Cheyenne and Arapaho [C&A]) Oklahomans, of which ~93% being overweight or obese and 50% self-reporting type 2 diabetes (T2D). Alzheimer disease-associated sequence occurs in 10.8% of C&A vs 1.3% of healthy American population. This observation is of considerable interest because T2D links to AD and obesity. Alzheimer disease-associated sequence prevails in gut microbiome of colorectal cancer, which linked to AD. Metabolomics revealed that tryptamine, chorismate precursor quinate, and chorismate product 4-hydroxybenzoate (ubiquinone precursor) are significantly higher, while tryptophan-containing dipeptides are lower due to tRNA aminoacylation deficiency in C&A compared with non-native Oklahoman who showed no ADAS. Thus, gut microbial tryptamine overproduction correlates with ADAS occurrence. Antibiotic and diet additives induce ADAS and tryptamine. Mitogenic/cytotoxic tryptamine cause microbial and human cell death, gut dysbiosis, and consequent disruption of host-microbe homeostasis. Present analysis of 1246 participants from 17 human gut metagenomics studies revealed ADAS in cell death diseases. More links to our relevant published articles available and delivered to corresponding authors. Our earlier studies demonstrated that tryptamine induces glucose metabolism alterations in blood and in brain.

I'm going to take it step by step, commenting on clarity as I read through the paper. - I stumbled a few times in the abstract.  "" A deeper sampling of individual ants from two colonies that included all available castes (pupae, larvae, workers, female and male alates), from both before and after adaptation to controlled laboratory conditions, revealed that ant microbiomes from each colony, caste, and rearing condition were typically conserved within but not between each sampling category."" What does ""deeper"" mean, is it that you sampled ants from each caste?  (the way it's phrased now, it sounds somewhat detached, like stating that the colony had castes without stating that you sampled them) So colony number, caste, and wild vs lab are sampling categories?  What would it mean ""within, but not between each sampling category""? - What kind of sequencing did you do?  I'd like to see at a glance which -omics you are doing, right at the start of the paper, because I sometimes look for papers that use a particular method. - You use ""Tenericute"" in the abstract, and ""Mollicute"" in the Importance section.  For the readers unfamiliar with the two, it might be good to disambiguate. - The Importance section is somewhat long and repeats a lot of the abstract.  What made you want to do this study?  That no one has studied this ant's microbiomes?  That the findings might extrapolate to other ants?  That you could say something about individuality and colonial organization or evolution from the members' microbiomes? - ""Honey bee queens, workers, and drones also each have unique gut microbiomes, where worker microbiomes are more diverse than those of queens and drones, possibly due to worker foraging (9).""  ""Unique"" has the connotation of being individual, rather than a group characteristic.  Would ""discrete"" be a better term?  And I'm a bit confused by ""more diverse"".  Diverse how?  Is the meaning that the range of species within the microbial community is somehow wider on the taxonomic tree?  Or something else? - But now reading that honey bees have a core microbiome that is found in all colonies and castes.  But were we not talking about ""more diverse""? - ""However, strains [...]""  just need to be a bit clearer on what are these strains of. - What makes these microbiomes ""low-diversity""? - "" the samples collected from each colony were not differentiated from each other"" is unclear.  Do you mean that the team collected ants of caste X from all 25 colonies into a single blended sample?  Try to rephrase "" Whether the 19 common bacteria found in Texas T. septentrionalis and form a conserved microbiome that is found in other geographic regions or castes is also unknown."" is unclear to me.  Maybe try to break it up into shorter sentences. - ""major driver"" might suggest causality.  I think you mean that the differences in the presence or absence of those symbionts are producing the statistical effect of seeing differences between microbiomes, is that correct? - ""Colony JKH000270 lab-maintained ants were sampled after a year and 4 months (some male alates were sampled earlier) and Colony JKH000307 lab-maintained ants were sampled after 4 months."" I'm wondering if the time factor would be important in microbiome adaptation.  If it is, can the two colonies really be compared to each other?  Would you mind adding a couple of sentences to explain the procedure? - I'm not sure I understand how pupae and ant guts and whole ants will act as confirmatory datasets.  Would you mind elaborating? - ""Reads that were not classified as belonging to the kingdom Bacteria (i.e., those identified as Archaea or Eukaryote) using the SILVA database v128 (43, 44) were removed.""  I understand that including viruses, other fungi, diatoms, etc. would change the scope of the project.

The language is clear and engaging.  I do have some questions and comments that I hope might be helpful. - ""integral parts of an imperialist enterprise [20]. Imperialism granted Western scientists unprecedented access to the world, which they translated into scientific authority, power, and wealth,""  When I first read that, I  thought you meant ""power and wealth"" as in technology that spurred the Industrial Revolution.  Later on in the paper, you elaborate that it is the power of Global North academics over academics in the Global South.  I'm also thinking that maybe applied science, such as concentration of Big Pharma exploration and production would generate power and wealth today?  Later on, you write "" Implicit in this perspective is that first authorship, and authorship of publications in general, are ways to establish authority and accumulate power in knowledge production, which in itself is worth questioning. For example, how do established authorship norms promote inequity and dominance in Western science (e.g. [74])?"" Pretty much the question I had.  So, would it be possible to phrase the statement that is at the start of the paper in some way that lets me know to wait for that discussion at the end of the paper? You go on to explain:  ""The imperialistic dynamics that created the current structures of access and power within Western science between the Global North and South have also enabled Western science to assert dominance in global knowledge production [76], while erasing, appropriating, and subjugating Indigenous knowledge and authority. "" Which leads me to believe that you only meant academia power.  So, basically, I'm a bit confused by the flow.  But the ideas themselves are powerful and I'm glad to read them. - ""through foundational practices""  I understand that you mean foundational to science, not the imperialism here? - ""as expertise about the natural world continues to be disproportionately claimed by the Global North through publication practices.  Our findings serve as a case study that reflects the inequitable structures at the core of Western biodiversity science and their resulting disparities, e.g. in access, labor, collaboration, power, and designations of expertise and authority."".  To me, this is the most important statement.  And yet it's pretty far down, at the very end of the Introduction section.  On the one hand, I understand that it is the last step in a logical chain.  On the other, I would still like it to be one of the first things I see, to let me know what I'm reading towards. - ""This study shows how historical inequity continues to shape present day research practices""  I'm not sure it does?  To me, it shows the historical inequity, and it shows that inequity is still here today.  But I don't know if the paper describes the mechanism by which one generates the other.  And don't think it needs to, what the paper focuses on is far more important.  So I'd just rephrase that a bit to remove the suggestion of causality.  ""Things are bad.  Things are still bad.  We should think about that and fix it."" - ""1960"".  I'm cool with missing the years between 1950 and 1960, I just want to see a phrase acknowledging that, and saying you accounted for it in the statistics. - ""we did not include descriptions in which the species was extinct at the time of description""  Could you add a quick phrase explaining why?  As a fresh reader, I thought ""I'd feel it an honor to have a dinosaur named after me"".  And I'm genuinely curious what is the quality of that honor that makes it different from having a current species. - ""The prevalence of first authors from the Global South increases significantly toward the present (R2 = 0.143, p = 0.014), but the prevalence of first authors from the Global North remains consistent (R2 = 6.749e-5, p = 0.947) "" Is it not a zero-sum calculation?  Earlier, you make a similar statement, but without the word ""first"", so I concluded that Global South authors were being included as author lists generally grew in length.  But there can be only one first author per paper, so I'm confused by the calculation here. - In this paper, you speak of inclusion of Global South stakeholders in Western science.  You also speak of inclusion of Indigenous knowledge and worldviews in science.  So the ""The patterns of authorship we observed show that researchers from the Global South have increasing opportunities to participate in Western science""  statement feels like it's missing a piece. - ""prioritizes the Global North’s power to theorize and conceptualize [...] frames the value of people and their perspectives in terms of how they can benefit those currently in power"" and""Paradoxically, as taxonomic work has been devalued, [...] the roles of different individuals, and how different roles are supported and valued (intellectually and materially)""  Loved reading this. - ""Adhering to the fallacy of neutrality (which is in fact a non-neutral stance and one embedded in white supremacy;""  I understand that thinking one is neutral is a fallacy.  But how is it a non-neutral stance embedded in white supremacy?  Is it because privileged people have the ability to not see problems and therefore think they're being neutral?  I would want to see a bit more clarity in this phrasing.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.02.494602v1#comment-5888374621,biorxivstage,4,"The manuscript entitled “Feasibility of 3T layer-dependent fMRI with GE-BOLD using NORDIC and phase regression” explores whether 3T sub-millimeter MRI with 3D-EPI readouts can be a reliable tool for human layer-fMRI. The results suggest that it is indeed feasible. I find this very exciting and an impactful message to the emerging field of mesoscopic (laminar) fMRI. While most layer-fMRI studies are being conducted at one of the ≈ 100 installed 7T, this study shows that layer-fMRI can be extended to a much larger user base of ≈ 10.000 3T scanners installed worldwide. There are about a dozen 3T layer-fMRI studies published already (most are referenced in the manuscript). The study here stands out in the way it aims to generate voxel-wise activation scores with efficient EPI readout and produces layer profiles from small ‘columnar’ patches of the cortex. Most other previous studies used FLASH-based readouts to investigate fMRI signal mechanisms at very long TRs and/or had to collapse fMRI data from large brain areas together to generate one layer-profile. The approach presented here makes layer-fMRI at 3T more feasibly applicable for conventional neuroscience studies. It becomes apparent that the authors paid a lot of attention to high-level fMRI processing strategies and the highest possible quality of applying those. For example, the authors developed and employed a layer-fMRI quality score of inter-trial beta consistency across depth. I really like this measure on multiple levels: A) it can account for potential statistical inflation in NORDIC, B) it can provide a measure of data quality in absence of a ground truth layer profile, C) it allows comparisons across different analysis pipelines with different voxel-wise noise levels. Overall, I find the layer-profiles of the raw data quite convincing already (right panel in Fig. 3a). They are also quite reproducible across trials. While I appreciate the application of phase regression and NORDIC, these processing steps come along with some level of uncertainty and additional dependencies of their precise application setup and inherent assumptions. Thus, I admired the author's approach to show raw and filtered data next to each other. Furthermore, I appreciated the studies focus on high-quality pre-processing and acquiring a structural VASO scan to guide the alignment between BOLD-EPI and MP2RAGE data. I also appreciated the author's decision to only use half of the trials for the main analysis, while performing the ROI selection on the other half of the trials. Sacrificing half of the data to minimize the risk of circularity is an admirably choice. Especially in the tSNR limited regime of layer-fMRI. I enthusiastically encourage the publication of this manuscript. If the authors agree, I think they could improve the clarity of the manuscript by adding a few further details of acquisition and analysis. And maybe, they can also add a few additional discussion points about the generalizability of their findings. Itemized below. 1.) I find that the manuscript has a bit of a disconcerting message too. Namely, the authors find that the quantitative (beta-score) layer-profiles are substantially altered when phase-regression is combined with or without NORDIC. This means that the layer-fMRI profiles after phase-regression and after NORDIC-denoising are not reproducible across noise levels of the MRI data. The authors describe this as CNR-dependency in lines 103, 317, 348, 452, 516. This limits the generalizability of the results. It means that the profiles will not be reproducible for slightly different experimental settings (different RF coil, different flip angle, different GRAPPA factor etc.). The authors apply the phase regression for exploratory purposes. And they also show the results without phase regression. Thus, I think they provide a comprehensive and balanced overview in the current manuscript already. If the authors agree, they could add a few sentences in the discussion section about the implications of the CNR dependence for the generalizability of the results. How valuable are de-veining methods if the resulting quantitative profiles are not reproducible across different scanning and noise levels. 2.) I was a bit surprised about the choice of the excitation flip angle of 45 deg. For a 3D-EPI with a (shot-to-shot) TR of 84 ms at 3T, I would have expected the Ernst angle to be less than half of this (approx. 20 deg). All the other parameters including the flip angle of 45 deg are a perfect match with the 3T layer-fMRI Protocol that I have developed in Feb 2020: ( https://github.com/layerfMR... second protocol in pdf). So I think the authors must have used this as a start and retrospectively removed the VASO inversion pulse from the protocol for the purpose of BOLD. Though, the excitation flip angle for a BOLD fMRI time series should be differently optimized than for a VASO inversion-recovery protocol. Thus, I am afraid that the authors did not use a protocol that would have provided the best tSNR for BOLD. I do not think that this disqualifies the conclusions of the paper. I just think that the impressive results could have even been more impressive with a more appropriate excitation flip angle. Maybe the authors want to include a brief discussion about the expected effect of overflipping? E.g. There might be an advantageous effect of suppressing physiological noise of CSF (as discussed here: https://index.mirasmart.com.... Or maybe it’s just a typo? 3.) I was surprised that the analysis pipeline uses a ROI selection criteria that is based on the layer-activation. Described on line 249: :4 the peak signal in depths 0.3-0.4 should not exceed that of depths 0.6-0.8 {...}"". This has the potential to affect the resulting layer-profiles. I appreciate that the authors investigate this potential circularity in supplementary figure S3. They find that this selection criterion is not responsible for the slope modulation with phase regression, by defining the slope solely on upper layers. This solves the issue for me. Though, I am still wondering why the selection criterion was used? Is the reason related to the difficulty to isolate the Brodman area 4a from Brodman area 4p (​​ https://layerfmri.com/findi... Showing the slopes of ROIs that were extracted without this criterion might have been even more convincing in proving that there are no circularity effects. 4.)

The advantage of the authors’ plasmid shuffle experiments is that it allows the study of many mutations and variations of Abf1. The authors reveal that Abf1 possesses an essential motif (EM) as well as several contextual residues that work together to mediate Abf1’s function. Upon further investigation of compositionally and functionally similar IDR’s, the authors hypothesize that sequence specificity and chemical context in IDRs functionally overlap with each other rather than act independently, and propose a 2D model to describe the contributions of each in IDRs. The major success of this paper is in developing a model that reconciles two contributors to IDR function: sequence specificity and chemical context. The major weakness of the paper is that the model is not comprehensively backed with control experiments. The 2D landscape model presented argues that modulation of essential motifs and contextual amino acids can produce several binding modes; however, no data is presented to show that these chimeras are viable because they interact with the same factors or function in the same way that IDR2 does. Therefore, we can’t be certain if these are off-target effects or the same interactions that occur with IDR2 as put forward in the model.  In addition, we found some aspects of the organization of the paper may require more clarity. Overall, the paper reveals some of the functional determinants for Abf1’s IDR and proposes an intriguing model for the functional determinants of other IDRs, but it could be difficult for these findings to be generalized. Major points p.4: It is unclear to us why the minimal viable construct IDR2 449-662 is the background reference construct. Is it possible that IDR1 (absent in this construct) could provide unknown benefits in particular situations? For example, given the unknowns of Abf1’s interactome, is it possible that IDR1 helps to activate transcription of other genes that could rescue IDR2 mutants? Perhaps the presence of IDR1 could confer viability for IDR2 mutants that were deemed not viable in later experiments. Plasmid shuffle assays with IDR2 mutants that also have IDR1 present could be control experiments that answer this question. p.4 The constructs generated in this paper are tested for viability via plasmid shuffle assay, but there is no control experiment to ensure that these constructs are still interacting with the same partners or functioning in the same way that wildtype IDR2 does. One possible control experiment to test this could be to choose an Abf1-interacting partner based on proteomic literature on Abf1, and perform a co-immunoprecipitation/Western blot to see if the partner is still present across different IDR2 mutants. This control experiment should be done with full length Abf1, the background reference construct (with no IDR1), as well as a construct without the EM and a shuffled construct to represent the two extremes of the 2D landscape. p.5: The decision to choose the G4 motif does not have a strong justification or explanation. In figure 3F it is shown from the alignment between Abf1 and Gal4 that the region considered to have sub-homology does not overlap with the essential motif of Abf1 nor does it show similarity in its sequence. Therefore, in our view, it does not appear that Gal4 has an EM that is homologous to the EM of Abf1. Figure S1 PDF: By eye, it appears that there is large variation between the strains considered inviable – for example, FUS_1_163_WT clone 3 on page 6 and Shuffle 3 clones 2 and 3 on page 3 are both marked as inviable yet differ in growth. It could be helpful to readers if an explanation about why a binary classification of viable vs inviable was used in this study, as opposed to a sliding scale quantification. Minor points For a future direction, after identifying the essential motif in IDR2 (EM), we think it would be compelling to go back to the orthologs initially tested to see how conserved the essential motif is evolutionarily and to see how divergent the orthologs that we’re inviable were. We also feel that this could be incorporated into the paper’s discussion. Figure 3: Panels G-K were difficult for us to understand due to the sheer number of constructs presented. To us, the contrast between sequence-specific motif and chemical context would be clearer if panels E and K were combined, perhaps with labels “sequence specificity” and “chemical context” below the respective constructs, to underscore the two ends of the spectrum that these panels represent and to emphasize the unexpected viability of the constructs in K. p.2-3: The hypothesis that poorly conserved IDRs may still retain functional conservation is compelling, but the proteome-wide analysis of disorder leading up to this hypothesis could be clarified in the methods section. In particular, it would be helpful to include an explanation of why and how disorder score from metapredict and predicted pLDDT were used in conjunction with each other, as opposed to using the predicted consensus disorder score from metapredict alone.

However, the authors mention that genetically encoded biosensors (for e.g. cAMP sensors) are rarely used in high-throughput screenings. Probably they have overlooked a recent paper - [(Harkes and Kukk et al., 2021 - Dynamic FRET-FLIM based screening of signal transduction pathways) https://www.nature.com/arti... ]  in which they use an Epac based cAMP FRET sensor with FLIM as the readout and perform high-throughput arrayed siRNA based screen to study the breakdown kinetics of cAMP by the PDEs. Using FLIM as the readout of FRET sensors also circumvents some of the sensor expression level issues that are highlighted in this pre-print. Probably these are some points that the authors would like to take into account when revising their pre-print.",2022-06-13T08:30:22,,Sravasti Mukherjee,10.1101/2022.06.01.494354,Suitable use of FRET-based Biosensors for Quantitative Detection of GPCR Activation,"Nikolaj K.

My first comment is that Waddington was not the first one to propose the existence of distinct cell types, harbouring different functions. My second comment is more of a question: when you are using differentially expressed genes why do you still find no cluster structure? This seems weird to me. By definition of DE genes, they should define clusters. I fully agree that there should be some continuity in between cell types but at the same time tehre should be differences in between cell types.",2022-06-13T08:08:35,oliviergandrillon,Olivier Gandrillon,10.1101/2022.06.03.494765,A lack of distinct cell identities in single-cell measurements: revisiting Waddington’s landscape,"Breanne Sparta, Timothy Hamilton, Serena Hughes, Eric J.

In this response to the correspondence by Hejblum et al. [1], we clarify the reasons why we ran the Wilcoxon rank-sum test on the semi-synthetic RNA-seq samples without normalization, and why we could only run dearseq with its built-in normalization, in our published study [2]. We also argue that no normalization should be performed on the semi-synthetic samples. Hence, for fairer method comparison and using the updated dearseq package by Hejblum et al., we re-run the six differential expression methods (DESeq2, edgeR, limma-voom, dearseq, NOISeq, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) without normalizing the semi-synthetic samples, i.e., under the ""No normalization"" scheme in [1]. Our updated results show that the Wilcoxon rank-sum test is still the best method in terms of false discovery rate (FDR) control and power performance under all settings investigated. References 1.

I have a question for the authors, though. It seems that the theoretical findings on section II of the manuscript might rely on the assumption that the phase relationship between the harmonics (the phi_n) can be considered as phi_n=0 (meaning that all initial phases have the same value). This assumption is implicitly made in the case N=3, and explicitly stated in the case N=infinity, but it seems that it is not clearly justified throughout the text. Thus, it could still be the case that some of the theoretical findings would only be applicable to signals with phi_n=0. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify this issue.

We only saw your message today, but happy to discuss right away! 1. You are right that we did not specify the cervical or thoracic level of the human spinal cord samples in Table S7. The information there is the information that we received from the Netherlands Brain Bank, but I agree that it will be important to include the cervical or thoracic level of each sample. We do have low magnification images that we could also include in the revised version of the paper. I can share them with you before that and it will be great to hear a second, expert option on what cervical or thoracic level they belong to. 2. Thanks for bringing up those intriguing Cnr1-expressing ependymal cells in the rat spinal cord. I had a look in our integrated dataset (10x and Smart-seq2 datasets from 3-month-old mice) and found 19 cells expressing Cnr1 (0.68% of the cells). Most of them localise to the immature lateral cell clusters (activated or not). This is strikingly similar to the numbers that you found in the rat by immunofluorescence. Also in line with your findings, the percentage of Cnr1-expressing cells does not seem to change much with age (0.63% of ependymal cells express Cnr1 in the 10x dataset from aged mice). It is difficult to tell you more about Cnr1-expressing cells because of how very rare they are. I am planning to integrate our dataset with other datasets including spinal cord ependymal cell transcriptomes as they become publicly available to increase cell numbers and get even further with the downstream analysis (e.g clustering, differential expression analysis). I will keep Cnr1-expressing cells in mind, and keep in touch! :) Thanks again for taking the time to comment on our preprint. I look forward to continuing the discussion!

Indeed, because of the century long misleading view about the nature of viruses, in which viruses have been conceptually misidentified with the virus particles and erroneously defined based on their physical, biochemical and biological properties of these particles, the hypotheses about the evolutionary origin of viruses focus on the viral particles. As eloquently described by Salvador Luria and James Darnell in their seminal book General Virology, this conceptual constraint affects in particular the reductive hypothesis: "" The strongest argument against the regressive origin of viruses from cellular parasites is the non-cellular organization of viruses. The viral capsids are morphogenetically analogous to cellular organelles made up of protein subunits, such as bacterial flagella, actin filaments, and the like, and not to cellular membranes…. This theory today has little to recommend it, at least in its original form"" (from Ref. 12 in the Comment above). The Fusion Hypothesis circumvents this conceptual constraint and radically changes our view about the origin of viruses as well as their evolutionary trajectories and impact on the evolution of cellular lineages. If the ancestors of Borgs were indeed symbiotic/parasitic archaeal lineages that fused with their archaeal hosts and evolved as viral lineages, then, their genes, currently assumed to have been assimilated from their host cells, derived from the genes of their archaeal ancestors. In that case, the “Borgs” might be in need for a name adjustment; after all, they are just viruses living in their special environment, an archaeal host cell, which in long term can sustain their reductive evolution and diversification.",2022-05-31T15:01:32,disqus_k5QlD896Ld,Claudiu Bandea,10.1101/2021.07.10.451761,Borgs are giant extrachromosomal elements with the potential to augment methane oxidation,"Basem Al-Shayeb, Marie C.

Previous work from these authors established that NGF is important for the reinnervation of injured bone tissue. Here, they explore a secondary effect of NGF on mesenchymal cell migration that appears to be mediated by NGF’s low-affinity receptor p75. Using a variety of genetic techniques, the authors demonstrate that NGF promotes stromal cell migration in vitro, and that knockout of p75 in vivo slows bone repair. Further, p75 appears to control the expression of genes associated with cell migration. Thus, in addition to its role in bone reinnervation, NGF may act via p75 to promote stromal cell migration during bone repair. Major successes: The major success of the paper is a clear and well established connection between p75-NGF signaling and an effect on mesenchymal cell migration in mice. Also established is the importance of p75 for other processes, such as NGF production in macrophages and ossification of stromal cells. Major Weaknesses: The authors do not establish whether the effects of p75 knockout are independent of other NGF signaling pathways, such as the Trk family of NGF receptors. Thus, it is difficult to determine the relative importance of p75 versus Trk signaling in many of their experiments. Impact : This paper is the first to describe the dependence of calvarial bone repair on p75 signaling. This finding could have important clinical implications for treating bone injuries. Major Points: -A description of review committees overseeing the use of human samples for the research presented in this paper should be included. -Much of the paper relies on understanding the genetic tools, particularly transgenic mouse lines. There is no explanation in the text of what many of these transgenic lines are or what the abbreviations/notation used for them mean (e.g. NgfLysM). Interpretation of the results would be made easier if the authors included one-sentence descriptions of each of these tools and the logic behind using them. The genetics should also be added to the figures when they are critical to the experiment (e.g. a diagram of how the Cre-ER system works in figure 2). -In other contexts, p75 plays a modulatory role in neurotrophin signaling through its influence on other receptor pathways (e.g. Trks). The authors did not test here whether the effects of p75 knockout were via independent functional consequences of the p75 pathway, or relied on modulatory influences over other neurotrophin receptor pathways. For example, the results shown in figure 1 could be largely the result of TrkA signaling, with only partial dependence on p75. The additional finding that p75 knockout reduces overall NGF expression by macrophages (Fig 5) also further complicates the interpretation of many of the in vivo results. To address these complications, the authors could test whether p75 deletion from stromal cells influences the function of other neurotrophin receptors. This can be accomplished by using Trk inhibitors in conjunction with the p75 knockout/knockdown (these authors have demonstrated the ability to use such tools in their previous paper). This is an important experiment because it would determine whether the influence of NGF on p75 can be studied independently of its role in promoting reinnervation via Trk signaling, or if the two phenomena are better examined in relation to each other. -The authors’ should acknowledge additional caveats of their data from human cells/tissue. An important role for p75 in human cell migration is demonstrated in vitro, but it is not fully established in vivo. The observation that p75 is expressed during human bone injury does not alone indicate its function in vivo. Further, the human samples used were taken from tibia and ribs, whereas the rest of the paper is focused on calvarial bone repair. The authors should address these caveats and adjust the sentence beginning on line 261 to better reflect the full range of possibilities. -The paper emphasizes a role for p75 in cell migration. However, it is also clear that p75 likely influences a range of cellular functions beyond cell migration as well. For example,   RNA-seq experiments revealed a wide range of genes whose expression changed following p75 knockouts. Functions relating to NGF translation in macrophages were also likely impaired. These findings suggest that p75 may be critical to a broad range of cellular processes during injury repair, rather than just migration. Devoting more text to the discussion of p75’s role beyond just coordinating cell migration may broaden interest in this paper beyond its current scope. -The authors should include further details about calvarial defect procedures. Specifically, the authors should elaborate on why they choose this injury model over other available models that could recreate common fractures that skulls experience (e.g. of possible reasons: convenience for observations or less pain for animals). At a minimum, the authors should state a reason why they choose this injury model for their studies. This discussion could best fit in the Materials and Methods. Minor Points: -The number of observations appears to be underpowered for some experiments. Particularly, the results in Figs. 2K and 4C look to be trending towards significance, but include small sample sizes. A power analysis for these data, or increasing the number of observations per sample for these experiments, would strengthen the authors’ interpretations of the data. -The authors state the macrophage populations show a minor shift in population distribution based on the single cell data, but their IF shows significant differences in the number of macrophages at the injury site in the p75fl/fl and p75PDGFRa mice. An explanation for this discrepancy should be included. -The data in figure 5 demonstrate that p75 knockout depletes NGF expression in macrophages. This suggests a positive feedback loop between NGF expression and NGF signaling. The authors should explore the consequences of this finding in their discussion as it may be important for considering the interaction between p75 and Trk signaling during bone repair in vivo. -The authors should consider testing tissue samples for the presence of osteoclasts, due to the hypothesis that these cells could modulate the activity of osteoblasts. Generating this data would reinforce Figure 2 and the argument that p75 deletion is driving the lack of bone repair.Alternatively, the authors could discuss how osteoclasts modulate the osteoblast activity they describe through the presented data. This topic could be addressed in the Discussion section, for example as either a study limitations or future projections of this project. -The authors  should consider generating new images for Figure 2 panel I, and see if they can observe osteoblasts in the fracture healing area, using a higher magnification. This could reinforce the comparison among the two conditions presented by demonstrating the presence and hence participation of osteoblasts in the fracture healing process. Stylistic Points: -The order of the figures is a bit confusing. The authors switch back and forth between in vitro and in vivo experiments. One possible order is: Fig 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6. -Typo on line 77: “microdissection bone defect site”. -Reorganize Figures 1 H and I as Figures 1 B and C; they validate the model, and it may help readers accept the model before reporting any further data. -Each chart should have its own legend. Although the color coding is clear, this will help each graph to stand independently from each other and help readers interpret the data quickly. -Remove “squares” from the test in the Materials and Method section, or substitute with any possible missing symbol.

The four-gene phylogeny is robust and shows clearly that one subgenome of Zea-Tripsacum is closely related to Urelytrum and Vossia.
