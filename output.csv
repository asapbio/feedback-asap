We collectively agreed it's a stimulating contribution to understanding how individual specialization emerges and is maintained in natural populations. Most of the literature on the causes of individual specialization focuses on the ecological (i.e., extrinsic) causes of this phenomenon (sensu Araújo et al. 2011 Ecology Letters), while the proximate causes (e.g., functional trade-offs, social status) have surprisingly been little studied. Part of this discrepancy is due to the challenges of testing whether and how individuals' intrinsic traits influence their trophic preferences. This preprint adds a novel level of complexity to the field by quantifying (i) the relative contribution of largely overlooked proximate causes (social learning, maternal effects, genetic factors) and (ii) the simultaneous effects of ecological (i.e., environment context) and proximate causes. We were positively impressed by the quality of the data and statistical analyses during our discussion. The resolution and temporal extent of the data used are unprecedented in the literature, and the Bayesian framework implemented is thorough. As we appreciated the quantitative approaches, our discussion focused mainly on how the question is motivated in the introduction and the major implications of the results. We agreed that the introduction outlines well how the measured factors are expected to drive individual heterogeneity. Still, a more general framing of the research questions could make the manuscript more appealing to a broader and more diverse readership. For instance, the introduction begins by explaining that environmental factors are key drivers of trophic niche variation. However, unraveling how individuality emerges in natural systems, by nature and/or nurture, is a general question that is still widely open in different areas of science - and we believe this manuscript provides exciting results in this regard. In the discussion, the fact that maternal learning, maternal effect, and environment combined explain most of the variance in trophic position (lines 297-299) could be further explored to emphasize the importance of simultaneously studying proximate and ecological causes of individual specialization. Also, the sizable residual observed in the ""Maternal learning"" model suggests that understanding what generates trophic diversity within populations is far more complex than initially thought, particularly in species with complex social structures, creating a stimulating challenge for future studies.

HTT depletion clearly induces a re-location (not a mis-location-since drebrin can locate to filopodia) from the T-zone to filopodia.  Unsurprisingly, given that the drebrin/EB3/Cdk5 pathway enables the capture of dynamic microtubules by filopodia, this is associated with a striking increase in microtubules in filopodia-actually the most significant change you measured in HTT-depleted growth cones.  Drebrin in the T-zone is largely unphosphorylated at S142 and therefore in the folded conformation, which can bind anti-parallel F-actin through one of its two F-actin binding sites.  In contrast, drebrin in filopodia is phosphorylated at S142 and therefore in the open conformation, enabling it to bind to parallel F-actin bundles using both F-actin binding sites.  Drebrin can cross-link F-actin to dynamic microtubules by binding to EB3 in filopodia.  Another manipulation that re-locates drebrin (our unpublished observations) and myosin IIB from the T-zone to filopodia is the inhibition of myosin II by blebbistatin, which essentially disassembles the F-actin in the T-zone removing an impediment to microtubule advance into the P-domain (Hur et al., 2011, P.N.A.S. 108, 5057-5062; Shin et al., 2014, PLoS ONE 9(4): e95212. doi:10.1371; Dupraz et al., 2019, Current Biology 29, 3874–3886).  I wonder, therefore, whether HTT depletion also disrupts the T-zone thereby disabling drebrin binding and unhampering microtubule advance.",2023-09-12T12:02:55,phillipgordonweeks,Phillip Gordon-Weeks,,,,

The principle is to embed both the states (graph nodes) and the actions (graph edges) in the same high-dimensional space, such that the graph distances are represented by geometric distances between nodes, and the actions correspond to directions in the space. Then the agent can pursue the shortest route by choosing the action that points in the direction of the target node. The embeddings of both states and actions are learned during random exploration of the graph, based on optimizing a prediction of the next state from the previous state and action. Ultimately the embedding should be such that the next state can be predicted by simply adding the action vector to the previous state. The authors argue that all this can be accomplished with biologically plausible learning rules. Evaluation This is an interesting suggestion for how an agent might learn the structure of its environment, namely how states and actions are connected. This ultimately results in a goal signal, by which the correct action can be chosen that leads to the goal in the shortest amount of time. Some of my questions concern whether the algorithms are really neuromorphic, in the sense that they could be implemented in biological neural circuits. Concerns about bio-plausibility: 1. The learning rule for state-action association, Eqns 2 and 3: This looks difficult to implement with neurons, because: a) it involves two different time points on the post-synaptic side: s_{t+1} appears at time t+1, but \hat s_{t+1} at time t; b) to make s_{t+1} appear in that neural population, the action vector must temporarily be switched off, requiring some kind of control system; c) the postsynaptic variable is a difference between two successive time points. It is not obvious how to implement such a delta rule with biophysics. 2. The computation of utility, Eqn 4: Again, how would this be implemented with neurons? a) It involves multiplying a population vector with another vector in the same population; what would be the mechanism for such a multiply-and-add operation? b) In the left term, the activity is driven by an action; in the right term, activity of the same neurons is driven by observations. How would that be accomplished? c) The right term involves subtracting activity from the current observations from activity driven by some remembered observation. How are the remembered observations stored? Are these fed into the network one after another? How are they subtracted? 3. Normalization of synaptic weights a) Eqn 5: Here each input synapse gets modified by a factor that depends on the strengths of all the other synapses onto that same neuron. This violates the locality of synaptic plasticity: A synapse should be modified based only on its own strength and the activity of the pre-and postsynaptic neurons. b) Another related normalization appears in line 660. 4. Winner-take-all choice (Eqn 7): Explain how this would work in a neuromorphic system? How does the agent sample the values of the affordable actions? By actually executing them in the real world one at a time and comparing the resulting output from Eqn 4? But then the observations o_t would change as all the actions are played out. Or is the comparison done “mentally” without real-world action? If so, does this require some accessory system that can look up the codes of all the affordable actions and feed them into the network one at a time? In summary, if the authors advocate that this model could be implemented in brains, it would be helpful if the proposal included a bio-plausible neural circuit for each of these operations. Other questions: 5. Graphs with cycles a) As pointed out (p.9), the theory behind this learning model causes problems with cyclic graphs. All the graph edges are supposed to be orthogonal in the embedding space, yet adding the edges around a loop should give zero. Both can’t be true. It is not clear how this conflict was resolved. Does it require careful parameter tuning so as to sustain performance of the model? b) Line 585 describes a hack by which the agent was prevented from traveling cycles during exploration. That requires oracular knowledge of the graph. How would that work in a real-world system? 6. The concept of “action” a) In the first part of the paper (p.1-12), every edge on the graph is considered a different action, and they are all encoded with one-hot vectors. For example, a robot action like “turn left” would have a different one-hot code at every different location. This is somewhat different from the common concept of “action”, which is specific to the agent’s movements, not where they are executed. By postulating a one-hot code for every edge on the graph one effectively circumvents the problem of path integration, which requires making a prediction from stringing together actions that may appear identical from the agent’s perspective. b) Please explain how a naive agent entering a new environment will already have a one-hot code for every edge on the graph, even if they involve identical movements of the agent. c) What if the actions instead were agent-centered, e.g. {left, right, forward, back} as in the second part of the paper (p.13ff). Would the system still be able to learn an arbitrary graph? 7. “Affordances” a) What is the source of the “affordances” in Eqn 6. They represent part of the graph structure. Don’t these need to be learned as well? In the present formulation it seems they are offered to the system without learning (contra line 194). b) By what mechanism would this happen in a neuromorphic system, and how would they be represented by the neural circuit? c) Figure 4e highlights the fact that the agent takes an action that was never taken during exploration (Fig 4c). But what if there was a wall between those two nodes, and that’s why the action never occurred there? How does the agent know that the action is “affordable”. 8. Parameter sensitivity a) It appears that for each of the illustrated graphs the embedding space had a different dimensionality, and different choices were made for the learning rates (p.22). In line 610, the state space has fewer dimensions than the number of actions, which obviously precludes finding orthogonal vectors. What motivated all these different choices? b) How robust is the system to the relevant parameters? Can the same agent with one parameter set learn different spaces? The report would benefit from exploring a wider range of graphs and scanning over parameter values. 9. Related work There is prior research on these topics that could be used to put the current work in context. In particular, various versions of model-based reinforcement learning acquire the structure of the state space through learning, so that a goal-directed policy can be superposed on that. The present paper only deals with learning the state space, not with learning the goal locations: Those are provided by some unspecified accessory system. Within the RL literature there has been recent enthusiasm about the ""successor representation”, which is an embedding that helps predict the agent’s next state. For neuromorphic models that learn the successor representation, see for example Fang 2023 ( https://doi.org/10.7554/eLi... and literature cited there. Other suggestions: 10. There is frequent reference to “planning”. But the model presented here doesn’t make any plans. Once it arrives at a node it decides on the next action, as though it had a lookup table (see line 13). It does not “think ahead”. In the neuroscience and robotics field, “planning” usually concerns evaluating the outcome of successive actions ahead of time, for example comparing the value of different routes. The behavior implemented here is more like “online navigation”. This may be confusing to the reader. 11. In Figures 4 and 5, is there a meaning to the emojis painted on the nodes? At least this reader finds them distracting. Preceding figures worked just fine without emojis. 12. In part 2 (p.13ff) the main difference from part 1 is that the actions are now agent-centric. It may help the reader to point this out. Because there are only 4 action vectors, the predictions are forced into a 4-dimensional subspace of the high-dimensional space. Eventually, the learning process squeezes that into a 2-dimensional subspace that accurately reproduces the geometry of the graph. 13. Eqn 4: should start with u_t= 14. Figure 6c: Perhaps show a bit more of the time course to document that the two variables have settled. 15. Fig 2 caption: “square root of the length of the shortest path” should this be “square root of the sum of squares along the shortest path”. As stated, it doesn’t resemble the law of Pythagoras. 16. Fig 4a: use different arrows for the 4 actions. 17. Typos: Line 68 Line 32 Line 250: Meaning of this sentence unclear.

In this manuscript, Qian and colleagues conduct an extensive study on the identification, classification, and investigation of transposable elements (TEs) and ncRNAs in the genome of Blumeria hordei, a powdery mildew fungal pathogen of Hordeum vulgare (Barley). This is a highly interesting manuscript; the methods are well-documented in the literature, and the results are significant. In my opinion, the authors could provide more information in the Introduction about the infection cycle of B. hordei, as understanding this pathogenic process is crucial for interpreting the presented results. Additionally, here are some specific comments regarding questions and corrections that seemed pertinent to me during my reading. Specific comments: Lines 135-136: The presentation of PC and NMDS analyses is confusing in terms of result interpretation because they do not complement each other, as mentioned in the text. How do the NMDS results influence the interpretation of the PCA results? Lines 172-173: For the 102 TEs, where is the expression data? Lines 181-183: How did you identify if they are peptide-coding transcripts, and what criteria were used to evaluate their significance? Figures 3B and C are not mentioned in the text. Figure 3D should be reversed in terms of read mappings to follow the order of citation in the text (RNA-Seq and ONT), or the text could be modified to maintain the order of appearance in the figure. Lines 203-204: There seems to be a missing punctuation mark in the text. Line 208: Although Figure 4 is mentioned to display information about the lncRNAs identified in the study (such as exon numbers and size), it might be better to specify in which section of Figure 4 this information can be found, e.g., Figure 4B-C.

A main target of antibiotics is the bacterial ribosome. To address the problem of antibiotic resistance in the clinic, Mesa et. al. isolated different Pseudomonas aeruginosa’s strains from cystic fibrosis patients over 8 years that displayed resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. They conducted genomic sequencing and discovered these isolates contain a 12 nucleotide deletion in the rpflF gene that encodes the universal large subunit ribosomal protein 6 (uL6). This mutation has previously been reported in the paper by Halfon et al. (2019) which includes the structural comparison between the mutant and wild type ribosome. In this manuscript the authors determined “~86 ribosomal structures” structures of mutant and wild-type ribosomes with different antibiotics using single particle cryoEM to understand how resistance develops in these mutants. Their main results indicated the uL6 mutation rewires the ribosome conformational landscape and displays resistance to aminoglycosides. Their study confirmed canonical binding sites for aminoglycosides, but new binding sites were discovered for tobramycin in the uL6 mutants. Most importantly, the uL6 mutants displayed a tradeoff between aminoglycoside resistance and chloramphenicol sensitivity, dubbed as collateral sensitivity. In summary, this article provided an in depth structural analysis of antibiotics complexed with the ribosome from clinically relevant antibiotic resistant bacteria, however, there are a few major and minor concerns that we would like the authors to address. Major points. Would it be possible to structurally rationalize why uL6 is more ordered in closed conformation of ribosome and not in the open conformation in case of the mutant? and the same for with and without antibiotics? Would it be possible to make a 1:1 comparison between the uL6 densities in mutant and wildtype datasets for different classes? In the current version of the manuscript we couldn’t see a figure showing the uL6 density in wild-type datasets except in Ro1 class. Could the authors observe any density for uL6 in reconstructions from RC, RT and RK datasets and how does it differ (or not) from the respective mutant classes? (Note: it is difficult to interpret whether uL6 is well ordered or not from supplementary figure S4) How is H69 affected by the uL6 mutation? What are the structural features that connect these two which can prove that the retracted and stretched conformations of H69 are a cause of uL6 apart from the fact that they only exist in the L6M dataset? Could you explain this for example, by looking at the interactions that connect H69 and uL6 mutation region in WT structure? In Fig3B-I, where uL6 is shown to act like a wrist band, it is unclear how the allostery actually manifests structurally. We don’t really have a specific interaction map for R vs L ribosomes such that we can get to know how the interactions are altered in L which then leads to AGA inhibition/CHL sensitivity. Having something like a chord plot showing key interactions that regulate allostery and then highlighting specific interactions that are affected in L ribosome datasets will help. The authors termed a specific part of the 23S rRNA as “50S vulnerable region” because they could see that there was an increase in the flexibility of this region. It is unclear how this flexibility was quantified and what the reference was in quantifying it (i.e. it is flexible in comparison to what?). It is also a bit confusing where exactly this region is located since figure 2F is quite cluttered. There can be two figures, one showing the r proteins and the other just showing the vulnerable region. It would be useful if the authors could highlight the PTC in figure 2F since the proximity of “50S vulnerable region” to PTC is not very obvious. For example H95 which is part of SRL, lies ~60-65Å away from the PTC. The authors use Ro1 structure as a reference even for analysis of L6M datasets. The reason stated for this selection is that it represents the most abundant class of apo R ribosome and that it is the extreme opposite in terms of both antibiotics bound and presence of uL6 mutation. Although this is true, we feel Lo1 is still probably the “true reference” for the L6M datasets because all the structures bound to the antibiotics have the uL6 mutation. And so it would still be useful to look at the differences between Ro1 and Lo1 followed by re-running the analysis by using Lo1 as a reference instead of Ro1. To improve the overall analysis, the authors should consider combining all data sets and process it as a single dataset so as to obtain a more coherent understanding of the structural changes. This would provide a clearer representation of the latent space and the population differences. CryoDRGN generated maps should then be compared to assess if the conformational distribution is still similar to what has been obtained in the current version of the manuscript. This would be helpful in addressing the potential for generating maps based just on the latent space, focusing on the characteristics that differentiate different states and potentially revealing previously unseen conformational states. We feel that the musical analogy in figure 7E forms a cryptic model because A) It requires an inherent understanding of musical terminologies which is not ideal, and B) We are not sure what the authors exactly mean by retuning and detuning of the conformational landscape as R, L, LK, LT have different conformational landscapes, but the authors assign these to notes that are in ‘harmony’ as explained in the discussion (section titled “the well-temepred ribosome”) which is confusing. Another point regarding the musical analogy is that the terms ‘in-tune’ and ‘out of tune’ should be with reference to a specific property. In principle, it should be based on the conformational landscape but that doesn’t hold true as mentioned above. If this is in reference only to the growth curves, then it means that the structural results haven’t been addressed in the final model. We therefore feel that the authors should come up with a simpler model that is easier to understand and yet includes the results from structures. The authors include the paper by Halfon et al. (2019) in their list of references (23), but perhaps should also include a bit more on the discoveries of that paper and what the unresolved questions were motivating this paper in the introduction. Minor points. There may be a typo about universally conserved nucleotides in the decoding center between E. coli vs P. aeruginosa. (on page 9, line “...the universally E.coli conserved nucleotides A1486 and A1487…” these are supposed to be A1492 and A1493 for E.coli and A1486 and A1487 for P.aeruginosa.) When the term “allosteric activator” is used (in the abstract), it should refer to a series of correlated structural changes due to binding of Tobramycin. This is not explained in the paper. How can we say that the existence of 5 binding sites is a result of “allosteric activation” when there is no explanation about how the different binding sites structurally affect each other (even 2 out of 5)? The color coding for the two antibiotics (T/K - red and CHL - gray) can be seen in the legend but not in figure 7b, . Here, we see the distributions for WT and L6M dataset but not for the datasets with the two antibiotics. Do they superimpose? In figure 4a, please define the color coding in the legend for uL6. Figure citation missing on page 9 (“..the sharp kink observed in the retracted H69 helix eliminates the interactions with h44.”). We are not sure why the LT conformational space is larger than L in Figure 7D because the L dataset clearly had more heterogeneity. Could the authors explain this? The distribution figures presented in the paper could be streamlined to convey the main points more effectively. The authors should clarify the meaning of the left and right distributions, as well as their percentages based on total particles. Considering the potential differences in the data set, displaying the particle distribution on a logarithmic scale could provide a more accurate representation. - Tushar Raskar, Mohamad Dandan and James Fraser",2023-09-10T02:32:25,tushar_r,Tushar R.,,,,

This review resulted from the graduate-level course ""How to Read and Evaluate Scientific Papers and Preprints"" from the University of São Paulo, which aimed to provide students with the opportunity to review scientific articles, develop critical and constructive discussions on the endless frontiers of knowledge, and understand the peer review process. In this preprint Veryard et al. points out that for the past 25 years, ecological research has shown that biodiversity positively impacts ecosystem functions like biomass production when other variables are constant. Earlier experiments focused on grassland plant communities, but newer ones indicate similar benefits in plantations and forests. There's been limited research in tropical environments. This study presents preliminary results from a field-scale experiment in southeast Asia, examining the role of tree species diversity in restoring lowland tropical rainforests. Findings from Sabah, Malaysian Borneo suggest that active restoration, such as tree planting, accelerates forest recovery. This recovery is even more pronounced when using a diverse mix of tree species. The Sabah Biodiversity Experiment, conducted in the Malua forest reserve, involves different restoration methods on 500 ha of logged tropical forest. Observations reveal that the restoration is most effective when a diverse set of tree species is used for replanting. The study supports the idea that the positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning seen in other ecosystems also exists in SE Asia's lowland tropical rainforests. The data are reported in a clear way and the manuscript is well written. Data are consistent with the currently existing literature. Comments ●	About the soil preparation or pre-planting methods, it was highlighted that in one of the treatments the removal of lianas was used. Therefore, it would be interesting to highlight whether controls such as leaf-cutting ants, termites and weeds, fertilization methods and soil correction methods were used or not, even as standard for all treatments. ●	Perhaps the objective of the experiment was not to identify the diversity of species more than 10 years after planting, but considering that there was a survey of data in the field to compare the information from the satellite analysis, it would be interesting to obtain such information to also show that species diversity still exists in the places, since this is also a relevant indicator to consider areas as restored. In addition, this indicator can help to identify potentially monodominant species or even to identify the optimal number of species to be planted to maintain a desired final diversity. ●	It would also be important to highlight in the text the density of individuals planted per area, to reinforce that the increase in the indexes analyzed originated to the diversity of species and not just to a large density of individuals planted per area.",2023-09-06T14:50:01,jefersonlealsilva,Jeferson Leal Silva,,,,

By the expression of the following differential biomarkers, these populations can be divided into two: melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), cocaine, and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART); and orexin, oxytocin, and vasopressin. Excitotoxicity is commonly seen in the population of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum and is the main cause of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease. On the other hand, the nature of the neurodegenerative process found in the hypothalamus remains unknown. Thus, the author's objective was to evaluate the relationship of quinolinic acid (QA)-mediated excitotoxicity in the hypothalamic regions of wild-type and transgenic HD mouse models. Below are my comments about the work: I would like to suggest the authors to remove the term “fatal” or replace it with “progressive” in the abstract and introduction. The fatality, or lethality, results from the knockout of the huntingtin gene ( https://doi.org/10.1242/dev..., while greater numbers of CAG repetition relative to huntingtin’s mutation and homozygote allele are related to early manifestations of symptoms and several clinical courses, respectively ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/W... https://doi.org/10.1093/bra.... In the introduction, I suggest the authors to modify the phrase “Excitotoxicity, i.e., excessive stimulation of the glutamate receptor, …”, as it is glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. This is because excitotoxicity can be conceptualized as cytotoxicity caused by increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations (DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.13-05-02085.1993). Therefore, excitotoxicity can be glutamate-dependent and -independent. We can also observe excitotoxicity when calcium concentrations increase by other pathways that are independent of glutamate receptors. In both cases, there will be a loss of the cell's ability to reestablish the homeostatic balance of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0903546106). In the conclusion topic, I think that could be interesting to further exploring the data obtained from selective excitotoxicity for the MCH-positive neurons. I say this because, although there is no amplification of the QA-induced excitotoxicity effect in the transgenic animals, the observation that the same neurons (i.e., the MCH-positive neurons) naturally undergo neurodegeneration seems to me an indication that the affected neuronal populations can die by different mechanisms; being, however, the MCH-positive neuronal cell death, probably, related to the glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. Thus, the hypothesis that the MCH-positive neuronal population is selectively affected by the glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity cannot be ruled out.",2023-09-05T17:39:31,lucasbonfimmarques,Lucas Bonfim Marques,,,,

The study ""Pain reflects the informational value of nociceptive inputs"" by Michel-Pierre Coll et al. examines the potentiality for the central nervous system to optimize pain’s learning function by being modulated by pain perception. Moreover, the author's hypothesized that nociceptive processing could be augmented when pain is surprising to facilitate predictive learning about pain. To see if this occurs, the authors record nociceptive flexion reflex amplitude combined with electroencephalography to link nociceptive flexion reflex modulation with the influx of ascending nociceptive signals to the cortex. On the electroencephalography they use two indices of expected pain. The first is the late positive potential (peaks around 400-600 ms after the pain-predictive cue). The second is a decrease of oscillatory power in the alpha and beta bands. This seems to be a very powerful take on how pain learning is associated with the expectation of pain. And the combinations of different methods of recording the perception of pain is a novelty in this area, combining the recording of nociceptive flexion reflex modulation amplitude with electroencephalography to link the modulation with the influx of ascending nociceptive information to the cortex. That way the authors can distinguish between the nociceptive responses and perception of pain in the participants and that the predictions errors between anticipated predictions and actual outcomes are associated with the nociceptive flexion reflex. The procedure of the experiment is very well delineated and explained in the text. The statistical analysis is very well explained and appropriate for the problem in hand. Then again, the authors did not specify why they use the three computational models that they choose to use. Although those three computational models are frequently used in studies about uncertainty in perception takes in volatile environments, the justification for their uses are intrinsically different. The justification for the use of a computational model must be a priori unless the study is about the models themselves. All that said, the interpretation for the basis why the Rescorla-Wagner model provided a better fit for the data is very good. Maintaining the environmental volatility relatively high and constant throughout the task due to the regular introduction of new cues is a very good way of simulating actual environmental conditions. Also, they did not say why they used thirty-five participants. Is always recommended to do a pilot to calculate effect and sample size or to justify this quantity from the literature or previous works from the group, published or not. It is argued that this is good enough to reach meaningful conclusions in this specific case. A limitation of this study is the dependence on the connection of the electroencephalography markers used for pain processing to aversive prediction errors that still don't have strong evidence in the literature. The authors make that clear in the text. Meanwhile, combining electroencephalography with functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional near-infrared spectroscopy may give more insights and give more evidence on pain processing to aversive prediction. The results of prediction errors being associated with increased pain perception and physiological pain responses and also with increased anticipatory cortical responses shows that this study is well done and very promising reliability and validity.",2023-09-01T16:20:46,disqus_IhM3mGPyfe,Bernard Costa,,,,

Indeed, current pipelines of defensome analysis (DefenseFinder, Padloc) do not provide sufficient HMMs representative of the large diversity of these systems. They currently mainly focus on PsyrTA, RosmerTA, SanaTA and ShosTA with proven antiphage activity, and argue that ""Toxin-Antitoxin have not been included yet, as there is still some controversy if all members of such families are involved in anti-phage defense"". While the latter is true, there is currently in my view room for the inclusion of more families. Personally, I think that one of the reasons on why this has been delayed, relates partially to the high turnover and dN/dS of several TA genes, which makes it more tricky to build strong HMM models. The latter is something in which our group is actively working at for the eventual release of future analysis tools. In the case of this paper we have stated that our analyses are clearly underestimating the abundance of defense families (for reasons that are highlighted in the Discussion section), but we will definitely make sure to highlight the particular point of TAs (adding appropriate references).

We also thank you for citing three papers from our group. However, I am leaving this comment because our papers were not adequately nor accurately cited in your manuscript. First, we have already shown that asymmetric tension decides a budding direction in J Phys Chem B 126 (2022): 453-462 using our simulations. This is consistent with your findings, and none of your text mentioned this. Second, we have already carried out a large-scale coarse-grained simulation of lipid droplet biogenesis with seipin, published in Elife 11 (2022): e75808. This includes not only nucleation but also maturation and budding. We have further found and discussed the critical role of seipin transmembrane segments in maintaining a neck structure. In particular, based on our simulations, we proposed a mutant construct, which was further validated by experiment in our paper. The final structure of our CG molecular dynamics simulations is consistent with the experimental structure.  In that regard, our work has been cited in your paper only for nucleation but did not receive proper credit for budding and maturation. In particular, we disagree with the following two sentences in your manuscript: ""The function of seipin is also not completely clear: simulations and experiments suggested that it may trap triglycerides (13-15), therefore affecting LD nucleation and growth by ripening, but its localization at the LD-ER contact site raises questions on a possible role also in the budding process.” ""LD nucleation and phase separation were observed in simulations before (7,13,22,23,38), and occur on fast time scales (below the microsecond); in contrast, the budding process has never been observed so far, neither in simulations nor experimentally.""

We collectively agreed it’s an exciting contribution to our understanding of how urbanization reshapes bird communities and their traits. During our discussion, a major point of debate was the ability of the Urban Association Index (UAI) to capture fundamental aspects of urban tolerance. The supplementary material explains important details on how this metric was obtained, but a few questions remained after our discussion. In particular, as the number of records has the potential to influence the mean UAI, widespread, very common species – even if they are equally common in cities and rural areas – may exhibit high UAI mean because most of the records from eBird come from urban areas (i.e., sampling bias). In this scenario, UAI may be amplified for abundant and/or eye-catching species. Perhaps the authors could check the correlation between mean UAI and the number of records to see the nature of this relationship. In this same line of thought, it might be opportune to explore how UAI varies across native vs. invasive species. We understand the reasoning for not differentiating native vs. exotic species (lines 114-116), but for species that were recently introduced through pet trade (e.g., Yellow-crested Cockatoo, Monk Parakeet - which are among those with the highest UAI values), not necessarily UAI is measuring tolerance to urbanization, particularly when their native habitats are not represented in the dataset. We also discussed that a possible approach to illuminate the biological meaning of UAI would be looking at the relationship between mean UAI and variance in UAI. Figure S5 shows how variance varies across species, apparently independent from the mean UAI. In this perspective, for instance, species with high UAI and high variance in UAI tend to be highly associated with cities but also occur in non-urban areas. In turn, species with high UAI and low variance in UAI are strict to cities, and so on. Congrats on the manuscript, and good luck with the next steps of this work!

In this preprint, the authors describe and discuss the structure of a Glycerol-3-phosphate Acyltransferase (GPAT) called PlsB. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the authors have successfully elucidated the complete structure of PlsB from Themomonas haemolytica (ThPlsB). The structural study revealed that ThPlsB forms a symmetric homodimer with three distinct domains in each monomer: the amino-terminal domain (NTD), the middle catalytic domain (MCD), and the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). Additionally, the study identified binding sites for a fatty acyl-CoA molecule and a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DOPA) molecule within the MCD of PlsB. It was also demonstrated that interactions between ThPlsB and the cell membrane involves two exposed amphipathic regions on the surface, located in the NTD and MCD. Based on structural and biochemical analyses, the authors propose a model in which PlsB associates with the membrane surface, coupling its catalytic activity to the biosynthesis of lysophosphatidic acid at the interface between the cell membrane and the cytosol. The data and hypotheses are well presented and written clearly and concisely, and it is an excellent piece of work that provides a new and significant perspective on the structure of PlsB. Major comments ● The outcomes are adeptly presented, offering the reader lucid and succinct comprehension. The executed experiments display a high level of proficiency, and the employed controls that were fittingly selected. This informative exploration of PlsB elucidates numerous structural facets of the enzyme. ● This work provides an excellent insight into the importance of the CTD, NTD, and MCD domains and offers an initial understanding of the aspects mediating the enzyme's interaction with the membrane. There are limitations in CryoEM that prevent the study of the protein bound to lipid bilayers, which justifies the use of micelles and the addition of DOPA. However, considering that the association of PlsB with the membrane is essential for its catalytic activity and that the bilayer association potentially could induce structural changes in the enzyme, possibly even in the active site, I believe that the study could be further enriched by incorporating methodologies aimed at analyzing the impacts on the structure and the aforementioned domains resulting from the protein's binding to LUVs lipid bilayers. ● In addition to the points mentioned earlier it would add value to the manuscript the characterization of the enzymatic activity in the presence of lipid bilayers as well. This would allow for the analysis of how the bilayer and its curvature influence the activity of both the wild-type enzyme and the mutants. Minor comments ● To provide a clearer context for introducing PlsY in the introduction, it might be beneficial to offer more explanatory information. The way it's currently presented could potentially confuse the reader. ● Including a figure illustrating the pathway and highlighting the position of PlsB could greatly enhance the reader's comprehension and appreciation of its importance. ● It could be interesting to perform enzymatic assays with acyl-ACP, another substrate of PlsB. ● The figure 6 could be improved in terms of clarity and didactic presentation in order to most adequately convey and summarize the discussed information to the reader.",2023-08-30T14:42:33,samuelguimarescostapereira,Samuel Guimarães Costa Pereira,,,,

We would like to suggest some possible improvements to be considered by the authors in this preprint stage before it becomes published in a journal. In some parts of the manuscript it is said that mRNA buffering is perfect as total mRNA concentration and even individual mRNA concentrations are invariant. We think that this is overblown. For instance, graphs in Sun et al 2013 (ref. #9; Figure 1), the variability in total mRNA may be as high as 50%. In fact, in García-Martínez et al 2004 (ref. #15; Figure 2) we published that during the carbon source change mRNA concentration changes also by a factor of 2. We wonder if this could be important for the modeling because it seems that on the advantages of the RS model is that it predicts robust buffering, contrarily to previous feedback models. The manuscript misses citation of some papers that we consider important for the field of mRNA buffering, such as Mena et al 2017 (doi: 10.1093/nar/gkx974). This paper is especially relevant because the current preprint describes in the Introduction section that total mRNA concentration is constant as the cell volume increases (refs. 19-22) but forgets to mention this piece of work, which was the first one to show that degradation rate perfectly balances production rate during cell volume change. Instead of our paper, the preprint cites ref. #27, which is 4 years older than Mena et al 2017. Garcia-Martinez et al 2023 (doi: 10.1016/j.bbagrm.2023.194910) is also highly relevant. We described in that article a mathematical model that explains mRNA buffering using a simpler mechanism consisting only one mRNA binding factor that co-transcriptionally imprints mRNAs. That model also predicts that synergistic changes in synthesis and degradation rates will provoke faster and stronger responses, as described in some experiments. We also previously published a multiagent model in Begley et al 2019 (10.1093/nar/gkz660), which combines mRNA imprinting and feedback mechanisms. That paper also demonstrates that Ccr4 and Xrn1 act in parallel with different sets of targets genes. We also have demonstrated in that paper and in other two (Begley et al 2021 doi: 10.1080/15476286.2020.1845504; and  Medina et al 2014 doi: 10.3389/fgene.2014.00001) that protein factors, such as Ccr4 and Xrn1 act not only in transcription initiation level but also in elongation . We think it would be nice this manuscript to discuss the differences of these models with the proposed RS model. Finally, as for the model in Figure 4c, we do not understand why the activation of a degron used by Chappleboim et al 2022 (ref. #16) only degrades cytoplasmic Xrn1 molecules (Xc) and leaves Xp molecules intact. All Xrn1-degron molecules (Xc, Xp, Xn) will be proteolyzed after Auxin addition. This can affect the predictions made by the RS model.",2023-08-30T08:41:17,joseeperez,Jose E Perez-Ortin,,,,

By the expression of the following differential biomarkers, these populations can be divided into two: melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), cocaine, and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART); and orexin, oxytocin, and vasopressin. Excitotoxicity is commonly seen in the population of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum and is the main cause of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease. On the other hand, the nature of the neurodegenerative process found in the hypothalamus remains unknown. Thus, the author's objective was to evaluate the relationship of quinolinic acid (QA)-mediated excitotoxicity in the hypothalamic regions of wild-type and transgenic HD mouse models. Below are my comments about the work: I would like to suggest the authors to remove the term “fatal” or replace it with “progressive” in the abstract and introduction. The fatality, or lethality, results from the knockout of the huntingtin gene ( https://doi.org/10.1242/dev..., while greater numbers of CAG repetition relative to huntingtin’s mutation and homozygote allele are related to early manifestations of symptoms and several clinical courses, respectively ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/W... https://doi.org/10.1093/bra.... In the introduction, I suggest the authors to modify the phrase “Excitotoxicity, i.e., excessive stimulation of the glutamate receptor, …”, as it is glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. This is because excitotoxicity can be conceptualized as cytotoxicity caused by increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations (DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.13-05-02085.1993). Therefore, excitotoxicity can be glutamate-dependent and -independent. We can also observe excitotoxicity when calcium concentrations increase by other pathways that are independent of glutamate receptors. In both cases, there will be a loss of the cell's ability to reestablish the homeostatic balance of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0903546106). In the conclusion topic, I think that could be interesting to further exploring the data obtained from selective excitotoxicity for the MCH-positive neurons. I say this because, although there is no amplification of the QA-induced excitotoxicity effect in the transgenic animals, the observation that the same neurons (i.e., the MCH-positive neurons) naturally undergo neurodegeneration seems to me an indication that the affected neuronal populations can die by different mechanisms; being, however, the MCH-positive neuronal cell death, probably, related to the glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. Thus, the hypothesis that the MCH-positive neuronal population is selectively affected by the glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity cannot be ruled out.",2023-08-27T18:57:22,disqus_vBUn9yN5KM,Lucas Bonfim,,,,

We are Felippe Truglio Machado and Rebeca Bueno-Alves, PhD students at the Department of Biochemistry at University of São Paulo. This article does a really good job demonstrating how mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide affects genomic DNA, with a clear and concise methodology. It puts a perspective on how we should address our concepts when we say how mitochondria oxidant production contributes toward nuclear damage, specifying if it’s a direct or indirect one, something that hasn’t been demonstrated yet. The article aimed to analyze whether hydrogen peroxide produced in mitochondria could potentially contribute directly toward nuclear DNA damage, considering the distance this species would have to travel within the cell. A highly interesting methodology for control induced hydrogen peroxide was developed based on the expression of the enzyme D-Amino Acid Oxidase (DAAO) at different sites within human cells. DAAO was anchored to the outer membrane of the mitochondria or to the nucleosomes. This method proved to be quite promising, particularly regarding its use in studies requiring more continuous or compartmentalized exposure to H2O2, as this could better mimic the physiological cell hydrogen peroxide production, instead of an exogenous burst treatment. This approach is useful for a handful of studies, especially for those focused on mitochondrial DNA integrity. Based on the presented results, the researchers were able to conclude that peroxide formed in mitochondria cannot significantly affect nuclear DNA directly, but they do not rule out the possibility of some indirect impact, warranting further studies in this regard. Although this work really is a great contribution to our current knowledge into mechanisms of oxidative nuclear damage, especially regarding the possibility of its use in future studies, it could really benefit from a different approach in some of its statements. Major comments: ●	The discussion but not in the introduction discuss oxidative DNA lesions and repair by the BER pathway. In the topic “mitochondrial H2O2 release does not induce genomic DNA damage” represented by figure 3, it would be great to assess speciafically BER proteins, which are essential for oxidized base repair. Two additional scenarios must be considered in this situation: one in which the BER pathway is synchronized and single strand breaks are being repaired by POLB as soon as they are generated by glycosylases/ape1, therefore, without much of an increase in single strand breaks. The other one in which the repair proteins are oxidized and repair is not initiated, therefore mutagenic lesions such as 8-oxoG would not impair DNA replication, not inducing cell cycle arrest, which would lead to infidelity of DNA replication instead. So, experiments focused on the BER pathway would help to substantiate the results. Suggestions include measuring OGG1, APE1, or PolB, adding them to the western blot data, or even “BER signaling proteins” such as PARP1. With the present data, we know that peroxide production from the nucleus and mitochondria can cause or not cause nuclear DNA damage (DNA strand breaks), but the mutation rate caused by these types of damage and/or by the mutagenic lesions is not determined. In sync with this line of thought, it would also be interesting to detect damage and survival in the cells after a few days to see how the possible mutations could be established and impact on cell physiology. ●	It would be important to have results that can characterize the experimental model established by the group. In the first figure, they show through the measurement of oxygen consumption that the model was effective in generating H2O2 after the addition of D-Alanine, both in the lineage expressing DAAO in the nucleosomes and in the outer mitochondrial membrane. In order to ascertain whether the addition of the DAAO enzyme with or without D-Ala, by itself, could generate an impact on mitochondrial function or non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption, a comprehensive bioenergetic characterization of the model as a whole would be really beneficial This would ensure that the observed changes are attributable to the specific impact of DAAO and not something indirect through changes in oxidative phosphorylation. ●	The paper could be really improved by adding an assessment of mitochondrial DNA. First, it’s important to differentiate the two genomes. Only nuclear DNA damage was measured, so when DNA damage is mentioned it is important to address this limitation. Second, despite having far less coding genes compared to nuclear DNA, mtDNA oxidative damage and mutation should not be excluded from the discussion. Although mt H2O2 could not contribute directly toward tumorigenesis in the nucleus as stated, it could cause mutations in mtDNA, and this could also have detrimental consequences that should be worth mentioning in the discussion. Also, since the model is already available, future studies analyzing controlled mtDNA damage and mutations caused by peroxide would be a great contribution, since mitochondrial dysfunction caused by impaired mitochondrially-encoded protein synthesis has a big impact in a plethora of disorders. The nuclear genome is of course the main character in cancer, but mtDNA should not be excluded regarding its importance in cell metabolism. Experiments such as detecting mtDNA copy number by PCR and measuring oxygen consumption using different mt complex inhibitors would add a lot to this work, and would provide an overview of H2O2 production by D-Amino Acid Oxidase DAAO impact on mitochondria. In the absence of this data, it's challenging to determine whether any alterations are due to impacts on nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. ●	Regarding the cell survival data, a clonogenic assay and a MTT assay could yield interesting insights and complement the crystal violet data presented in Figure 2. The methods used in the article assessed the effect of H2O2 after 24 hours of treatment, but it would be worthwhile to observe their impact over longer periods. Therefore, a clonogenic assay would be quite valuable to reinforce the data and allow for more comprehensive conclusions, and it also would enable to assess cell survival in a quantitative way. The MTT assay could complement this data since it can be used to analyze cell viability in a mitochondrial metabolism dependent way. ●	Regarding cell death induced by ferroptosis, it would be good if mitochondria-mediated cell death (citC/Caspase9) could be measured, and also mitophagy. Since a lot of damage is being generated in mitochondria it would be interesting to see its impact on other cell death mechanisms and mitochondrial degradation. ●	Some minor statements: ○	Figure 3A could be quantified and presented in graphs for better data visualization ○	In figure 4, the treatment time scale could be aligned to the left like the other figures instead of in the middle.",2023-08-25T18:07:39,felippe_truglio_machado,Felippe Truglio Machado,,,,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.04.552078v2#comment-6263319234,biorxivstage,2,"Dear Dr. Germain, Thank you for the insightful comment on our preprint and your important contributions to the singlet detection methodologies. We have considered your response and have addressed your comments below. Comment: First, it's wrong to write that scDblFinder is ""formerly known as doubletCells"". They're two methods developed independently, and it's simply that doubletCells was moved to the same package, but still as an independent method. Response: Thank you for pointing this out. Our confusion stemmed from the fact that doubletCells kept pointing us to the scDblFinder package. Indeed, you are right in that scDblFinder and doubletCells are two different methods. We will revise the manuscript to clarify this point. Comment: Second, your results are in contrast with other benchmarks, which you explain by more ""realistic scRNA-seq datasets"". I'm obviously not entirely disinterested here, but I think this is very misleading: you don't show any evidence that the traditional benchmark datasets do have unrealistic patient or batch effects, and omit to mention the critical fact that, as far as I know, the fatemap samples are homogeneous cell lines, which is far from being more realistic (people do scRNAseq on complex tissues much more often than on cell lines). I think a fairer description would be to abandon the ""realistic/unrealistic"" labels, describe your data as it is, and hence that your observations are basically about homotypic doublets, which the tested methods are very bad at detecting (but also don't claim to do). The lack of real difference between adjacent/distant seems to indicate pretty clearly that you're essentially dealing with homotypic doublets. Response: Thank you for your thorough reading of our preprint and raising these points. First, the point on what are “realistic datasets” is well-taken as it is a subjective descriptor, and, as such, open to interpretation. We will certainly qualify our language appropriately in the revised version; I appreciate you noticing it! Second, homotypic doublets are those from transcriptionally similar cells. As a result, they manifest to different extents or spectrums in both homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets and are a problem regardless of the datasets in question. Third, as a matter of fact, not all FateMap datasets are homogenous. Some of the more heterogeneous datasets are from primary human samples and differentiated cardiomyocytes. Even for those that are homogenous, it is the starting population that is homogenous, not the eventual responses to stimuli/stress, which are quite diverse. Finally, where single-cell sequencing is more useful or implemented is open to interpretation. Of course atlases of diverse tissues and cell types have been useful and continue to be so. Beyond atlases, the continuums of cell identities and rare cell states are of particular interest in a wide-range of biological questions, from cancer to aging to stem cell therapies. We hope the community can use barcoding datasets to study differences which are outwardly subtle, yet can have profound phenotypic impact. Lastly, we do not agree with your statement on “lack of real difference”, as our data clearly shows significant performance improvement for both AUROC and AUPRC for doubletCells (Figure 2E,F). Again, our motivation for testing these methods and showing their lower than reported performance on detecting homotypic doublets is to aid users to choose the method that would work best on their dataset. We thank you for your thorough reading of our preprint, and I am happy to answer any other questions you may have. Feel free to reach me at yogesh.goyal@northwestern.edu.

This work is aimed to explore the conformation preference in LLPS especially at interface by a homopolymer model.

From the single-chain Rg distribution, the homopolymer used in this work would collapse. From polymer field view, this polymer has bad solvent quality with exponent coefficient v<0.5 in dilute phase, but in highly concentrated polymer melt, polymer has solvent quality with exponent coefficient v=0.5, so it will expand when entering polymer melt phase. Also the interface region in your work could be viewed as semi-dilute phase. Your result is similar with what's illustrated in polymer field before. But was it suitable for LLPS? 3.

The manuscript discusses changes in body temperatures of two distinct species of nesting sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea and Eretmochelys imbricata) over a period of seven years. The experimental efforts proved to be sufficient to fulfill the research objective, with emphasis on the use of a non-invasive method, considering that these are threatened species. The manuscript is very well written with a cohesive introduction that offer adequate information allowing the reader to easily follow the discussion of the obtained results. However, two points could be better addressed: i. geographic contextualization could be described with more precision and details, and a map could be helpful for the reader; ii. a more complete discussion about the threat status of both species would be useful to contextualize the relevance of the work. Below are some comments. - Keywords: Despite being a small detail, keywords contain terms already used in the title, which is not necessary. Thus, we suggest changing these keywords: leatherback turtle, hawksbill turtle, core body temperatures, nesting. - Introduction: Addressed pertinent information that was little commented on in articles in the area about the physiology of the leatherback turtle species and its relationship with body temperature, for example, the ability of the species to maintain its body temperature above the average temperature of the ocean. - Introduction: Despite mentioning the imminent risk of extinction of these species due to the increase in average global temperature, the risk of global and local extinction of both species was not mentioned. E. imbricata is known to be critically endangered and D. coriacea is classified as vulnerable worldwield, according to the IUCN. - Study sites: As mentioned, the manuscript would benefit considerably of including a map, and mentioning the state and country of the nesting sites where the samplings took place. It could be also interesting to offer more information on the social context of the islands (e.g. are the islands protected areas? are there residents on the island?). - Measurement of core body temperatures: it would be important to give more details on sampling efforts, for example: frequency and time of monitoring. - Results: it would be interesting to add the variation in body temperature of each species of sea turtle in the result topic, as described in the article abstract, as it is an important information for the reader. - Discussion: It would be interesting to mention other possible oceanographic and climatic influences, in addition to El Niño and La Niña, such as other sea surface temperature anomalies (e.g. Atlantic Dipole).

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.12.553073v1#comment-6260824366,biorxivstage,3,"Reviewed by: Julia Takuno Hespanhol and Stephanie Sibinelli de Sousa This review resulted from the graduate-level course ""How to Read and Evaluate Scientific Papers and Preprints"" from the University of São Paulo, which aimed to provide students with the opportunity to review scientific articles, develop critical and constructive discussions on the endless frontiers of knowledge, and understand the peer review process. In the study titled “Toxinome - The Bacterial Protein Toxin Database”, Danov et al. developed a publicly accessible website compiling the information on bacterial toxins and antitoxins from all available species from five distinct databases (SecRet6, BactiBase, TADB, BAGEL, UniProt). This system offers user-friendly browsing options, enabling users to explore the compiled data by organism or by Pfam code. Additionally, the website incorporates advanced search tools allowing searches based on amino acid sequences or specific keywords like product name, organism name, Pfam ID, and Pfam name. A particularly intriguing observation of the dataset was the identification of ‘Toxin Islands’, genomic regions that encode multiple toxins and/or antitoxins. These Toxin Islands not only provide information about known toxins but also serve as indicators of potential unidentified toxins within these genomic regions. The paper demonstrates the utility of this concept by providing an example where a hypothetical protein encoded within a Toxin Island exhibits structural similarities to a known toxin. Although the creation of the database and website is quite impressive, the compiled information could have been further explored. Major comments 1.	What specific analysis ensures that the domains present in the database truly belong to toxins and are not false positives? A search solely based on the ""toxin/toxic"" word through InterPro might have introduced many false positives. Furthermore, was there a previous quality check for the proteins imported from each database to ensure they were actually toxins? It is possible that false-positive toxins were included from the original datasets. One example is the structural protein Hcp from the T6SS (annotated in the SecReT6) gene id: 2503566284, which is depicted as a toxin, but the predicted protein does not encode any toxic domains. There are several examples of Hcp domain encoding proteins in the dataset that probably present only structural functions. In line 150, ""The resulting dataset was then manually curated for quality assurance, and toxin or antitoxin genes erroneously included were removed”. Could you please elaborate on the procedure of this manual analysis? What specific criteria were employed to identify and eliminate false positives? This information is crucial to ensure the reliability of the identified toxins and antitoxins. 2.	A more comprehensive discussion of the existing databases would greatly enhance the work. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the total number of proteins present in each database and highlight any intersection between them. This additional information will provide a clearer picture of the data's scope and contribute overall credibility of the analysis. 3.	Although the analysis of toxin presence in bacteria living across varying temperature ranges does yield intriguing insights into the evolution of extremophiles, this aspect appears distant from the central topic of the work and offers a relatively superficial analysis. It would also be interesting to include other information: 1) what is the toxin distribution by habitat type and hosts; despite being a well-studied area, this association would lend support to the dataset's intrinsic conclusion; 2) target specificity and protein domains, what is the frequency of toxins targeting specific cellular components (lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, metabolites) based on protein domains (Pfam); 3) what is the toxin diversity among different phylogenetic groups; figure 6 explores this aspect to some extent, however, the toxin types (domains) are not mentioned. 4.	The concept of Toxin Islands is crucial to the study and could be explored more deeply. While Figure 6 focuses on the topic, only the toxin and antitoxin counts are provided. Details about toxin types within each island could be valuable. An observation is highlighted regarding the Bacilli class, whether a higher toxin count than the antitoxin count is observed. The hypothesis in the discussion part suggests that Bacilli may have an abundance of toxins targeting eukaryotes, potentially explaining the lower need for antitoxins. This hypothesis could be further investigated using the Toxinome data itself. 5.	The work uses protein structural prediction tools to examine the specific case of  unannotated toxin and antitoxin found in the Toxin Island of Thauera phenylacetica B4P (Figure 7). It would be beneficial to the work to highlight other examples. Minor comments 1.	Figure 2 appears to be very complex, leading to difficulties in following the numerical sequence. This figure could be separated into Panels A and B. 2.	In Figure 3, consider providing annotations for Archaea species. Additionally, indicate on the phylogenetic tree the specific bacterial clades that have a depletion of toxins and antitoxins. 3.	There is no reference to a figure or table in line 285: ""As we expect, there is a high correlation between toxin and anti-toxin content (R = 0.6581, pvalue = 7.59x10-13)"". 4.	There is no reference to a figure/table/supplementary material to line 143:  ""To increase the number of toxins and  immunity proteins into our database we used protein domain information. We added 219 and 94 toxin and antitoxin domains, respectively, to the resulting toxin gene set that we downloaded from the Pfam database."". 5.	The data present in Tables 1-4 could be effectively visualized using graphs, which would enhance the clarity and comprehension of the information. 6.	In the discussion (line 440): ""For example, certain hyperthermophilic and halophilic Archaea were described to produce bacteriocins called sulfolobicins and halocins, respectively"". It would be interesting to know if the authors could find these toxins in the compiled Toxinome dataset",2023-08-22T17:11:14,,Stephanie Sibinelli,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.14.516395v1#comment-6260609911,biorxivstage,1,"This assessment of a preprint is part of a research evaluation course within my Ph.D. program, in which I was tasked with selecting a preprint manuscript to formulate questions and suggestions for improvement. I was delighted to come across your article, and the experience of reading it has been truly remarkable. It has been a rewarding endeavor to contemplate potential alternatives and novel experiments that could further enhance the significance of your work. I hope that you receive this message and find value in these collaborative insights. The lncRNA Sweetheart regulates compensatory cardiac hypertrophy after myocardial injury. In the elegant study by Rogala et al., they demonstrated that the expression of the long non-coding RNA ""sweetheart RNA"" (Swhtr), which is expressed in the same region as the crucial transcription factor Nkx2-5, exerts favorable effects on both cardiac function and morphology in animals subjected to left anterior descending artery ligation (LAD). The Swhtr lncRNA is chromatin-localized, and although its deletion does not induce cardiac structural changes during embryonic phases or fetal lethality, nor yield structural or functional cardiac modifications in adulthood, its recovery in transgenic animals induced an enhancement in cardiac morphology and function following myocardial infarction induced by LAD surgery. Although its precise function remains undefined, this manuscript suggests its influence on genes associated with the NKX2-5 transcription factor. Major 1- I found the introduction to be quite engaging. However, enhancing the overall coherence of the work could involve establishing a more explicit connection between collagen deposition, scar formation, and fibrosis within the context of a myocardial infarction model. Addressing this interrelationship in the introduction would be particularly advantageous, given its enduring significance over time, as opposed to the relatively less prevalent occurrence of compensatory hypertrophy. 2- In the study conducted by Werber et al. (2014), the group generated a comprehensive dataset elucidating the transcriptional landscape of cardiac tissue. Notably, they identified a specific RNA molecule that exhibits exclusive expression within the heart tissue context. Conversely, in the context of the present research, the rationale behind investigating the lncRNA Swhtr appears to lack clarity Establishing a logical connection with the Nkx2-5 factor could potentially serve to justify the selection of the lncRNA under investigation. This strategic link could bolster the rationale for studying lncRNA Swhtr and its potential relevance within the broader context of cardiac biology. 3- I appreciate the researchers' elegant approach in illustrating the spatial distribution of lncRNA across diverse embryonic stages. Nevertheless, I am left wondering whether the researchers considered expanding their analysis to encompass additional developmental stages, such as the newborn (NB) phase. This query stems from the findings highlighted in the current study, where the NB phase emerges as the highest lncRNA window expression and, conceivably, a pivotal period of heightened lncRNA activity (Bridges et al., 2021; Gomes et al., 2017). Remarkably, this pattern aligns with the outcomes derived from Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) analyses conducted on cultured cardiac cells (Fig. 1H). Thus, contemplating lncRNA dynamics during the newborn phase could offer valuable insights into its plausible functional roles and accentuate its significance within the intricate framework of cardiac biology. 4- In figures 3A-F, the inclusion of a Sham WT control group would be highly valuable. While I recognize the challenges associated with conducting additional experiments for a new group, the incorporation of Sham animals could substantially enhance the interpretability of the results. Specifically, the comparison between disease-induced (LAD) effects on both WT and KO (Swhtr3x/pA3xpA) groups and their corresponding Sham WT counterparts would offer insightful insights into survival rates and cardiac function data. For instance, the introduction of a Sham WT group could illuminate noteworthy differences in ejection fraction. It is conceivable that the KO animals subjected to LAD would exhibit a potentially significant reduction in ejection fraction when contrasted with the healthy Sham WT group. In contrast, both the WT and Transgenic animals may not display statistically significant deviations from the Sham WT group, thereby accentuating the therapeutic benefits conferred by the treatment. Incorporating a Sham WT control group would contribute significantly to the robustness of the findings, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of the treatment's efficacy and its impact on cardiac function under both normal and disease conditions. 5- I believe that a more comprehensive characterization of the animals subjected to LAD would greatly enrich the study. Showing fibrosis and hypertrophy could lead to more holistic understanding of the animals' phenotype. Also, presenting the expressions of specific collagen types, particularly collagen III, which typically manifests in the initial weeks following an infarction, would help. This additional analysis would provide a deeper insight into the fibrotic response triggered by the myocardial infarction and contribute to a comprehensive appreciation of the tissue remodeling process. Furthermore, the inclusion of molecular markers associated with cardiac hypertrophy would be a significant asset to the study. 6- Extending the observation period for animals subjected to LAD and tracking them until the development of heart failure would offer a comprehensive perspective on morphological and functional cardiac changes over time. This longitudinal approach holds the promise of uncovering the dynamic role of the identified lncRNA in disease progression, providing valuable insights into its potential as a modulator or indicator of pathological processes associated with heart failure. 7- An elegant dimension could be added to the study if the researchers were to explore the effects of lncRNA Swthr deletion and gain of function in alternate models of hypertrophy. Considering the potential role of this lncRNA in governing cardiac hypertrophy, examining its impact on both pathological and physiological hypertrophic scenarios could yield valuable insights. Employing the transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model for inducing pathological hypertrophy would provide a robust hypertrophic stimulus, while unveiling the lncRNA's effects in physiological hypertrophy through aerobic exercise sessions would establish a nuanced connection between hypertrophy modulation and lncRNA activity. By encompassing these distinct scenarios, the study could present a comprehensive perspective on lncRNA's role in different hypertrophic contexts, thereby enhancing our understanding of its regulatory influence on cardiac adaptation. 8- The utilization of cardiac tissue culture is indeed an intriguing aspect of the study. Expanding this approach, perhaps in future studies, to encompass diverse infarction zones, including border and remote areas, would not only enhance the study's sophistication but also provide invaluable insights into the nuanced RNA profile characteristics of distinct zones adapting to the pathological stimulus. Moreover, performing an RNA expression profile analysis within the hearts of transgenic animals subjected to LAD holds promise in uncovering potential gene alterations and regulatory effects mediated by the lncRNA. This multifaceted exploration could unravel a comprehensive landscape of gene expression changes triggered by the lncRNA, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of its intricate role in the cardiac response to myocardial infarction. Minor - I believe it would be important to use Medical Subject Headings for the keywords, I suggest: Cardiac hypertrophy, long non-coding RNA, myocardial infarction. - In figures 1C-E the researchers interestingly use the lacZ reporter technique. It would be interesting and necessary to present the technique used in the methods. - The sentence to describe Swhtr labeling in heart and other tissue was a bit confusing and could be improved in clarity (line 199-122). - In Figure 1F, I believe there was a significant difference; if possible, provide the statistical symbol. Also in figure F, did the authors use any housekeeping gene to correct the expression? I think it would be more interesting to show the relative expression versus the absolute. - During the manuscript, Swhtr and Swhtr lncRNA are used, I particularly think the name followed by lncRNA is more elegant. - I believe that if the 1G figure were presented with separate bars, it will make the result much easier to understand. - I believe it would make the text easier to understand if 3G figure were moved to position 3B - It would be very interesting to demonstrate in figure 3H, in addition to the knock-out and Tg, also the LAD surgery and the time course. - Line 218, I think you addressed the wrong image (is it 3G?). - In the methods it would be important to define the term ES cells and mESCs (Embryonic stem cells) (line 342); Line 415, 465, 466, 467 use qPCR as in the rest of manuscript. It would be important to state in the manuscript how much tissue or cells were used for RNA extraction. It would also be nice to tell in the body of the text the time it took to extract the tissues, they are described in the methods, but I believe that it would enhance the work by being close to the results.

The manuscript ""Adaptation of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Transcriptome to Biofilm Growth"" delves into the intricate variations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transcription patterns. It uncovers disparities between the ancestral L4 strains and those exposed to selective pressure for biofilm formation. This previously unexplored phenomenon holds potential insights into host interactions, making it a compelling avenue for comprehending disease pathogenesis. MAJOR POINTS: ** This preprint represents a continuation of the research group's prior study published in 2022. Within this work, the researchers skillfully leverage transcriptomics techniques to illuminate the intricate irregularities that govern biofilm formation in mycobacteria. The employed methodologies not only establish a robust foundation but also showcase a meticulously outlined methodology. However, it's noteworthy that the text's structure occasionally reintroduces specific passages in both the results and recommendations sections. A potential benefit to the text could be achieved by addressing and eliminating these redundancies. ** The introduction and discussion lack information describing mycobacteria and biofilms in general. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), for example, are well described in terms of their ability to form biofilm. These environmental and opportunistic organisms represent a problem for water treatment systems and in the hospital environment. ** The discussion about phenotypic variation is superficially described. A more thorough discussion of this phenomenon can contribute to the findings. ** As described, MMMC duplication has already been observed by other authors. Under which growth conditions has this been seen? Does this corroborate or contrast from the point of view of biofilm formation? ** The origin of the strains is not exactly clear. The strains chosen deserve a brief description of the patients from whom they were collected and their pathogenesis. In addition, was any characterization performed on the resistance profile of the strains? The relationship between biofilms and susceptibility should be further explored.

The study analyses genome-wide DNA methylation and differential gene expression in the initial generation (heat-stressed and control) and their three subsequent non-stressed asexual generations. The authors observed a decreasing transfer of the stress-induced molecular memory across the generations. Their work has originality/novelty, and we believe the biological question they seek to answer can be interesting for the plant sciences community. We would like to provide some suggestions which we believe might enhance the quality of the manuscript. Please be aware that these suggestions are not exhaustive. Major comments •	Please include additional information so as to allow the research to be replicable and reproducible. For example, saying “9:00-11:00 a.m.” might not be precise enough. Using the specific light zeitgeber would better inform when samples were harvested in the diel cycle (lines 140 and 161). Another example, the description “Illumina paired end read sequencing (150 bp)” appears to omit crucial details concerning the specific options utilised in the NGS experiment. Important information, such as mRNA selection method, library construction kit, sequencing platform, and the strand-specificity of reads, among other factors, should be included. Line 192: Please state which transcriptome was used with Salmon. Line 282: Which clustering method was used to build the heatmaps? •	The claim that “… genes linked to gibberellin pathways may contribute to a short transcriptional memory.” should be discussed with the literature. •	Line 642-644: Kindly review the claim in relation to what is depicted in the figure. Minor comments •	We recommend English editing to enhance grammar and clarity. •	Scientific names must always be italicised. In the first appearance of the species, it is also required to list the person (or team) who first made the scientific name of that taxon available. •	Lines 131, 134 and 144: could you please add the light intensity in µmol m-2 s-1? •	Line 135: Is there a specific scientific or practical rationale for maintaining consistent temperatures in stress assays throughout both day and night, while implementing varying diel thermos-cycles for control and recovery conditions? •	Line: 158: We found it a bit difficult to understand what was actually collected. •	Line 166: please, add the reference where we can find more details on the bisulfide method used. •	Line 193: It would make it easier for the reader to understand what the authors mean by DEG if the DESeq2 default parameters were described here. Is it log-fold change, p-value cut-off, etc? •	Lines 205-207: Could you provide information on the duration of the heat-stress treatments? •	Lines 264-267: Do terms like ""low,"" ""hypermethylation,"" and ""hypomethylation"" refer to a comparison with data from control samples? The comparison between different samples was not really clear to us. The same applies to “significantly different” (line 281). •	Figure 1A: We think this figure could be improved to help the reader understand the temperatures used for CM. Additionally, could you confirm whether the application of 24°C on recovery days precisely occurred for 48 hours? It seems that the temperature might not be exactly 24°C, and we think the figure could provide more precise details. •	Figure 1B: Why are scissors, “2w” and “sampling” shown only on the right-hand side of the figure? •	Figure 1C: Detecting differences among samples based on the y-axis is proving to be challenging for us. The authors might want to contemplate plotting by C contexts on the x-axis, or alternatively, segmenting the y-axis into three distinct regions where resolution could be enhanced around 1-5, 13-17, and 38-42. •	Figure 3B: Is it possible to apply colour shading similar to that seen in a heatmap for this figure? •	Figure 3D: Kindly review the genes mentioned in the figure legend in relation to what is depicted in the figure. •	Line 280-281: The phrase between the brackets seems a bit confusing. We recommend rephrasing it for clarity. •	It might be advisable for the authors to verify whether they are employing a colour-blind-friendly palette. •	Some of the finer details in the figures are quite challenging to discern, making it difficult to interpret the results. •	The expression patterns of several FvHSFs were described previously (López et al., 2022), some also undergoing promoter demethylation. How does the expression patterns of these HSFs change in response to a temperature gradient challenge? We believe the paper would considerably improve if heat-shock proteins and chaperones are also investigated.",2023-08-21T17:16:09,cristianepaulagomescalixto,Cristiane Paula Gomes Calixto,,,,

First, it's wrong to write that scDblFinder is ""formerly known as doubletCells"". They're two methods developed independently, and it's simply that doubletCells was moved to the same package, but still as an independent method. Second, your results are in contrast with other benchmarks, which you explain by more ""realistic scRNA-seq datasets"". I'm obviously not entirely disinterested here, but I think this is very misleading: you don't show any evidence that the traditional benchmark datasets do have unrealistic patient or batch effects, and omit to mention the critical fact that, as far as I know, the fatemap samples are homogeneous cell lines, which is far from being more realistic (people do scRNAseq on complex tissues much more often than on cell lines). I think a fairer description would be to abandon the ""realistic/unrealistic"" labels, describe your data as it is, and hence that your observations are basically about homotypic doublets, which the tested methods are very bad at detecting (but also don't claim to do). The lack of real difference between adjacent/distant seems to indicate pretty clearly that you're essentially dealing with homotypic doublets.",2023-08-16T13:06:21,pierrelucgermain,Pierre-Luc Germain,,,,

You need a better citation for this. 2) You've got my name wrong. I have no comment on the science though.",2023-08-16T08:41:23,lscottblankenship,L Scott Blankenship,,,,
