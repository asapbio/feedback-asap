The research emphasizes the importance of this model for understanding heart development and disease. The authors provide a detailed methodology for generating the assembloids, coupled with multi-omic analyses and functional assays, demonstrating the model's capacity to emulate key cardiac and immune processes. However, while the study presents comprehensive data and a novel approach, certain areas require further clarification and detailed statistical analysis to strengthen the findings. Major Revisions 1. Statistical Analysis: The study lacks detailed statistical information to support the presented data. Including p-values, confidence intervals, and statistical tests used for each dataset is crucial for validating the results (e.g., Figures and gene set enrichment plots). 2. Reproducibility of Methods: While the methods section is comprehensive, it would benefit from additional clarity on specific protocols to ensure reproducibility. Including precise details about reagents, equipment, and any variations in experimental conditions can aid reproducibility (e.g., generation of heart assembloids). 3. Integration of Findings: The discussion should integrate the findings more thoroughly with existing literature. Highlighting how the study advances the field and addressing possible discrepancies with previous studies will provide a stronger context for the research. 4. Limitations and Future Work: The discussion needs a more critical examination of the study's limitations, potential biases, and confounding factors. Proposals for future research directions should be specified to guide subsequent investigations. Minor Revisions 1. Typographical and Formatting Errors: - Page 15, Figure 2 legend: The phrase ""∆ë ëë ë ëëë"" is a clear formatting error that needs correction. - Verify consistent formatting of subheadings and figure legends throughout the manuscript. 2. Definition of Terms: Ensure all technical terms, abbreviations, and acronyms are defined upon their first appearance. This will enhance readability for a broader audience. 3. Reference Formatting: Ensure all references are correctly formatted according to the journal's guidelines. Cross-check for the latest updates in cited references. 4. AI Content Analysis: Based on language consistency and technical depth, the estimated percentage of AI-generated content seems minimal. No sections explicitly exhibit characteristics typical of AI-generated text. Recommendations 1. Enhancing Data Presentation: Incorporate more statistical data into figures and tables, such as error bars and exact p-values, to reinforce the reliability of the results. 2. Detailed Protocols: Append a supplementary section with detailed step-by-step protocols for key procedures to facilitate reproducibility by other researchers. 3. Expanded Abstract: Enrich the abstract with specific quantitative results to provide a clearer snapshot of the study's impact and conclusions. 4.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.01.530249v1#comment-6605217382,biorxivstage,1,"The mechanism driving miRNA load and 3’UTR lengthening and its subsequent effect on mRNA half life, and the significance of mRNA stability mechanisms shaping gene expression and 3’UTR usage during human neurodevelopment are well documented. The manuscript by Ellis et al. investigates an alternative approach to systematically quantify transcription rate and mRNA stability using RATE-seq and SLAM-seq to further validate the relevance of miRNA loads among induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), neural progenitors (NPC), and neurons (Neu). This approach expands on the role of mRNA stability in shaping transcriptional buffering and driving 3’UTR lengthening via miRNA load. The paper suggests a comprehensive approach towards understanding the regulation of mRNA stability and transcription rates during human neurodevelopment. The use of RATE-seq as a technique for measuring half-life and transcription rates was a powerful and novel approach to dive deeper into the current understanding of this field, and could be applicable to future studies.   The authors also explore the idea of a mechanistic link between miRNA regulation and transcriptome changes. The reproducibility of results between cell types was reinforced that accumulation of miRNAs during neurodevelopment potentially leads to preferential degradation of short 3' UTR-containing mRNAs in neurons. The manuscript outlined the following findings about neuronal differentiating cells: i) mRNA stability and transcription rate play an equal role in establishing steady-state levels of the transcriptome, ii) buffering genes controlled by pluripotency transcription factors are regulated by mRNA stability, iii) increased miRNA load corresponds to mRNA degradation of most genes in neurons, and iv) preferential degradation of neuronal short 3’ UTR-containing mRNAs resulting in decreased RNA stability. These are not novel findings to the scientific community but the reproduction of previous research is not without merit. Reproducibility is a hallmark of quality scientific discovery.  However the novelty of this research is demonstrated in the unique sequencing protocols and statistical techniques utilized. Despite this achievement the paper doesn’t sufficiently expand the literature in such a way that qualifies it for publication. Given the issues outlined below, the manuscript must address the following concerns prior to acceptance for publication. One of the most pressing major concerns is the lack of a discernable attempt to close the gap in knowledge regarding the relationship between mRNA stability and transcriptional regulation during neurodevelopment. Specifically, the manuscript demonstrates the shifts in mRNA stability and 3’UTR lengthening. These results have already been documented in previous literature thus leaving unclear how this research advances the field and our understanding beyond known mechanisms. The question of whether miRNA load is sufficient or necessary to drive 3’UTR lengthening should be addressed in any future iterations of this paper. The authors could address this concern by designing an experiment to validate the causal relationship between increasing miRNA load and 3’ UTR lengthening. This can be achieved experimentally by overexpressing miRNA in human cell lines and tracking subsequent increases or decreases in 3’UTR lengthening. A second major concern that should ideally be remedied by the authors is the use of a single experimental cell line. To strengthen the quality of the research performed in this manuscript experiments should be orthogonally validated in other human cell lines. Justification of each cell line used should be explicitly mentioned in the manuscript. Additional tissue types can also be explored experimentally to strengthen the mechanistic link. The minor concern that needs to be addressed by the authors of Ellis et al. is the addition of a justification of the time points used during data collection. This context will allow readers more insight into the overall logic of the experiment. It is generally understood that the chosen time points are typical when working with neural cells but this logic may not be clear to an individual not actively involved in the field.",2024-12-05T03:18:42,,Arianna,10.1101/2023.03.01.530249,Transcriptional buffering and 3ʹUTR lengthening are shaped during human neurodevelopment by shifts in mRNA stability and microRNA load,"Marat Mufteev, Deivid C.

SoxC transcription factors (Sox4, Sox11, Sox12) are identified as critical regulators of embryonic programs reactivated in CRC, driving tumor progression and poor patient survival. Using murine and organoid models, the authors elucidate SoxC-driven pathways influencing chromatin remodeling, proliferation, and metastasis. Despite robust experimental frameworks, translational gaps and underexplored mechanistic details need addressing. Major Revisions Mechanistic Elucidation Insufficient Detail on SoxC-Driven Programs: The role of SoxC in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation is well-documented. However, indirect targets (e.g., Mdk) require deeper exploration. Linking protein networks (e.g., Figure 3A) to specific cellular processes in tumor microenvironments would enhance clarity (Section: Results, p.7). Immune Modulation Underexplored: SoxC’s regulation of immune-related genes (e.g., Mif, Il19) is introduced but lacks functional validation. Including immune cell profiling from tumor environments or patient samples could substantiate claims (Section: Results, p.8). Clinical Relevance Translational Gaps: The manuscript emphasizes SoxC’s therapeutic potential but lacks direct discussion on pharmacological inhibitors. For example, the clinical applicability of targeting Tead2 or Mdk in CRC contexts remains speculative (Section: Discussion, p.10). Prognostic Model Validation: The SoxC-oncoembryonic signature is promising, but additional validation in independent, larger patient cohorts is essential to ensure reproducibility and clinical utility (Section: Results, p.9). Experimental Controls Baseline Comparisons for SoxC Inhibition: While SoxC-KO models demonstrate tumor suppression, parallel experiments using standard chemotherapies or combination treatments would provide comparative benchmarks (Section: Results, p.8). Hindgut Model Robustness: The embryonic hindgut model is compelling but differs significantly from adult tumor environments. Supplementary experiments incorporating human organoids or ex vivo models could address potential translational limitations (Section: Methods, p.11). Data Presentation and Statistical Rigor Incomplete Statistical Details: Kaplan-Meier analyses (e.g., Figure 3C) require hazard ratios and confidence intervals. Clarifying thresholds for “high” and “low” gene expression groups would strengthen interpretability. Underrepresented Raw Data: Additional raw data (e.g., ATAC-seq peaks, ChIP-seq binding sites) should be included to validate the claims of direct SoxC target regulation (Section: Results, p.6). Minor Revisions Typos and Formatting Figures: Figure legends occasionally omit critical methodological details (e.g., staining conditions in Figure 5A). Grammar: Line 154, ""which may be similarly drive CRC progression,"" should read ""which may similarly drive CRC progression."" AI Content Analysis Estimated AI-Generated Content: ~10-15%. Implications: Stylistically consistent but occasionally repetitive phrases (e.g., ""regulates both embryonic and cancerous programs"") suggest AI-assisted drafting. This does not detract from the scientific rigor but indicates potential areas for manual refinement. Terminology Consistency Key terms such as ""oncoembryonic genes"" and ""progenitor maintenance"" are inconsistently applied across sections. Standardizing definitions would aid clarity (e.g., Section: Introduction, p.2). Ethical and Methodological Transparency The manuscript references ethical approvals but omits details about humane endpoints for animal studies (Section: Methods, p.11). Expanding on regulatory compliance would ensure adherence to ethical standards. Citations References to foundational studies (e.g., Weinberg, 1996; Hanahan, 2022) should be balanced with more recent CRC-specific literature. Recommendations Mechanistic Depth: Incorporate RNA-seq or proteomic analyses to map SoxC interactions with immune pathways and chromatin regulators. Validate indirect target regulation (e.g., Mdk, Tead2) using perturbation assays. Clinical Insights: Expand discussion of SoxC inhibitors and therapeutic strategies, including potential combination therapies targeting chromatin remodeling. Data Enhancements: Provide supplementary raw datasets for reproducibility, including ATAC-seq peaks and Kaplan-Meier survival data.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.27.625706v1#comment-6604403219,biorxivstage,0,"Courtesy review from xPeerd.com Summary This manuscript investigates a novel locoregional therapy, MBC-005, targeting p21 induction via intratumoral percutaneous administration in BALB/c mice bearing breast cancer liver metastases. The work demonstrates a 3.9-fold increase in survival and tumor volume reduction through a hydrogel delivery system designed to mitigate hydrophobicity and enzymatic degradation of the active compound. While the study makes a strong case for MBC-005’s preclinical efficacy, there are gaps in experimental design, mechanistic exploration, and translational relevance. Major Revisions 1. Mechanistic Clarity The manuscript attributes MBC-005’s effects to p21 induction but does not sufficiently explain how this mechanism influences overall tumor microenvironment dynamics, such as angiogenesis or immune modulation. Including downstream effects of p21 upregulation (e.g., cell cycle arrest versus immune response interplay) would improve the study’s depth (Section: Results, p.8). Further exploration of how N-allyl noroxymorphone interacts with the opioid growth factor receptor, specifically in liver-specific metastases, is required to justify its locoregional application (Section: Discussion, p.11). 2. Experimental Controls Absence of Baseline Control for Locoregional Therapies: Comparative efficacy with locoregional standards like radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is missing. This would contextualize MBC-005’s potential advantages (Section: Results, p.7). Dose-Response Study Gaps: Although the study evaluates a range of MBC-005 doses, a detailed dose-response curve for survival benefit is absent. Highlighting toxicity thresholds across doses would strengthen the rationale for the selected therapeutic window (Section: Results, p.9). 3. Translation and Scalability Translational relevance remains underdeveloped. For example, the manuscript does not discuss challenges related to scaling hydrogel administration for clinical imaging systems or variability in tumor sizes (Section: Discussion, p.12). Specific limitations of murine liver tumor models compared to human liver metastases (e.g., perfusion, immune differences) should be acknowledged. 4. Reproducibility and Statistical Rigor The manuscript does not provide raw data or error ranges in figures showing critical in vivo findings (e.g., Figures 3, 10). The absence of confidence intervals or standard error bars undermines the reliability of these results. Statistical comparisons (e.g., Figure 9 survival curves) are inconsistently reported. Inclusion of hazard ratios and Kaplan-Meier plots with confidence intervals is needed. 5. Safety and Toxicity While the manuscript claims MBC-005 induces no off-target toxicity, details on off-target organ effects are insufficient. Clinical chemistry and histopathology for other critical organs (e.g., kidneys, spleen, heart) would provide a more comprehensive toxicity profile (Section: Results, p.10). 6. Ethical and Methodological Transparency Ethical approval processes are ambiguously described, particularly regarding animal welfare protocols. Details about analgesia and endpoint criteria for euthanasia in murine models are essential (Section: Methods, p.4). Specific imaging protocols for tumor measurement (e.g., ultrasound or bioluminescence imaging) lack clarity regarding resolution and reproducibility parameters. Minor Revisions 1. AI Content Analysis Estimated AI-Generated Content: ~20-25%. Detected Issues: Over-reliance on templated phrases, particularly in introductory and summary sections (e.g., ""poor prognosis; and, when treated with the standard of care systemic therapy they have a median survival of <9-months""). Impact: While these sections are stylistically consistent, they weaken the originality of argumentation. Rewriting these areas to reflect a more critical and nuanced understanding of literature would improve epistemic integrity. 2. Figures and Tables Some figures, such as Figure 10 (Kaplan-Meier survival curves), lack clarity and appropriate legends to describe their analytical methodology. Tables presenting survival metrics (e.g., Table III) should incorporate statistical significance indicators. 3. Terminology Consistency Terms like ""locoregional therapies"" and ""p21 induction"" are inconsistently defined across sections, leading to potential reader confusion. 4. Citations Certain key statements lack direct citation support (e.g., ""Locoregional therapies are appealing due to their minimally invasive nature""). Verify these with authoritative sources to enhance credibility (Section: Introduction, p.3). 5. Formatting and Typos Line 256: Repeated phrase ""was also shown to be significantly decreased."" Ensure uniform formatting of references (e.g., adherence to journal-specific citation styles). Recommendations Enhance Mechanistic Insights: Integrate RNA-seq or proteomic analyses to identify downstream signaling pathways influenced by p21 induction. Evaluate immune cell infiltration or cytokine profiling in treated tumors to investigate secondary effects. Address Limitations: Explicitly discuss how murine models differ from human metastases and any anticipated challenges in clinical translation. Improve Data Presentation: Add confidence intervals, raw data, and Kaplan-Meier analyses for survival metrics. Ensure all figures include clear legends, error bars, and scale descriptions. Augment Comparisons with Existing Therapies: Introduce comparative benchmarks with locoregional standards (e.g., RFA, PEI) to establish MBC-005’s potential superiority.

Here three non-ML algorithms are studied against one existing ML model — Random Forest (RF), which was directly trained to predict this physical property in a previous study. The results suggest physics-based simulations in general provide better estimates compared to the ML/structural-based methods when benchmarking to experimental measures, especially against distal mutations. Overall the manuscript is well-written and provides a sufficient amount of detail in each methodology used. Here are our comments: 1. The generalizability of the trained ML model is not immediately clear to us. It would be helpful if the author can include some data analyses on this model with the train/validation/test datasets in this manuscript to show the audience the performance of the model. How was the dataset different from Aldeghi et al. ACS central science 5, no. 8 (2019): 1468-1474? Will RF model predict better if it is trained on the Platinum database? Will a combination of Platinum database to data used in this manuscript improve the predicting ability of the model? 2. Following the previous comment, similar to neural nets, deep tree-based methods can be easily overfitted to the training data, is this also expected here?The NanoBRET vs. measurements in Hauser el al (2018) scatter plot and NanoBRET vs. RF plot look very similar to each other. Could that be evidence of overfitting to the dataset? Again it would be beneficial to present some results on model training. 3. As the authors summarized in the end, the physics-based simulation methods outperform structural/ ML-based methods. Does this mean by introducing structural descriptors to machine learning models, the predictions can be largely improved. This could be easily validated by retraining a RF model with additional (distal) features, which can be a valuable ML-based benchmark for future study. 4. While the authors provide a detailed investigation of the effects of forcefield selection in non-equilibrium perturbation (NEQ), the free energy calculations (FEP+) method does not seem well studied under various forcefield parameters. Is there a reason why OPLS was chosen for FEP+ and GAFF/CGenFF were selected for NEQ? If so, please elucidate. 5. The authors may want to comment on the utility of the training dataset from Hauser et al. (2018) given the importance of measuring the ΔΔG values for each TKI from a single measurement as demonstrated and alluded to in this paper. 6. Can the authors comment on the structural basis for the impact of distal mutations (Supp. Fig. 5, 6) which have a significant impact on inhibitor binding? It might also be useful to make a separate list for the identity of the mutated residue, their ΔΔG values, distance from the active site, RMSE and correlation values for these interesting mutations. 7. The RF model has been trained with mostly nearly-neutral point mutations. Is it expected to perform well for large-effect resistant or sensitive mutations for which experimental ΔΔG values are not within the 土1 kcal/mol range? 8. The authors assign a mutation as resistant if both the NanoBRET and computational approach predict an increase in ΔΔG by ΔΔG > +1 kcal/mol . What about the performance of the models on mutations for which the predicted -1 < ΔΔG  9. It is unclear if there are H-bond interactions between the water molecules within 0.4 nm from T315 and other chemical groups in the vicinity, such as backbone amides or a ligand atom. Are there features in the electron density map for the crystal structure of Abl kinase that indicate other water- mediated contacts in this site that might be disrupted by the T315A mutation? Minor points: 1. Term “singular point” in PRAUC plots is only mentioned in the caption of Figure 5, it would be good to have it mentioned and defined in the main text, followed by a discussion on its significance. 2.

For instance I might expect Early and late reads in the nasal and airway samples (EBV lytic replication) whereas in the blood this could be either expansion of latency III blasts, or productive reactivation as they differentiate into plasma cells, or even an abortive replication [IE and E but no late transcripts] as they migrate to peripheral mucosal sites for transmission.",2024-12-02T10:45:47,robertewhite,Robert E White,10.1101/2024.11.14.622799,Chronic Viral Reactivation and Associated Host Immune Response and Clinical Outcomes in Acute COVID-19 and Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19,"Cole Maguire, Jing Chen, Nadine Rouphael, Harry Pickering, Hoang Van Phan, Abigail Glascock, Victoria Chu, Ravi Dandekar, David Corry, Farrah Kheradmand, Lindsey R.

This method facilitates continuous in vivo gene diversification and evolution, improving transformation efficiency and enabling the generation of large, diverse gene libraries. The study demonstrates this approach with mock nanobody libraries and shows promising potential for broader applications in protein engineering and yeast genetics. Major Revisions 1. Claim Confidence and Validation: - Doubts arise around the degree to which the claimed efficiency improvements can be generalized beyond the specific experimental parameters used. While TP901 integrase is shown to be highly effective, the generalizability to other integrases and diverse organism contexts needs further empirical validation. Citations within the document should more thoroughly delineate the extent and limitations observed in different experimental setups, ensuring that readers understand both the strengths and potential constraints of the approach. - The manuscript briefly mentions (in the introduction and results sections) comparative transformation efficiencies but lacks detailed statistical analysis and discussion on potential variances across different yeast strains or growth conditions. 2. Methodological Transparency: - The preprint should provide more detailed step-by-step protocols, especially for the transformation and sorting processes, to improve reproducibility. Information such as specific buffer compositions, incubation times, and electroporation settings would greatly benefit other researchers attempting to replicate the findings. - The current data representation (e.g., Fig. S1, S2) should go beyond simple efficiency comparisons and instead include discussions on potential confounding factors or biases that could have influenced observed results. 3. Data Integration and Interpretation: - The interpretation of multiple integrations per cell should include discussions around the biological implications of such events and how they might influence long-term genome stability and gene expression profiles in yeast cells. - Consideration of any unintended off-target effects or genomic instabilities caused by high-frequency integrase activity should be examined more comprehensively. Minor Revisions 1. Typos and Formatting Issues: - Correct minor typographical errors such as ""chromitinization"" which should be ""chromatinization"". - Maintain consistency in the citation format and ensure that all figures and tables are accurately referenced within the text. 2. AI Content Analysis: - It is estimated that approximately 10-15% of the text could have been influenced by AI-generated content, specifically in highly repetitive methodological details and generalized scientific language. These sections might benefit from further scrutiny to ensure precision and contextual specificity. Recommendations 1. Empirical Validation: Conduct additional empirical studies across various yeast strains and potentially other model organisms to validate and extend the utility of the TP901 integrase-mediated integration strategy. 2. Protocol Detail Enhancement: Provide more comprehensive methodological details and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to assist in replication and application. 3. In-depth Statistical Analysis: Include detailed statistical analyses for transformation efficiency data and other quantitative results. 4. Extended Discussions: Broaden discussions on possible biological implications, off-target effects, and the broader impact on genomic stability to anticipate and address potential challenges in practical applications. 5. Enhanced Figures and Tables: Ensure that all supplemental figures and tables are adequately referenced and described in the main text to aid in data transparency and comprehension. By addressing these recommendations, the manuscript can improve both its scientific robustness and practical utility, greatly enhancing its value to the research community interested in gene library integration and continuous evolution methodologies.",2024-12-01T12:54:07,xpeerd,xPeer,10.1101/2024.11.29.626108,Ultra-Efficient Integration of Gene Libraries onto Yeast Cytosolic Plasmids,"Alexander Pisera, Yutong Yu, Rory L Williams, Chang C Liu",2024-11-30

The approach employs lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)-based mRNA therapeutics to transiently overexpress P-gp in cardiomyocytes, reducing intracellular Dox levels and associated cytotoxic effects, both in vitro and in vivo. The study demonstrates promising results, including enhanced survival rates and improved cardiac function in treated mice and pigs. However, detailed analysis and validation in clinical settings are needed. Major Revisions 1. Ethics and Concerns on mRNA Technology: The preprint does not provide comprehensive information on the long-term safety and potential mutagenic effects of repeated mRNA administration. Although the authors claim no potential insertion mutagenesis, a detailed toxicological assessment must be included. - Example: The long-term impact on genomic stability has been vaguely mentioned (Section: Results, Page 6) but needs further elaboration. 2. Effectiveness on Large Animal Models: While the study highlights the preliminary success in pigs, it lacks comprehensive physiological data, myocardial histopathology, and the functional impact across different heart failure stages. - Example: The pig model data is summarized, but detailed statistical analysis and larger sample size validation are crucial (Discussion, Page 7). 3. Broader Relevance and Risk Mitigation: The potential immunogenicity of LNPs and mRNA therapeutics should be discussed to address the broader clinical relevance and possible adverse immune responses. - Example: Immune response considerations are barely discussed (Page 10), which is critical for clinical translation. Recommendations 1. Enhance Toxicology and Safety Data: Include detailed data on the longitudinal impact of mRNA administration, focusing on potential genomic stability issues and systemic safety profiles. Consider supplementary studies evaluating mutagenic and oncogenic risks. 2. Comprehensive Animal Model Studies: Expand the large animal model studies to include a broader sample size and various cardiovascular conditions, supplemented with detailed histopathological analyses. 3. Immune Response Mitigation: Address potential immunogenicity by conducting comprehensive immunological assessments on treated animals and documenting any adverse reactions. Present a risk mitigation strategy for the clinical setting. 4. Expanded Clinical Relevance Exploration: Provide a more robust discussion on how to adapt the TopCare strategy to different cancer treatments, varying dosages, and combined therapies to ensure broader applicability. Minor Revisions 1. Textual and Formatting Errors: - Correct minor typographical errors and ensure consistent formatting across sections. Specific errors to address: - Page 2, Title capitalization inconsistency (""Cardiac Reprogramm...""). - Figure labels and axis titles should follow uniform font size and style (Section: Results). 2.

I keenly followed the Conceptual Penis hoax (Boghossian and Lindsay) as it unfolded in real time as I was writing my book on predatory publishing. Although it initially correctly stated that the Conceptual Penis hoax as exposing gender studies, he later says they published in a predatory journal. This is incorrect. There were peer review problems but no predatory publishing. They submitted the article to a prestigious gender studies journal, NORMA: International Journal for Masculinity Studies, from Taylor and Francis. The journal rejected the article and transferred the article down to another T & F lower-tier open access journal, Cogent Social Sciences. This editorial process is called “cascading.”  The less prestigious journal peer-reviewed it and, when it was accepted, requested an APC. After publication, the authors revealed the hoax, and the article was retracted; the journal explained that the peer reviewers for the lower tier publication lacked experience.

At least it is now demonstrated. I however have some doubt about the host range analysis, because the methods applied are not very clear. It is written that the host range was assigned with COPLA (l.159). But I guess that the host range inferred by COPLA includes all  plasmids in their database for each PTU, including some containing AMR genes. So in the last (and most important) section of the manuscript, removing the ARG-carrying plasmids from the AMR+ PTUs will not change the host range classification given by COPLA. This bring an inconsistency between the given host range and the actual plasmids in the 118 ARG-free PTUs investigated. My feeling is that the rare grade V+VI PTUs are actually caused by ARG carriage, bringing a great fitness advantage in very distant bacterial hosts in which plasmids should otherwise struggle to maintain because of maladaptation. It will be necessary I think to calculate the host range only with the data investigated in the study, simply by looking at the plasmid's host taxonomy and not rely on COPLA results. Like this it can be calculated independently for the various sets of PTUs (with/without pAMR). Other samll comment : in figure 2 355 PTUs containing 13,048 plasmids are given in top panl but less than 8000 plasmids and 50 PTUs are given in bottom panel, and it is not indicated what was the display threshold in bottom panel.

All the members of the group, including external guests, are acknowledged for participating in the discussion and providing feedback that was useful to prepare this report. The corresponding author of the original manuscript was consulted before posting this report. Summary The authors introduce a method to perform maximum entropy reweighting of molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, specifically addressing the choice of regularization parameters. Interestingly, an automatic procedure to determine the relative strength of the regularization terms acting on different experimental datapoints is proposed. The method is then applied to extensive MD simulations of 5 intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) using 3 different force fields. For 3 of the tested IDPs, different simulations converge to the similar ensembles after reweighting. For the other 2, the ensemble overlap is too limited, and the reweighted ensemble is significantly force-field dependent. We are mostly interested in the methodological part of the paper. Technical innovations are: * The idea of including the statistical error of the MD, as computed with block analysis, in the regularization term. * The idea of performing preliminary regularization scans for individual sets of experiments to tune the relative uncertainty, and ultimately end up with a single parameter (prefactor) to be tuned. * The idea of tuning the parameters monitoring the Kish sample size. To our knowledge, the comparative results for the 5 IDPs and 3 force fields are also new and very relevant. Comments * Could there be some speculation by the authors on the relative role of the water model and of the protein force field? The way results are presented, it is not clear if the reason for the discrepancies is in the protein force field or in the water model. Maybe it is not possible to disentangle them. * The authors evaluate the errors of the employed forward models by applying the Flyvbjerg block analysis method, which only estimates statistical errors, without keeping into account possible systematic errors in the forward models themselves. We would suggest to clarify it in the text. * In many sentences of the main text, the authors use the word ""weight"" to refer both to the statistical weight of each frame in the trajectory and to the strength of the experimental restraints. To avoid undesired misunderstandings, we suggest to use words like ""strength"" or ""confidence"" of the experimental data/restraints etc. * Figure 2B is unexpected. The authors used the derivation from Cesari et al JCTC (2016) to introduce uncertainty in the experimental observation. This is formally equivalent to BioEn (Koefinger and Hummer, 2015) if the theta hyperparameter is set to 1. If we understood correctly how the global scaling was applied, its scan would correspond to a scan over theta in the BioEn formalism. When doing so, it can be proven analytically that the chi^2 should be a monotonic function of the regularization hyperparameter. Hence, when the authors decrease sigma_global, the average RMSE should decrease monotonically. However, in the figure all the reported RMSEs seem to be increasing for sigma → 0, so their average will increase. This seems inconsistent. Is this related to some issues with the minimization process (e.g., minimizations with a very low sigma are not converging)? Or is there something we misunderstood in the explanation? * The perfect match of the SAXS data for PaaA2 for the AMBER force field (before reweighting) is striking. Was perhaps the force field optimized using this system as a reference? If so, we would suggest to mention this in the text. * “An IDP ensemble containing ten consecutive residues [...] neighboring residues”. This is super interesting. Could the author explicitly compute this and show it? We believe it is a very interesting example of what can be observed in an MD simulation and not in a bulk experiment, and so it would be relevant to know if the answer is force field dependent or not. For instance, one could plot a 2D map with DDG associated to the helical content. * The authors quantify the similarity of two ensembles by computing the normalized overlap integral of the kernel densities in the ELViM latent space. This quantity is, by construction, sensitive to this particular choice of the ensemble representation, based on the C\alpha carbon atoms, which is in effect a dimensionality reduction. We agree that it is in practice unfeasible to evaluate the similarity between ensembles sampled in different MD simulations using quantities that do not rely on dimensionality reduction. However, when comparing reweighted with unbiased ensembles, we expect the Kish sample size to be relatively low (around 0.1), whereas the shown density overlap S is high (>0.66 for all the examined IDPs - values along the diagonal in Fig. 8B). Does this happen because the employed dimensionality reduction (based on C\alpha carbon atoms) focuses more on some robust part of the structural ensembles, preserved by the reweighting? Or is it because two different (possibly uncomparable) metrics are used? * The authors comment that leave-one-out cross validation should not be used with correlated data, and claim that this is the reason for the unexpected good performance of cross validation in Figure 2C. This is very interesting as, to our knowledge, has not been seen before. Adding more points in the low-Kish-size region might be interesting. * At some point the authors write ""We note a conceptual similarity of the reweighting procedure proposed here with the concept of gentle ensemble refinement in the recently published work of Kofinger and Hummer.32 "" We believe the authors meant to cite Ref. 33 rather than Ref. 32.",2024-11-22T19:56:01,giovannibussi,Giovanni Bussi,10.1101/2024.10.04.616700,"Towards accurate, force field independent conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins","Kaushik Borthakur, Thomas R.

During the RNA/Chimera annealing step, you applied “The samples were incubated at 95℃ for 1 minute and transferred to ice immediately.” However, the original study of Nm-VAQ and other similar experiments usually use gradient and slow cooling to ensure that the RNA and chimera have sufficient time to specifically bind rather than preferentially form secondary structures on their own, thereby affecting the subsequent cleavage of RNase H. This may be the reason for the ‘background’ described in this study and the much higher level of Nm modification seen in Fig 3C than the results in the original article. 2.	In page 7, “PLXNB2, RPL10, and TOP1 were identified as potential candidates for mRNAs with Nm modifications based on various mapping techniques. G498 for PLXNB2, G150 for RPL10, and U877 for TOP1 were the potential sites of 2’-O-methylation”, which only cited reference 29. However, we found ref 29 only reported PLXNB2 as a potential Nm site.

While it provides valuable data, the study has limitations that affect the coherence between its main objective and results. The title and introduction suggest a focus on neurotropic viruses associated with epilepsy linked to Onchocerca volvulus (OAE), but the results primarily describe viral diversity without providing evidence of these viruses. Possible explanations for the absence of neurotropic viruses are not discussed, nor are methodological alternatives proposed to address this issue. To improve the narrative, it is recommended to reframe the title and present the work as an exploratory study on viral diversity in blackflies. Methodologically, the sample size (10 blackflies per pool) and the lack of information about the genus of the collected blackflies compromise the representativeness of the data. Additionally, the criteria for excluding incomplete sequences are inconsistent, as incomplete Riboviria sequences were retained, potentially biasing abundance results. Regarding the figures, Figure 2 lacks a clear description of its columns, hindering interpretation. Figure 3 presents phylogenetic trees with barely distinguishable details, complicating analysis. In Figure 4, the point corresponding to Blackfly flavivirus does not clearly cluster with invertebrate hosts, weakening conclusions about its specificity. Analyses based on PCA and dinucleotide composition are interesting but insufficient to infer viral tropism without experimental validation. The supplementary files, although relevant, lack proper descriptions, and the main text does not specify which supplementary figure to consult, limiting their utility.

The study is very interesting and makes a significant contribution to the field of animal communication, especially by providing a quantitative approach to chimpanzee behavior.

Regarding the figures, while the information is clear and understandable, some of them could benefit from adjustments in formatting to improve their visual presentation. For instance, in Figure 4, the axes are generically labeled as “X” and “Y”; it would be helpful if these were more specifically defined to aid in interpretation. Additionally, the axis titles are in lowercase, which could be standardized for consistency. In Figure 6, the title is not centered, and some axis subtitles and the legend do not follow the proper formatting, which may make them harder to read. In Figure 8, the abbreviation “NB” is used without an explanation, which could cause ambiguity for readers unfamiliar with the term.

They construct two models of the Vt-actin complex that are hypothesized to represent a weak state and a strong state in a force-activated allostery model of the catch bond. They use enhanced sampling techniques to estimate the free-energy landscape of the unbinding process in each state, as well as the unbinding kinetics, in absence and presence of pulling forces of variable intensities and directions along the actin filament axis. Their results demonstrate higher kinetic stability for the strong state with respect to the hypothesized weak one, with unbinding kinetics in range of experimental expectations, confirming the viability of a “3-state” (2 bound states, 4 unbinding pathways) kinetic model of the bidirectional catch bond observed in single-molecule experiments. They additionally observe an increase in bond lifetimes for moderate constant pulling force (10-20 pN) in both directions, indicating an intrinsic catch-bond behavior within each “allosteric” state that may superimpose to the overall allosteric one. They show how an external pulling force affects the positioning of the H1 α-helix believed to act as a regulatory motif of the weak-to-strong transition, providing a compelling structural hypothesis for a force-induced allosteric mechanism. Finally, they provide molecular insight on the difference in stability between both states, highlighting the role of a C-terminal extension (CTE) and the redistribution of Vt-actin contacts under force. Comments * We wonder if the nomenclature “Holo” can be confusing at first glance for the reader, given the historical usage of the holo- and apo- prefixes to designate protein constructs with and without their constitutive prosthetic groups (usually non-proteic cofactors) * We suggest that the authors make clearer the composition of the Holo and Aligned protein sequences given the different numbering in 6UPW and 1QKR (that we guess is due to the presence of Metavinculin instead of Vinculin), that in our understanding are identical except for the absence of the leading H1 helix. * In FES calculations, since the constant force (that is, a linear bias) is applied on the same coordinate Q_‖, we expect that the resulting FES could be entirely predicted from the FES at zero force by simple addition of the linear slope, given sufficient exploration of the Q_‖ direction during the OPES-MetaD sampling. This fact could be used by the authors to assess the consistency between the FES computed at different forces. Alternatively, one may want to first aggregate the OPES-MetaD simulations at all forces using appropriate reweighting, and then estimate minimum free-energy paths and free-energy barriers at arbitrary force using the aggregated FES. This approach might lead to a better statistical use of the vast amount of simulations and a smoother estimate of the FES at all forces within the studied range. Finally, the multiple trajectories (20 replicates x 9 force values) could be used in a single bootstrap to assess the statistical uncertainty of the results (see below). * Given the coarse nature of the set of chosen CVs (Q_‖ and Q_⊥) it is unclear whether the Vt is able to regain its canonical binding site during OPES-MetaD, notably because of free rotation with respect to the actin filament. - The authors acknowledge the difficulty in the methods (sec. 5.5) without explicitly stating whether such rebinding events happen at all in their simulations. We believe this is an important piece of information for proper understanding of the FES presented. We would suggest showing time series to clarify how many binding/unbinding events are observed. - One might expect that the absence of recrossing lead to a poor estimate of the free energy difference between the bound and unbound states as well as the height of the binding free energy barrier. On the bright side, the estimate of the unbinding barrier – which is the one they are the most interested in – can still be expected to be reliable. - The authors suggest to run multiple (20) separate OPES-MetaD simulations to compensate for this limitation. It should be acknowledged that independent runs starting from the bound state will not correct for the systematic bias caused by the absence of rebinding events. A bootstrap on these replicas would anyway estimate their statistical error. - We wonder if the use of the more specific CV Q_contact might allow for such recrossing to happen within OPES-MetaD, without the need of aggregating a high number of independent trajectories. In our understanding the authors only used Q_contact to assess the robustness of the free-energy barrier height to the precise choice of the projection space, but did not try to perform OPES-MetaD directly on this CV space, which could be instructive. * The authors analyze the FES by determining a minimum free-energy path using the “String method” as a post-processing method. - The Methods section might benefit from some information about the use of the method, in particular that it is directly applied on the 2D CV-space projected FES (as opposed to a search of a minimum energy path on the full potential energy surface as originally proposed in [50]), and provide details about initialization (choice of end points for the string, number of nodes, initial interpolation) and robustness to these parameters in the converged paths and corresponding barrier estimates. - Since the FES are aggregated from 20 independent OPES-MetaD runs, it might be relatively straightforward to estimate errors (for example using bootstrapping) and provide error bars on Fig 2c. We believe this would strengthen the significance of the observed barrier difference. * One may be concerned about the significance and reliability of the constructed “Aligned” state, since this state was constructed by aligning Vt to another conformation (in what we could refer to as “docking-by-homology”) with little experimental confirmation that such a state is stable in vitro. We understand that the model constitutes the core hypothesis of the whole computational approach, and that the consistency of the computational outcomes with single-molecule experiments themselves validates its plausibility. Nevertheless, it could be argued that lower binding affinity and lifetime are to be expected from a suboptimal binding partner in a suboptimal binding pose. This raises the question of whether the proposed model corresponds to a specific binding mode in reality, or if the results could be reproduced with a different alignment. Is this ruled out by the stability observed in the 500 ns simulations shown in Fig S1? * In Sec 3.2 §4, the authors say “these results [...] do not quantitatively explain the observed experimental results, since the experimental changes in lifetime shown in Fig. 1D reflect a net 1.4 kcal/mol change in barrier in the negative direction, and 0.6 kcal/mol in the positive direction (if one assumes a constant prefactor the kinetic rate constant)”. It was somewhat unclear to us where these values come from (Are they computed from the fitted 3-state model in SI S1? At a specific value of the pulling force?) and how exactly they are compared to the computed barriers for Holo and Aligned to conclude to a discrepancy (Overestimated?) * In Sec 3.4 §3, the authors convincingly remark that in two out of five simulations of Holo+H1 state pulled towards the barbed end, the conformation of H2–H5 becomes more similar to the Aligned (unbound Vt) structure, suggesting a first step in the strong → weak allosteric transition. We wonder if (i) the specific contacts made with actin and (ii) the specific intra-domain contacts of H1 with the H2–H5 bundle are also indicative of a displacement toward the Aligned state, since this would be an even stronger argument validating the proposed model. * Given the relative simplicity of the supposed allosteric motif and the suggestive results of the Holo+H1 simulations, we cannot help but wonder whether the authors also tried to ""unfold"" the H1 helix in the Aligned model with a N-terminal pulling force since this seems a very natural test to look for equally suggestive indications of a weak → strong allosteric transition under force. * Typos or writing remarks: - Fig 1B: The caption is inconsistent with the figure. In the caption, p₁ denotes the COM of Vt helices H2–H5, p₂ the COM of actin A1/A2 and p₃ the COM of actin A4/A5. On the figure instead (p₁, p₂, p₃) → (p₃, p₁, p₂). - Some repetitions that might be elegantly avoided x “capture the difficult-to-capture” (abstract) x “protein of interest [...] on our molecule of interest” (introduction  §1) x “takes into account a Boltzmann weighted average over all possible configurations [...] a Boltzmann weighted average over all possible configurations” (introduction §4) - Typos x “FimH-manose” → “FimH-mannose” (introduction §8) x “which is the the direction” (3.1 §1) x “These approximate one-dimensional free energy pathways also give us a way to define when the system has crossed into the unfolded state” → Maybe the authors meant “unbound state” (3.1 §1) x “not all of the catch bond need come from” → “need to come from” (3.2 §3) x “we note that these results are suggestive, they do not quantitatively” → We wonder if the authors intended a formulation along the lines of: “we note that despite being suggestive, these results do not quantitatively” (3.2 §4) x “a constant prefactor the kinetic rate constant” → “a constant prefactor for the kinetic rate constant” (3.2 §4) x “grafted to our Holo structure random orientation” → “grafted to our Holo structure with a random orientation” (3.4 §2) x “TIP3 water” → “TIP3P water” (5.1 §2) Acknowledgements This report was written after a journal club given by OLC in the bussilab group meeting.

More specifically, it has been clarified that the isoformof Rap1GAP used in the EMTA does not affect nucleotide exchange and that additional evidence supports that the this system detects active Galpha(i/o). These conclusions are partially supported by evidence presented in paper that has been published (doi: 10.1126/scisignal.adi4747). ""For example, EMTA biosensors for G proteins of the Gi/o family are based on using Rap1GAP as a detector module, for which it is unclear whether it affects nucleotide exchange on different Gα subunits of this family or its preference for binding to Gα-GTP or Gα-GDP dissociated from Gβγ (35, 36), thereby raising questions about what is exactly represented by the BRET changes detected by this sensor.""",2024-11-14T15:48:57,mikelgarciamarcos,Mikel Garcia-Marcos,10.1101/2024.08.21.609006,Direct detection of endogenous Gαi activity in cells with a sensitive conformational biosensor,"Alex Luebbers, Remi Janicot, Jingyi Zhao, Clementine E.

Comparative genomics, which is an essential tool in biological research, is a very potent method that yields biological insights that are not possible with any other approach. It could also help us understand the human genome study, which has the potential to help us comprehend human sleep and sleep disorders. Phylogenomics gives a more profound comprehension of the discoveries made possible by comparative genomics. The results of this study indicate that the calcium signaling and synaptic transmission involved in sleep regulation are conserved across phyla, and a simple model organisms like Chlamydomonas may be useful in elucidating higher-order, complex behaviors such as sleep. Chlamydomonas do not possess the complexity of the sleep seen in vertebrates. However, knowing their genetic makeup can help researchers to understand general molecular processes that may be used to understand sleep in more complex organisms. Comparative phylogenomic studies are also important in understanding human sleep disorders, and they may open new avenues for developing new therapeutic approaches.",2024-11-12T14:14:42,velyudhanmohankumar,Velyudhan Mohan Kumar,10.1101/2024.11.02.621661,Cross-Kingdom Genomic Conservation of Human Sleep-Related Gene Orthologs: Phylogenomic Evidence from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,"Seithikurippu R Pandi-Perumal, Konda Mani Saravanan, Sayan Paul, George C.

For semi-isotropic pressure coupling, the tension is automatically set to zero, and does not need to be set explicitly. Why is this being done? We previously demonstrated that even ATP could bind to lipid membranes.  10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b01240. So does UMP (shown by both scattering, fluorescence and simulations ( https://doi.org/10.1039/C9S.... One caveat is that the charge on these nucleotide phosphates are most likely overestimated (see for example https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c06077 and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2021.100343.
