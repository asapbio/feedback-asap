You describe a lot of assumptions in the methods, but do not say if any effort was made to check the sensitivity of the results to particular assumptions. For that matter, were these methods pre-specified before you looked at the data, or were they tuned to the data you have? If the latter, then you may have a Type I error problem.

The only source of confusion was with the supplementary figures 1A and 1B. You stated that, ""The number of VSGs in a sample did not correlate with either the number of reads aligned or the number of parasites in a sample 1A & B)"" which I agree with but you added on to state that this was ""suggesting that sampling of each population was sufficient"" which I didn't understand. Also the labeling of the x-axes for figures 4B and 4C was really confusing. 4B- I interpreted the label as though this measurement was done in only one mouse, but then this wouldn't be possible because the mouse would have been killed on day 10 and measurements couldn't have been done on day 14. Not until I read the text section. Maybe I'd advise that you add n=4 to this figure to indicate that 4 mice were monitored for each tissue. This was the same case for 4C. Ideally, one is supposed to look at the figure and get all the necessary information from it without checking the text part of the results for more information about what the figure is communicating.",2022-10-22T02:13:33,martinakathryn,Martina Kathryn,10.1101/2022.06.27.497797,Extravascular spaces are reservoirs of antigenic diversity in Trypanosoma brucei infection,"Alexander Beaver, Nathan P.

It is my pleasure to make these remarks. The work is well structured, well researched, and properly presented, easy to read even for non-scientific audiences. When going through the details though, I could not keep the concepts of hospital-acquired infections, antibiotic resistance, and the emergence of novel diseases out of my mind, particularly because of how they are linked to the overall concept of microbial diversity and adaptability. For antimicrobial resistance, for instance, the underlying factor has everything to do with the transfer of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) between two genomes. When MGEs access the chromosomes of new bacterial hosts, the outcome is phenotypical alteration. If the MGEs contained antibiotic resistance then novel or ongoing pathogenesis may result. Nevertheless, your study has demonstrated that bacterial species rarely cross environmental barriers. However, it is interesting to note that this is not the entirety of the results because there are distinct transitions between aquatic biomes, which, noteworthy, are ancient, rare, and often directed towards the brackish biome. At the same time, there are frequent transitions into brackish sites, which are harder to explain. I am just concerned, are there tests that can ascertain these claims? Previous studies have identified that bacteria are opportunistic and may manipulate any loophole to establish supremacy. The concern is further aggravated by your additional findings, that brackish bacteria often exhibit enriched gene functions for various physiological responses, including transcriptional regulation, which is integral in the re-writing genetic information, further begging the question should there be a cause for worry.",2022-10-22T00:15:10,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2022.10.03.510577,Large-scale phylogenomics of aquatic bacteria reveal molecular mechanisms for adaptation to salinity,"Krzysztof T Jurdzinski, Maliheh Mehrshad, Luis Fernando Delgado, Ziling Deng, Stefan Bertilsson, Anders F Andersson",2022-10-03

I knew nothing about whale song before this, but your article helped me realize the mystery and variability of whale song. In addition, I noticed that this research was over two decades. I really appreciate your persistence and dedication. I don't know anything about this area before, but I'd like to leave a few comments here. I apologize if there's anything inappropriate. As for panel 2C, the figure shows the INI song type spatial gradient in transition period. But do whales stay in one place? Can there be repeated measure? Is it possible that a particular whale or group of whales was sampled twice at two adjacent sampling location? Maybe you'd like to do a short one or two sentence discussion of the impact of whale migration on data collection. Also, have you tried using some type of tracer to track a particular whale? I was wondering if you could track the song of one whale, and the songs of other whales around it. If you have data on that, I'm very curious what that looks like. For the discussion section, personally, the reading experience is not that good. I felt like so many assumptions were thrown at me that it took me some time to sort out your central idea. If I may be so bold, would you consider re-section the paragraph, or making it a little bit more concise？ Again, thank you for doing such an amazing research.

The authors identified a small molecule (ARM-1) that inhibited the RNA polymerase-associated DNA translocase Mfd, a protein shown to be involved in the development of antimicrobial resistance, and inhibited its ability to dissociate stalled RNAPs from DNA and had a modest impact on intrinsic ATPase activity of Mfd. The assays used were well suited for the study and revealed ARM-1's ability to inhibit Mfd and reduce the rate of mutation in bacteria grown in culture and during the course of infection of a human cell line. The authors also highlight that there was no detectable resistance of the bacteria to ARM-1 and that ARM-1 is able to deter the development of anitmicrobial resistance in diverse bacterial species. Only minor edits to spelling and grammar would be suggested. For example, the figure caption for Figure 4 says that the ""Concentration of ARM-1 used against S. enterica is 50 uM,"" however, S. enterica was not one of the species indicated in the figure. Overall, this manuscript represents a significant advance in the battle against antimicrobial resistance and opens the door to further studies that explore the effects of this or other similar molecules in a mammalian system during the course of infection.",2022-10-21T19:59:23,disqus_wZwaz0XRhc,Billy,10.1101/2022.09.26.509600,A small molecule that inhibits the evolution of antibiotic resistance,"Anna E.

I really hope you can address these issues before certain “news” organizations gets ahold of this. One criterion for IVGA is even spacing of cut sites, yet the SARS-CoV-2 BsaI/BsmBI fingerprint includes a tiny 643nt fragment within nsp13/helicase. This region is identical to SARS except for a single I->V mutation, so why would anyone engineering this virus want to separate this fragment to then do nothing to it? I prefer to believe this is just a cherry-picked pair of restriction enzymes and random noise. One could argue that this is similar to the less even iWIV1 cuts (Figure 2B), but iWIV1’s shortest fragment is still much larger than SARS-CoV-2’s and is only so short because of plasmid instability reported by Zeng et al. This unstable region is, however, very far from SARS-CoV-2’s short fragment, so again I see no reason why anyone would need this short fragment for engineering. Relatedly, although the longest fragment length is minimized when cuts are perfectly even spaced, statistics based on longest fragment length are not robust against tiny fragments and lead to false positives. Accounting for all fragment length by fitting to Poisson/exponential distributions would give better statistics, and I’m sure that SARS-CoV-2 would become less significant i.e. nothing in Figure 3A looks at all like Figure 2A.",2022-10-21T16:40:50,disqus_8AVEuorTBu,disqus_8AVEuorTBu,10.1101/2022.10.18.512756,Endonuclease fingerprint indicates a synthetic origin of SARS-CoV-2,"Valentin Bruttel, Alex Washburne, Antonius VanDongen",2022-10-20

I knew nothing about fin whales, so I had a lot of questions. If the public targeted by this article are not fin whale specialist, I think it could be helpful to add more information about their reproductive behavior and their immigration pattern. The question I asked myself were: Do the fine whales migrate? If they do what their migration pattern? Do they come back at the same place at the reproduction period? I think the article needs to give us the proof that population that measured overtime at different place are not the same, that there is no replacement of a group by another one, do the group get mixed? Since the authors are looking at evidence of song learning and conformity, I think it is important to ascertain that we are talking about different population across different geographic location and not the same group that would be recorded over different time period at different place. I don't think there was a tracker device, that would have help or at least it more information about the fin whale behavior during the reproduction period need to be clarify. I would suggest providing more information about the data collection, or in the discussion explain why all regions were not sampled in all years and time periods. Why was hydrophone channel used in the Canary Island, but the seismometer preferred for BBIC? The figure 4 does add any information, all seem well described by the 3 first figures. Maybe I missed, but I did not see in the discussion an explanation about the why there were no change in INI with the fin whale population in the Barents Sea. If there is no way to ascertain with this data that they were no population replacement, I would then add it in the limitation section.

The idea of inhibiting the evolution of antimicrobial resistance is fascinating and creative. And I’m very excited to see a brand-new potential solution to AMR. But I think this paper can be even better if there’s more clarification for people without rich related backgrounds. As for the abstract and introduction part, I understand that researchers chose Mfd as a target based on their previous research. But I’m curious if there is any other reason why they chose Mfd as a target? For example, if there is any other advantages of targeting Mfd. Or if there have already been studies focusing on molecules targeting Mfd so there’s already material for this research. Also, I’m curious whether there are any other possible targets for anti-evolution. Maybe going deeper into possible mechanisms of anti-evolution could help me even better understand the importance of this research. As for the methods, I believe it’s already clear enough. One thing I’m interested in but not explained in the article is that, where did the authors get these candidate compounds. Is it based on previous research or specific design. I think giving more information in this part may be helpful for clarifying the origin or differences between theses leading compounds. The figures and results are very clear and closely related to the hypothesis under testing. It may be clearer to me if the authors can briefly explain why the chose these strains of bacteria for detection. For example, for what reasons why they can be representative. The discussion part is clear and thorough. I was hoping there could be more exploration on this result. For example, I am curious whether similar target exist in other pathogens like fungi. If there are any other major limitations for this method or leading compound. Moreover, there could be more explorations on the potential further research directions since this idea is refreshing and inspiring.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.10.511625v1#comment-6018071163,biorxivstage,1,"I would like to thank Dr Crits-Christoph for his detailed critique Regarding point (3) Dr Crits-Christoph states that many of the intermediate genomes derived from a ""dataset with poor coverage, that included the vast majority of samples which had no coverage at the relevant sites."" If he has evidence of zero coverage at relevant sites in the 'vast majority of samples' then we encourage him to share it. Likewise, it would be of great utility if he could provide evidence of miscalls at positions 8782/28144 in the Sichuan/Wuhan C/C intermediate genomes. Bafflingly, Pekar et al. include over 50 genomes from the Lin et al (2021) dataset in their analysis but chose to exclude 12 C/C intermediate genomes from the same dataset (we identified 12 additional C/C intermediates that they did not consider that we note in our bioRxiv preprint). This is inconsistent with Dr Crits-Christoph's claim. that the 'vast majority...had no coverage at the relevant sites'. On what basis did they choose to retain these >50 genomes, but discard the C/C intermediates? This appears to be a clear case of selection bias. The genomes generated by Lin et al (2021) are of variable coverage - however, from their Table S2 the average % coverage with > 1 read is 95.5% (for Sichuan genomes). The likelihood is therefore that most genomes will have coverage at position 8782 (and given that all positions 28144 are called as C, it can be assumed that these all have coverage there, as Wuhan-Hu-1 has T at this position). A case in point regarding the quality of the Lin et al dataset: C/C intermediate EPI_ISL_451389 has 99.8% coverage with  > 10X read depth. This is a good quality genome therefore. Problems with the inferences made regarding claimed A and B specific SNVs in some of the C/C intermediates were discussed in: https://zenodo.org/record/7... Here is an updated summary: ' Seven intermediate genomes were excluded for possessing what were described as A, B or a combination of A and B specific SNVs.The rationale given was that these were A or B lineage genomes that acquired convergent mutations at positions 8782 and 28144 to produce C/C or T/T genotypes. However, if a B lineage genome acquired the mutation T28144C, converting it into a C/C intermediate, this would be a reversion mutation rather than a convergent mutation. In addition, no data was provided to demonstrate that a particular SNV was A or B specific. Four of the genomes had only one A or B specific (however defined) SNV (EPI_ISL_1069206 had one A specific SNV, while EPI_ISL_451390 and two unidentified genomes had one B specific SNV each). These could just as easily represent homoplasies that arose via convergence. No caveat to this effect was included in Pekar et al. Whether the remaining 3 genomes that had more than one SNV (claimed as A or B specific) are located intermediate between lineage A and lineage B genomes on a phylogenetic tree, or were phylogenetically aberrant, was not tested by the authors.' Dr Crits-Christoph claims some of the C/C intermediates are 'phylogenetically aberrant'. One way he could substantiate this is by showing this on a phylogenetic tree (remembering that homoplasies result in 'phylogenetic aberrance', indeed this is one of the manners in which they are detected). 21844 will be changed to 28144 in the next version of the preprint, thankyou for noting",2022-10-20T23:49:36,disqus_plWzQuLdvi,Steven Massey,10.1101/2022.10.10.511625,Statistical challenges for inferring multiple SARS-CoV-2 spillovers with early outbreak phylodynamics,"Alex Washburne, Adrian Jones, Daoyu Zhang, Yuri Deigin, Steven Quay, Steven E Massey",2022-10-13

However, it would be useful to provide a more detailed description of the methods, particularly to clarify the following points: Q1: The training labels are applied to 200bp bins, but the input sequences are expanded to 1Kbp centered on each bin. I'm confused about how the labels propagate when the windows are expanded. Let's say you have a negative bin that neighbors a positive bin. When you expand the 1Kbp window around the negative bin, the input sequence will encompass the positive bin. Is this 1Kbp input then labeled as positive or negative? Q2: When you split the data into training/validation/test, do you randomly choose bins or restrict them to particular chromosomes? If you randomly choose 200bp bins for your test data, won't the sequences from the test bins also be present in the training set (because of the way that windows are expanded to 1Kbp)? Q3: How were the Enformer and Basenji2 models trained? Are they trained on all data at once (i.e., multi-headed output model) or on each dataset separately? Q4: According to Supp. Table 1, most models include the following hyperparameter settings: convKnernal1st=320, convKnernal2ed=480.

In fact, they are more likely the consequence of superspreading events that occurred after introduction, such as Mardi Gras. Introductions don't cause polytomies, superspreading does. Second, you've actually made our point for us: the problem with FAVITES is precisely that it models within-host evolution while also spreading superspreading events over timescales during which within-host evolution can occur. Whereas real-world superspreading can take place in hours, FAVITES superspreading will take place over the entire infectious period. With a stationary propensity of within-host mutations, FAVITES will have a much higher probability of turning a 3-hour choir-practice superspreading event into a 9-day event (with many being extremely long, due to the exponential distribution of infectious periods in the model). This isn't a good model of superspreading-evolution of SARS-CoV-2. The genomic data for the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is not peculiar - it's exactly like the other early-outbreak polytomies you cited, and those weren't caused by spillover, they were caused by superspreading. Some of the efforts to see peculiarities in early outbreak genomes/trees are also prone to observer bias. I can look at a license plate in front of me - NGK 190 - and say ""what are the odds of *exactly* that? I can run a null model of license plates and say ""basically no chance of that"". Then, I can make a license plate that's restricted in my favor. It'll have a much higher odds of NGK 190. That doesn't mean my new model is right. It means my initial probabilistic assessment of an unusual feature I picked up is prone to observer bias.

Review synthesized by Ruchika Bajaj. This study has developed a novel one-step methodology for the incorporation of membrane proteins from cells to lipid Salipro nanoparticles for structure-function studies using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), which is a profound technology in the field of membrane protein structural biology. We raise some points that may strengthen the manuscript below: Main section, 4th paragraph  “ resuspended in digitoxin-containing buffer ”- Does the sentence mean that membrane proteins were solubilized by detergent before reconstitution into salipro particles? Are salipro and digitoxin added at the same step? If this is the case, it is unclear how one can distinguish between the step wise solubilization and reconstitution or direct reconstitution into salipro particles. Further discussion on the mechanism of reconstitution would be helpful. In the same paragraph, the fragment “to increase membrane fluidity and render lipids” raises the question of whether the concentration of digitonin was optimized to balance the increase in membrane fluidity but not rendering the solubilization of membrane proteins. Main section, 4th paragraph, “ the formation of saponin-containing mPANX1-GFP particles was assessed by analytical size exclusion chromatography using fluorescence detector ” -  It is assumed that fluorescence is detected from GFP. As the construct expressed is PANX1-GFP, GFP fluorescence signal will be received from reconstituted as well as not reconstituted PANX1. Is saponin specific signal being used as a signal for measuring the reconstitution of PANX1-GFP? In the same paragraph, “ PreScission protease for on-column cleavage ” is mentioned. Is GFP still intact in the expressed PANX-1 or is it cleaved? A diagram of these procedures showing the various steps will be helpful for readers. Main section, 4th paragraph “ SDS-PAGE revealed the formation of pure and homogeneous Salipro-mPANX1 nanoparticles ”- However, extra bands are present above the major band in Figure 1E, can some comment be provided on this point. Possible explanations for the additional bands could be post translational modifications or degradation of mPANX1. Methodology section, “ membrane protein reconstitution screening using fluorescence-detection size exclusion chromatography (FSEC)” -The amount of salipro is given in ug. A comment on the ratio of protein to salipro particles would be important to decide the concentration of salipro with respect to the mass of the cell pellet. Figure 1G: The molecular weight of Salipro-mPANX1 particles is mentioned to be approximately 466kD. mPANX1 weighs about 48kD and heptamer will be 336kDa. A discussion on comparison of experimental and actual molecular weight would be interesting. hPANX1 was expressed in sf9 insect cells. A description regarding trials of expression of this construct in expi293 cells would be informative. Supplemental Figure 1B: The gel is overloaded and shows multiple bands for hPANX1, recommend selecting an alternative image for hPANX. Paragraph 6A phrase, “challenged with bezoylbenzoyl-ATP(bzATP), spironolactone and cabenoxolone ” - Please explain the meaning of ‘challenged’ here. Supplementary Figure 2: Paragraph 6 mentions “ binding constant could not be determined ”. Please provide an explanation for this. Is it about the saturation phase not being approachable because of the feasibility of the binding experiment at higher concentration of cabenoxolone? The last summary sentence in Paragraph 6 is not clear, recommend rephrasing it. Figure 2A shows that Salipro particles have His tag. This suggests that an additional step of affinity purification with His tag could have been used to distinguish or separate reconstituted and un-reconstituted PANX1. Supplementary figure 4: Please explain whether the datasets for samples in the presence and absence of fluorinated lipids were combined together. Paragraph 8, “ intracellular helices were not well resolved ” - Please comment on a possible explanation. Does the Salipro scaffold contribute to the resolution? Please mention any future possibilities regarding improving the resolution by modifying the salipro scaffold or alternative scaffold. In the same paragraph, rmsd is mentioned at promoter level, please comment on how this value changes at heptamer level and why is it important to report the rmdd value to appreciate the direct reconstitution methodology. Last paragraph 10, “future membrane protein research” - Please comment on the utility of this methodology on prokaryotic membrane proteins, bacterial outer or inner membrane proteins or eukaryotic membrane proteins. Some more examples of reconstitution with the same method will support the applicability of this methodology on diverse kinds of membrane proteins.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.10.511625v1#comment-6014068497,biorxivstage,2,"In this preprint, Washburrne and colleagues put forth some reasoning and basic analysis that they believe suggests the viral genomic data from the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is consistent with a single spillover event. This is in contrast to the work of Pekar et al. 2022 Science, which concluded that the genomic data from the early pandemic is best explained by multiple independent spillover events from an animal population. However, this preprint misrepresents the findings of Pekar et al. 2022, and makes several conceptual errors that fundamentally undermine their conclusions. There are 4 basic features of the early SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny that are each largely inconsistent with a single spillover event: A Lineage A ancestral haplotype is inconsistent with the molecular clock: Lineage B exhibits more divergence from the root of the tree than would be expected if lineage A were the ancestral virus in humans (Pekar Fig S20, S19). Two basal polytomies of lineages A and B were formed at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, whereas most single introductions within a city, location, or event are characterized by a single polytomy. There are no plausible candidates for intermediate genomes observed for lineages A and B. Both Lineage A and Lineage B are connected to and were present during the outbreak at the Huanan Seafood Market, and there was sustained case transmission within the market for up to a month. The authors have *attempted* (unsuccessfully) to address points 2 and 3, but they have entirely ignored points 1 and 4, which are still highly pertinent. All four of these observations need to be explained by any hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 origins. Now, on to specific scientific errors in this work: 1. In the first section, the authors describe how superspreading events can create polytomies, as do introduction events. This is an intuitive observation, as both superspreading events and successful introductions can result from rapid transmission from a singular infection source. What they fail to note, however, is that superspreading events and introduction events are characterized by a single polytomy, not by two. Here is a simple list of introduction/superspreading events characterized by a single polytomy: New Zealand https://www.nature.com/arti... Lombardy https://www.nature.com/arti... Louisiana (Mardi Gras superspreading event) https://www.sciencedirect.c... Xinfadi market in Beijing https://academic.oup.com/ns... In none of the above cases of introduction/superspreader events do we observe two basal polytomies separated by two mutations with no intermediates as we do for early SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. Ironically, the authors cite Popa et al. 2020 Nature Communications on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria as an example of how polytomies can be linked to superspreader events. However, this work elegantly describes how each polytomy results from a separate introduction event into Austria: Vienna-1 clade/polytomy: connected to an index patient from Italy. Tyrrol-1 clade/polytomy: phylogenetically linked to North America. Vienna-3 clade/polytomy: connected to Cluster OG, an independent travel-associated cluster. Tyrrol-3 clade/polytomy: connected to Cluster D, an independent travel-associated cluster. So indeed, the cited work is actually more strong evidence that introduction events — including those of a ‘superspreader’ nature — are characterized by a single polytomy. We see no instances of a single superspreader event creating two concurrent polytomies, separated by two or more mutations, as we observe with the rise of lineages A and B in Wuhan. It is not merely the existence of polytomies in a phylogeny that is relevant, but the observed ratio of polytomy frequency and size, which Pekar et al. simulations predict would arise very infrequently with a single introduction. Further, the authors are incorrect in their characterization of the FAVITES models used by Pekar et al. FAVITES has been modified to accurately recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 superspreading nature; see Worobey et al. 2020 Science, Figure S2. Washburne et al. say: “and the transmission model of FAVITES will extend superspreading events over timescales that within-host evolution can occur”. However, the simulations in Pekar et al., 2022, and in FAVITES more broadly, account for within-host evolution: the coalescent process and subsequent mutational evolution are agnostic to subsampling and within-host evolution. 2. In the second section, the authors describe how ascertainment biases and biased contact tracing could affect the recovered phylogeny. The core conceptual errors here are namely: The lineage A/B split and the basal polytomies of SARS-CoV-2 are still obvious in any phylogeny of early SARS-CoV-2 even when excluding genomes from the city of Wuhan: this phylogenetic structure is factually not an artifact of sampling, and anyone is welcome to build a tree of sequences before April 2020 excluding those from Wuhan and demonstrate this. Likewise, lineage A is still incompatible with the molecular clock when genomes linked to the Huanan Market are excluded. Even in sequences from February 2020 can you see a ‘lag’ in the evolution of lineage A from its root compared to lineage B (Pekar Fig S20). The authors propose no explanation of how contact tracing of patients connected to one market could produce a phylogenetic artifact of two large, basal polytomies: indeed, their simple analysis in Fig 2 shows that contact tracing will preferentially sample just one lineage, not two. Small polytomies are common throughout the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. A contact tracing bias cannot explain a lack of intermediate genomes between lineages A and B into itself. Firstly, if the evolution between the lineages occurred in humans, the patients with intermediate genomes should be contact traceable from normal lineage B patients. Second, even if they were missed in Wuhan, we would see the phylogenetic descendents of the intermediate genotype spread to other countries, unless this lineage just happened to be wiped out very quickly. As discussed by the Worobey et al. 2021 Science perspective, several of the earliest known SARS-CoV-2 patients were emphatically not contact traced from others — they were independently noticed in different hospitals throughout the city. This includes the earliest known case of lineage A, who was not contact traced, and had no noted connection to the Huanan Seafood Market, but after the fact was realized to live just a few blocks away (and shopped at a nearby market). Several other data points that together point towards the known early case data in Wuhan not being strongly characterized by ascertainment bias are discussed in the supplementary text of Worobey et al. 2022 Science section on this topic. 3. In the third section, the authors put forth the possibility that several sampled genomes were intermediate sequences of lineage A and lineage B. Again here, they both misunderstand the data that they are reporting on, and misconstrue the methods and findings of Pekar et al. They propose that a set of genomes obtained from Sichuan may constitute C/C intermediate haplotypes between lineages A and B. However, the data does not support this, as elegantly explained by Zach Hensel on Twitter: https://twitter.com/alchemy... https://twitter.com/alchemy... Washburne writes: ""It is difficult to see how sequencing errors, which are random, could occur at exactly the same position in these 12 early outbreak genomes."" However, what they do not understand is that several of these genomes were plagued by systematic bioinformatics errors, not random sequencing errors. This was likely due to a known issue with a pipeline that imputed the reference genotype in loci with no read support, instead of replacing those positions with N characters. As demonstrated by Hensel above, for this particular dataset with poor coverage, that included the vast majority of samples which had no coverage at the relevant sites. Further, the authors misunderstand why certain genomes have been excluded from Pekar et al. The deciding observation is not the quality of the underlying sequencing data — although that is certainly likely the hidden cause — but the observation that some genomes share multiple polymorphisms with derived lineages in A and B, strongly indicating that they are phylogenetically aberrant. In all scenarios in which underlying data are available, it has been confirmed that these phylogenetic outliers are plagued by poor data quality issues, with missing data that has often been incorrectly imputed. In cases without the underlying data, the only alternative explanation would have to be a highly unusual degree of recurrent mutations. As this is fully explained in Pekar et al. 2022, I highly suggest the authors attempt a re-read to understand the reasoning of how we can identify these incorrect genomes. There are two more “minor” (in the grand scheme of things) errors in this section: “Lineage A and Lineage B, are separated by only two defining single nucleotide changes (SNCs), at positions 8782 and 21844” This is incorrect - the second position should be 28144, not 21844. This is wrong throughout the manuscript. ""Intermediate sequences suggest there may not be two basal polytomies"" Polytomies can be separated by a single mutation and still be polytomies: there is a basal polytomy in lineage A, and a separate basal polytomy in lineage B. The existence of intermediate genomes would not preclude the presence of these two polytomies. In sum, neither of the three points raised by Washburne and colleagues are in fact relevant to the hypothesis of multiple spillovers of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, it is also important to briefly discuss a broader conceptual error made by the authors. As they write: ""Far from being able to conclude two spillover events, both hypotheses - natural origin and lab origin - are still on the table."" This quote (along with knowledge of their past works) makes evident the aim of the authors: to reject the possibility of multiple SARS-CoV-2 spillovers because it is a finding largely inconsistent with their preferred laboratory origin hypothesis. They are correct in thinking that multiple spillovers of SARS-CoV-2 cannot easily be explained by a hypothesis of laboratory emergence. They are, however, incorrect in their statement that a lack of evidence for multiple spillovers would “put the lab origin hypothesis on the table”. There is an astounding degree of evidence against the possibility of laboratory emergence, primarily: (1) the complete lack of epidemiological contacts traced to the WIV, and the March 2020 seronegativity of Shi Zhengli’s group, (2) the geographic epicenter of the pandemic was in Hankou, Wuhan, not Wuchang, where the WIV resides, (3) the detailed insight we have into the research ongoing at the WIV in 2018-2019, including CoV sequences submitted to GenBank in 2018 (Yu Ping et al.) and Latinne et al. 2020 (submitted Oct 6 2019), multiple publicly available theses and papers, interviews, collaborator emails, US intelligence investigations, and unfunded grant proposals: all of which has so far indicated a lack of a SARS-CoV-2 progenitor at WIV, (4) the preponderance of evidence from the known early cases within the city of Wuhan, which were either linked to or centered around the Huanan Seafood Market, including the very first cases first identified in hospitals as reported by independent journalists as described in Worobey 2021 Science perspective, (5) the positive viral samples from an animal cage, a freezer, a defeathering machine, and the drains and ground of wildlife selling stalls within the western half of the Huanan Seafood Market, the half to which most human cases were also linked, and (6) direct and geographic links of patients and environmental sampling firmly establishing that both early SARS-CoV-2 lineages A and B were first identified in connection to the Huanan Seafood Market. Put otherwise, it is clear that the authors misrepresent and misunderstand the reasons why multiple spillovers have been proposed. Contrary to their beliefs, it is not to undermine or reject the laboratory hypothesis. The clear evidence against that hypothesis is well described in Holmes et al. 2021 Cell, The WHO Mission Report, and Worobey et al. 2022 Science— it is entirely incidental that the likelihood of multiple spillovers also happens to be inconsistent with their hypothesis. Why then has the possibility of multiple spillovers been proposed? Because the genomic data from the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is *peculiar*, and these peculiarities have so far only been adequately explained by models incorporating multiple spillovers. It is as simple as that.",2022-10-16T16:15:13,acc_account,Alex Crits-Christoph,10.1101/2022.10.10.511625,Statistical challenges for inferring multiple SARS-CoV-2 spillovers with early outbreak phylodynamics,"Alex Washburne, Adrian Jones, Daoyu Zhang, Yuri Deigin, Steven Quay, Steven E Massey",2022-10-13

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.29.510055v1#comment-6012114750,biorxivstage,1,"Dr. Sarris, I am glad you have responded to the comments and are willing to discuss this topic further. I hope this will lead to better science and investigation into this phenomenon. If the goal was to attract attention with a provocative title and discussion, then you achieved this. Unfortunately the field of nitrogen fixation has a long history of claims of diazotorphy that have turned out to be false. So I hope you did not interpret my comments as doubting your expertise but more of a need for due diligence in a field with a bumpy history. I believe this manuscript and study need to be written in a way that will convince absolutely anyone with doubt. Therefore it does not hurt to be extremely specific when explaining the methods. For example, I commented on multiple-replatings because, as I read the methods, endophytes were isolated on nutrient agar and then directly plated on three different Glucose nitrogen-free media. Only on Page 4 line 23 do you describe “multiple generations” do you mean multiple transfers? If so, how many? And yes, I agree that if nitrogen contamination had been an issue, more of the isolates would have grown. I think this is important and should be stated in the manuscript. Again, to prove this phenomenon is real, I would suggest the most extreme caution and test with noble agar or agarose. It might also be helpful before this goes into an official review to repeat the growth on N-free media at a different facility just in case of contamination in water or other materials. Some bacteria can use ammonia from the air! So everything needs to be considered. ( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.j... For the N2 consumption assay, I think it would be communicated more clearly if the assay was reported in mol of N2/ min or hr/ mg of protein or colony-forming units to standardize and compare to other nitrogen-fixing organisms. Again, this will be doable without repeating the experiment if you have a standard curve. I am glad you measured the overall pressure change in each experiment, this should be stated in the methods. I think it might be beneficial to try with a majority argon atmosphere to see if a similar phenomenon occurs. It could test if the partial pressure of nitrogen affects the overall nitrogen fixation rate, suggesting if this is an enzymatic reaction with low Km. Also, a growth curve with nitrogen-free media in an argon atmosphere vs. N2 only atmosphere would be a compelling experiment. The comment that this dinitrogen consumption is occurring on ammonia-supplemented media might be a clue to what is happening. This is an exciting point that a constitutive process is consuming atmospheric dinitrogen in yeast. All known diazotrophs have a strict regulatory system to turn off nitrogen fixation when any fixed nitrogen is present. Therefore I believe it is essential to show the nitrogen-free assays as well. If you have the same nitrogen fixation rate in both ammonia-supplemented and nitrogen-free, this would be very interesting to determine what is limiting growth. All of these questions should be addressed in the manuscript. While we must think outside of prokaryotic nitrogen fixation, basic thermodynamics still apply. Therefore, no matter what, this reaction is highly energy intensive. From what I know, breaking the dinitrogen triple bond is the highest activation energy in biology. So I would fight back on the idea that this might not be a high energy-consuming process. This also brings questions to the previous observation of a constitutive reaction. In this topic, I also don’t want to discredit yeast and especially the peroxisomes. While I am no expert, I know some extreme chemistry goes on in peroxisomes, and the potential for dinitrogen to be oxidized to nitrite might be possible in them. Inorganic chemistry has shown oxidation of dinitrogen with a catalyst can happen, and we know life always finds a way! While I can easily google nitrogen fixation in yeast and get two papers from 1911 and 1954,  I can also easily google dozens of papers in he past 10 years that grow Saccharomyces cerevisiae under nitrogen limiting conditions. This is something you will have to justify in your manuscripts if you want to claim cerevisiae is using dinitrogen as its nitrogen source. For the PCR assay, I am just commenting on the gel itself and would hope to see a brighter band for the positive control. Also, it could be helpful once you get the Azotobacter strain to run nifH as another control to detect any prokaryotic diazotrophs. I hope to see you proceed with the N15 and the other controls. I would love to see a nitrogen-fixing eukaryote, but I am afraid it will require much more evidence for me to be convinced.

The results are really important specifically for rod-shaped bacteria and also an important contribution to the broader field of understanding cell shape. Specifically, I love that they are distinguishing between labile and non-labile intracellular magnesium pools, as well as extracellular magnesium! These three pools are really challenging to separate but I commend them on engaging with this topic and using it to provide alternative explanations for their observations! A major contribution to prior findings on the effects of magnesium is the author’s ability to visualize the number of septa in the elongating cells in the absence of magnesium. This is novel information and I think the field will benefit from the microscopy data shown here. I completely agree with the authors that we need to be more careful when using rich media such as LB. It is particularly sad that we may be missing really interesting biology because of that! It’s worth moving away from such media or at least being more careful about batch to batch variability. Batch to batch variability is not as well appreciated in microbiology as it is for growing other cell types (for example, mammalian cells and insect cells). For me, the most exciting finding was that a large part of the cell length changes within the first 10min after adding magnesium. The authors do speculate in the discussion that this is likely happening because of biophysical or enzymatic effects, and I hope they explore this further in the future! I love how the paper reads like a novel! Congratulations on a very well-written paper! Kudos to the authors for providing many alternative explanations for their results. It demonstrates critical thinking and an open-mind to finding the truth.

It would be helpful to have Western blot data showing that the particular proteins are actually being overexpressed. I think the phenotypes that you observe are very compelling, so I don’t doubt the conclusions. Western blot data would just provide some additional confirmation that you are actually achieving overexpression of UppS, MraY, and BcrC. Response The proteins are untagged. For the UppS and BcrC the cell shortening occurs with addition of inducer, , so strong indication expression is occurring. A western would provide information about degree of overexpression, but we don’t think is necessary to support conclusion drawn. Do you think there is an alternative possibility that needs to be excluded? We note that in another preprint ( https://www.biorxiv.org/con... the authors delete the native uppS in their inducible Phy-uppS strain (Fig S4) and at 100 uM IPTG (10X less than what we used in experiment) the cells have wt growth on LB plates, so we at least know the Phy-uppS is functional and made (or they would die!). We are introducing the uppS deletion into our strain to see if we can identify a concentration of IPTG that doesn’t affect cell growth but still induces shortening. For MraY, the result is negative, so you are spot on – it is impossible to tell if due to lack of overexpression from data shown. We only know the strain is correctly made from sequencing. We will investigate if there is an antibody or functional fusion available. The reason we were not sure was worth doing is because the MraY reaction is reversible (15131133). This means that without a phenotype, there is no simple way to know the reaction can even be pushed forward even if the overexpression is confirmed (more negative data). We actually overexpressed some other proteins that act downstream (MraY, MurJ, AmJ) and they were also negative for shortening. Probably we should remove the negative data or reword to make the caveats of the negative result clear. Question Based on your data, there are definitely differences in gene expression when you compare cells grown in media with and without magnesium. Because the majority in cell length increase occurs in such a short time though (the first 10min), I was wondering if you think that some or most of it is not due to gene expression? Response The shortening is even faster than 10 min (not only statistically significant, but also obvious qualitatively if we mount immediately after adding Mg2+ ). We did not include the first timepoint because original purpose was to check everything was ready with microscope – did not expect shortening so fast! We can definitely add that data in. When we saw, we tried to capture the transition on pads, but going from culture to pad seems to stress the cells too much in the small window where the cool stuff happens. Since growth rate doesn’t appear to be a big factor in those initial divisions, we might be able to grow at lower temp and shift to pads for adjustment period before adding Mg2+. Did not play with it much due to lack of resources atm, but a flowcell setup would probably be best. In short, we think rapid divisions right after transition do not require transcription or translation. It really “smells” more like a biophysical thing. Question Do you have any hypotheses what is most likely to be affected by magnesium? Do you think if the membrane may be affected? Response We have a lot of hypotheses – all of which are speculative. There could be an extracytoplasmic enzyme involved in envelope synthesis is sensitive to Mg2+ availability, and that at lower concentrations, it’s activity is affected. There is some old literature with membrane preps that suggests PG synthesis requires higher Mg2+ than teichoic acid synthesis. If Und-P is limiting, higher Mg2+ may shift make the pool more available to make the septum. Tingfeng initially hypothesized there might be a receptor/signal mechanism but has not been able to identify one. Und-P seems to be important, but “availability” is not just pool, but how fast (and where!) the flipping across the membrane occurs. If Und-PP needs to be dephosphorylated to Und-P before being flipped back to cytoplasmic side, anything that effects the PPi equilibrium would be predicted to affect the reaction rate, with lower Pi (in periplasm or pseudoperiplasm in case of G+) favoring the dephosphorylation. Cell wall associated Mg2+ could shift equilibrium to be more favorable for a Und-PP phosphatase more closely associated with the divisome. I could go all day… In short, we don’t know enough! Question Why do you think less magnesium activates this program of less division and more elongation? Additionally why is abundant magnesium activating a program of increased cell division and less elongation? Do you think there is some evolutionary advantage, especially considering how important magnesium is for ATP production? Response In the window we looked at, the elongation rate is constant (not less or more) and only the division frequency changes. Some bacteria (like Caulobacter and to lesser extent E. coli) clearly elongate and divide simultaneously, so there is some competition for substrate (like Lipid II). Septators like Bacillus seem to delineate the two processes more, but we have found conditions where even Bacillus invaginates during division, so it’s not absolute. Like eukaryotic cells, bacterial undoubtedly have mechanisms not only commit to a round of DNA replication when there is some signal that resources are sufficient. Clearly with some bugs, this is not the case with cell division. The alternative possibility is that every cell cycle there is an opportunity to divide if some threshold of *something(s)* is reached. There is a hypothesis from Mtb literature that it may be GTP, but it’s not at all clear that is sufficient. In yeast, size at cell division is affected by perturbing 1-C pool. Question Related to this previous question, I also wonder if this magnesium-dependent phenotype would extend to other unicellular organisms, may be protists or algae? That would be a really exciting direction to explore! Response It’s a great question – lots to do! We didn’t even look at another Gram-positive, but we plan to. It’s trickier to limit Mg2+ in Gram-negatives (see 27471053 – we tried Bsub homolog for those wondering – it’s not responsible for phenotype we see). Question Regarding the zinc and manganese experiments, why do you think they lead to additional phenotypes compared to magnesium? Do you have any hypotheses? Response We have hypotheses, but if my (Jen’s) twitter engagement is any indication, way too speculative for public consumption at present. Need grant to acquire preliminary data to write grant. Question Regarding your results that Lipid I availability may be a major a problem for the cell division in the absence of magnesium, do you think that is due to effects magnesium has on the enzymes directly, or do you think magnesium affects the substrate availability/conformation by coordinating the phosphate groups? Or something else, may be membrane conformation? Response Several proteins involved in envelope synthesis (like UppS) are Mg2+ dependent enzymes. But at least for any intracellular players, levels of Mg2+ should be more than high enough to support enzyme activity even when levels are low (0.8 – 3.0 mM is Bsub range I recall off top of head). Could have impact extracytoplasmically by lowering pool sponged into the cell wall, but intuition (for what that is worth) is that it is not the coordination of an enzyme with a metal that is impacted rather the equilibrium with other ions like Pi and H+ and that this impacts net ATP synthesis. Lots to think about and do, and no simple answers. When Tingfeng started project idea was to find mechanism – didn’t realize we were asking “how does the cell work?” Turned out to be a bit much for a dissertation project :) -Jen Herman and Tingfeng Guo",2022-10-13T19:16:01,bacillusbarosh,BacillusBaRosh,10.1101/2022.10.01.510448,Magnesium modulates Bacillus subtilis cell division frequency,"Tingfeng Guo, Jennifer K.

I'm particularly surprised that the RGA5 HMA domain in Pikm-1 was not tolerated by Pikm-2 considering the fact that nanobody domains can be incorporated into Pikm-1 and coexpressed with Pikm-2 with some success. Do these seemingly contradictory results surprise you? Do you think there is something special about the nanobody structure that makes it a good replacement for the HMA domain in Pikm-1? Do you think coexpression of Pikp-2 with Pikm-1 pikobodies would result in less autoactivity?,2022-10-13T12:53:12,ryankessens,Ryan Kessens,10.1101/2022.10.10.511592,Allelic compatibility in plant immune receptors facilitates engineering of new effector recognition specificities,"Adam R.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.500229v1#comment-6006954805,biorxivstage,0,"This paper aims to understand how toxin-antidote (TA) elements are spread and maintained in species, especially in species where outcrossing is infrequent and the selfish gene drive of TA elements is limited. The paper focuses on the possible fitness costs and benefits of the peel-1/zeel-1 element in the nematode C. elegans. A combination of mathematical modeling and experimental tests of fitness are presented. The authors make a surprising finding: the toxin gene peel-1 provides a fitness advantage to the host. This is a very interesting finding that challenges how we think about selfish genetic elements, demonstrating that they may not be wholly “selfish” in order to spread in a population. This paper is of interest to evolutionary biologists and population geneticists. It provides empirical evidence that supports a previous hypothesis of how selfish toxin-antidote elements spread in non-obligate outcrossing species. While the experiments and data are appropriate for addressing this hypothesis, one major conclusion is not supported by the data and one other major conclusion is supported only weakly. Strengths 1. The authors support results found with a zeel-1 peel-1 introgressed strain by using CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to precisely knock-out the genes of interest. They were careful to ensure the loss-of-function of these generated alleles by using genetic crosses. 2. Similarly, the authors are careful with controls, ensuring that genetic markers used in the fitness assays did not affect the fitness of the strain. This ensures that the genes of interest are causative for any source of fitness differences between strains, therefore making the data reliable and easily interpretable. 3. A powerful assay for directly measuring the relative fitness of two strains is used. 4. The authors support relative fitness data with direct measurements of fitness proximal traits such as body size (a proxy for growth rate) and fecundity, providing further support for the conclusion that peel-1 increases fitness. Weaknesses 1. One major conclusion is that peel-1 increases fitness independent of zeel-1, but this claim is not well supported by the data. The data presented show that the presence of zeel-1 does not provide a fitness benefit to a peel-1(null) worm. But the experiment does not test whether zeel-1 is required for the increased fitness conferred by the presence of peel-1. Ideally, one would test whether a zeel-1(null);peel-1(+) strain is as fit as a zeel-1(+);peel-1(+) strain, but this experiment may be infeasible since a zeel-1(null);peel-1(+) strain is inviable. 2. The CRISPR-generated peel-1 allele in the N2 background only accounts for 32% of the fitness difference of the introgressed strain. Thus, the effect of peel-1 alone on fitness appears to be rather small. Additionally, this effect of peel-1 shows only weak statistical significance (and see point 5 below). Given that this is the key experiment in the paper, the major conclusion of the paper that the presence of peel-1 provides a fitness benefit is supported only weakly. For example, it is possible that other mutations caused by off-target effects of CRISPR in this strain may contribute to its decreased fitness. It would be valuable to point out the caveats to this conclusion, or back it up more strongly with additional experiments such as rescuing the peel-1(null) fitness defect with a wild-type peel-1 allele or determining if introduction of wild-type peel-1 into the introgressed strain is sufficient to confer a fitness benefit. 3. The strain that introgresses the zeel-1 peel-1 region from CB4856 into the N2 background was made by a different lab. Given that N2 strains from different labs can vary considerably, it is unclear whether this introgressed strain is indeed isogenic to the N2 strain it is competed against, or whether other background mutations outside the introgressed region may contribute to the observed fitness differences. 4. Though the CRISPR-generated null allele of peel-1 only accounts for 32% of the fitness difference of the zeel-1 peel-1 introgressed strain, these two strains have very similar fecundity and growth rates. Thus, it is unclear why this mutant does not more fully account for the fitness differences. 5. Improper statistical tests are used. All comparisons use a t test, but this test is inappropriate when multiple comparisons are made. Importantly, correction for multiple comparisons may decrease the already weak statistical significance of the fitness costs of the peel-1 CRISPR allele (Fig 3E), which is the key result in the paper. 6. N2 fecundity and growth rate measurements from Fig 2B&C are reused in Fig 3C&D. This should be explicitly stated. It should also be stated whether all three strains (N2, the zeel-1 peel-1 introgressed strain, and the peel-1 CRISPR mutant) were assayed in parallel as they should be. If so, a statistical test that corrects for multiple comparisons should also be used. 7. It appears that the same data for the controls for the fitness experiments (i.e. N2 vs. marker & N2 vs. introgressed npr-1; glb-5) may be reused in Fig 2A and 3E. If so, this should be stated. It should also be stated whether all the experiments in these panels were performed in parallel. If so, this may affect the statistical significance when correcting for multiple comparisons. Minor points 1. Though the mathematical modeling is interesting from a theoretical point of view, we feel that it oversells the rationale behind the experiments, setting up a “straw man” argument to knock down. Also, the modeling relies on rather high assumptions of the possible carrying cost of peel-1/zeel-1. For example, the modeling of the effect of outcrossing rate on peel-1/zeel-1 frequency assumes a selection coefficient of 0.35, which seems rather arbitrary and high. Where does this number come from? Is there any precedence for this high carrying cost? In our opinion, the idea that energy expenditure or leaky toxicity accounts for such a high carrying cost seems unlikely. 2. The two studies cited for “outcrossing rates typical for C. elegans” estimated vastly different outcrossing rates (~20% or ~1%). The model presented in Fig S1 specifically uses the lower estimates (0-2%), so the Sivasundar & Hey paper is miscited here. It is unclear whether there is a good rationale to go with the lower rate estimates. 3. The measurement of body-size is unclear in the main text. Only when reading methods did we realize that body-size is more of a proxy for growth rate rather than an end-point measurement of worm size. 4. What is the temporal distribution of egg laying of the N2 and N2peel-1(null) strains? Based on how the data collection is described in the Methods, the authors should already have these data. Does egg-laying start at the same time in the two strains? The fact that strains carrying peel-1 grow faster but also apparently produce more sperm (which might slow them down) makes an analysis of this worthwhile, especially since fitness depends on when eggs are laid, not just how many. Some more characterization of this fitness trait seems appropriate and useful for beginning to understand how peel-1 may be increasing fitness. Given that the number of sperm limits how many eggs are laid, the presence of peel-1 apparently results in more sperm. It is surprising that a gene exclusively expressed in developing sperm can lead to production of more sperm. 5. Line 65: the statement “similar elements have not been identified in obligate outcrossing Caenorhabditis nematodes” is somewhat misleading. TA elements may not have been identified in obligate outcrossing nematodes because of research bias since genetic experiments are easier to perform in non-obligate outcrossers and it is unclear that there have been extensive searches for TA elements in outcrossing nematodes. Furthermore, as the mathematical models in this study suggest, TA elements will spread quickly with increasing rate of outcrossing. Since a TA element’s non-fixation within a species has historically been a prerequisite for its discovery, the rapid TA element fixation that would generally occur in obligate outcrossers would make their identification more challenging. 6. Line 209-210: it is stated that this is the “first measurement of the fitness cost of a TA element to the host” and “first demonstration that a TA element can benefit the organism.” These claims may be overstated. It has been previously shown in several cases that TA elements can provide fitness benefits in bacteria, such as improved antibiotic resistance (e.g. Bogati et al. 2022, PMID: 34570627). 7. More details about the CRISPR protocol would be helpful. It is unclear whether Cas9/sgRNAs were introduced as RNPs or plasmids (and at what concentrations). It is unclear how worms were screened for edits. It is also unclear how many Dpy or Rol worms were screened and how many peel-1 or zeel-1 edited worms were found (the efficiency of CRISPR). The meaning of the shaded portion of the repairing oligo sequences in the table is not explained. Finally, it is not stated whether CRISPR-generated mutant strains were outcrossed.

Review synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. The preprint studied the conformational changes upon binding of the Akt protein kinase to the Akt active site inhibitor A-443654 and the Akt allosteric inhibitor MK-2206, under three states of Akt: inactive monophosphorylated, partially active tris-phosphorylated, and fully activated, tris-phosphorylated bound to PIP3 membranes. The MK-2206 resulted in allosteric conformational changes in all states and restricted membrane binding through sequestration of the PH domain. The A-443654 inhibitor led to allosteric conformational changes in the monophosphorylated and phosphorylated states, with increased protection in the PH domain upon membrane binding. The results can assist the design of Akt-targeted therapeutics. The reviewers had a few minor comments about the paper: It could be helpful to include a short explanation early in the text about the use of HDX-MS, how it works and why it is useful for exploring conformational changes.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.16.473032v2#comment-6005651228,biorxivstage,1,"This manuscript investigates the cellular basis of reduced insulin secretion in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) by generating several independent INS-1-derived cell lines to model PWS. These PWS model cells have reduced insulin secretion and reduced levels of insulin and several other secreted peptides. A possible mechanism is suggested by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, demonstrating the reduced expression of a number of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones that may be important for proper folding of insulin; reduced levels of chaperones may lead to reductions in insulin levels, though it should be emphasized that this is just a model and hasn’t been tested. The experiments are performed well and the data are solid and convincing, though the effect sizes are of rather small magnitude and it is unclear how important the small effects seen here are to the pathophysiology of PWS. The extensive and rigorous molecular characterization of the mutations in the PWS model cell lines is a particular strength, and the fact that several independent PWS and control cell lines are generated increases the confidence in the results. The proteomic and transcriptomic datasets generated in this work are important contributions to the field. We have a number of relatively minor critiques, many related to the writing and presentation of the work. Specific comments: 1.	Though the data appear to be solid, virtually all of the effects are of small magnitude, < 2 fold (e.g. insulin secretion, altered expression of chaperones at both the mRNA and protein levels, ER-stress sensitivity). This is fine, but is not readily apparent from the way the paper is written (e.g. line 389, where insulin secretion is described as “dramatically reduced” or elsewhere where effect sizes can only be gleaned by careful examination of the figures). More transparency and explicit discussion of the effect sizes would be helpful. For instance, it would be helpful to compare the effect sizes seen here to those of PWS mouse models and human patients. 2.	The take-home model of the paper is that the effect on insulin in PWS is due to an indirect effect on chaperones. This is a reasonable and interesting model, but given that the magnitude of the downregulation of these chaperones is actually quite small (appears to be less than 2-fold for most or all of them), it seems possible that some other mechanism is at play and this may be a red herring. It is unclear whether such a modest decrease in multiple chaperones would produce the observed effects on insulin content and secretion, though it is an interesting question for future work. However, it would also be nice to see the full lists of proteomic data presented as supplementary tables for interested readers so possible alternative targets can be more easily explored. 3.	It is concluded that PWS cells are unable to compensate for decreases in chaperones because many chaperones are simultaneously downregulated. This argument does not make a lot of sense to us, and would seem to depend on the mechanism of compensation, which is not further described here. For example, if chaperone genes are transcriptionally downregulated in PWS mutants, what precludes an independent compensation mechanism from simply turning transcription back up, unless the PWS genes are important for the compensation process itself? It would help to present more about what is known about this compensation mechanism, and whether it occurs transcriptionally or posttranscriptionally. A small decrease in many chaperones does not inherently seem to preclude a possible compensation mechanism. 4.	The paper is rather difficult to read with lots of jargon and a poor narrative flow. The reader has to do a lot of work to figure things out on their own without much help. Several examples of this are provided in the next few comments(#5-8). 5.	Some genes or proteins come up quite suddenly without mentioning their functions or significance. For example, in lines 85-90, SNRPN, SNORD116 and SNORD107 have not been introduced yet as PWS genes, which makes the subsequent conclusion confusing that PWS genes function in beta cells. 6.	In several places in the proteomics and transcriptomics sections, there are long lists of genes or proteins with very little context to orient the reader. It is hard for the reader to make much of these lists, and some guidance as to why they are considered worth pointing out or short take-home messages in these sections would be useful. 7.	The description of engineering PWS INS-1 cells is quite hard to follow. Figure 1B is not very intuitive.  These sections demanded a lot of work from the reader, much of which required looking at supplementary figures to understand the main Results sections. As many readers may not look at these figures, it would help to make this section more accessible. 8.	The rationale for performing RNA-seq of small RNAs is not provided. This section ends up interrupting the main narrative and feeling tangential. 9.	Since PWS cells have altered levels of many proteins, it is unclear whether the total protein content is a good parameter to use for normalization of insulin secretion. 10.	It would help to see the unnormalized raw data for the insulin secretion experiments. Figure 2 shows pooled data from several cell lines. It would also be helpful to see the data for each line separately in a supplementary figure. 11.	It is not stated how many times proteomic and transcriptomic experiments were replicated. It is stated that each was performed on three control and three PWS cell lines, but it is unclear if each line was tested just once. It seems likely that the data depicted in the figures are pooled from the different lines though this is not stated explicitly. More clarity on these points would be useful. Separate figures for unpooled data of each cell line would also be useful in the Supplement so that variability between lines can be seen. 12.	The study emphasizes the deficits in secreted peptides and ER chaperones but doesn’t provide an explanation for proteins that are increased. A number of neuronal active zone proteins are reported to have increased expression at the mRNA level, but for most it is unclear whether this effect extends to the protein level (only CHGB is labeled in Figure 3). The possible relevance of these changes is also unclear. It is pointed out that many of these proteins may play a role in insulin secretion, but it is unclear why potentially increased levels would lead to the decreased secretion observed in PWS cells unless these factors are negative regulators of insulin secretion (though that seems unlikely given their neuronal functions). Thus, the relevance of these results is unclear. 13.	It would be helpful to explicitly state in the Results how many of the genes with reported changes in RNA levels were validated and were not validated by RT-PCR experiments. 14.	It is unclear whether it is standard practice to use an anti-KDEL antibody in Western blots to specifically identify GRP94 and GRP78, given that this antibody would be expected to recognize many proteins. If so, it would be helpful to cite other articles that validate this method or state the same thing. 15.	Electron microscopy images in Fig S17 show one picture of each cell line, leading to the conclusion that PWS cells have normal ultrastructure. It is unclear what criteria were used to make this apparently subjective conclusion (no quantitative data are presented). Also, there is no mention of how many cells and sections were examined. 16.	Fig S18: confocal cell images are difficult to assess. It would be helpful to zoom in on one cell for better comparison. As with EM data, it is unclear what criteria were used to compare the PWS cells to control and no quantitation is provided, nor is there mention of number of cells examined.

This is a way we can help science to go forward. And this is why we decided to publish our manuscript as a preprint, in order to have such a communication with the community (since we are not a N2-fixation group). Please find below a point-by-point answer on your comments. The title is indeed intriguing, however, it describes a really interesting and fascinating new phenomenon, and I am sure that you and several other colleagues wouldn't deal or discuss these findings if the title was not so ""provocative"". I can understand your concerns on something totally new, however, I cannot understand where did you extracted the information that we did not do “multiple re-plating to remove residual nitrogen within the cell”. Please remember that from a single microbial cell for being produced a visible colony on a plate needs hundreds cell cycles. Do you believe that remnants of nitrogen could support this? Regarding your comment “…media and agar with residual nitrogen”. If you carefully read our manuscript, you will understand that we screened >600 endophytic microbial isolates in this experiment. If the media and agar had residual nitrogen we would have also seen growth on a number of unrelated microbes. However, this was not the case in our experiments. Thank you for your suggestion on the pure agar. We did exactly what has been extensively published in the literature, using the protocols described in all these publications. On the other hand, we are a 20 years molecular and diagnostic microbiology Lab and of course we use pure agar (any residues would be a problem for us in any microbial identification). As a confirmation for this please see my comment on the 600 isolates screening in this work. Thank you for your comment on Mo and Fe. If you carefully read our manuscript, you will see that we describe agar plates (Suppl. Fig. 6) and not liquid media. Of course yeasts need Fe and this is the reason why they grow slowly and are stressed as we clearly describe in our manuscript. Your suggestion about the positive control is an excellent suggestion, thanks! Based on the contact with the community we had through this preprint, we now have already started a collaboration with a lab in USA and the Azotobacter vinelandii strain DJ and a ΔnifD mutant are on the way to Crete. Your question about the N2 consumption in a normal atmosphere is something that worried us, too. For this, we were measuring the pressure in every vial at the end of each experiment (no significant changes in pressure were detected), and of course we used the crimper in each assay for all vials. Indeed, the O2 is consumed, however other gas by-products are produced in the vial keeping the pressure stable or with minor changes. We observed the same N2-consumption in O2-rich conditions (respiration), as well as, in O2-free conditions (fermentation), so we did not “measure the change in partial pressure after the consumption of O2 in the vial” as you mention. I would like to mention that Prof. Kotzabasis (co-author) is a ~30 years’ expert on analytical methods like GC-TCD. Your suggestion for 15N gas enrichment is already discussed and agreed with our collaborator in USA (we are not experts on this assay). Regarding the ammonia measurement: If you carefully read our manuscript, you will find information regarding a publication where the authors describe the production of NH4+ when yeasts are grown in Raffinose–NFYM (N2-free yeast medium), Raffinose–NFMM (N2-free mineral medium) and Mannitol–NFMM, so this is already published. For the first draft of our preprint we decided not to repeat these assays, however, we have just received the related kit for repeating them. Regarding your comment “…GC dinitrogen consumption assays…”: This is the surprising point of our discovery! We observed that this biological phenomenon seems to be active in various cultivation conditions (pοοr or rich media; presence or absence of O2, etc.). Of course we have also measured this phenomenon on N2-free liquid media. However, since it also occurs in YPD, I cannot understand why not to use it. Regarding your question on “why would yeast be fixing large amounts of nitrogen when it's freely available?” I have to say I don’t know! However, I would suggest to stop thinking on this phenomenon like we think on the prokaryotic N2-fixation. We don’t know what the mechanism is or if it is less energetic, etc. On the other hand even in prokaryotic N2-fixation organisms, the phenomenon is not so energy consuming as it was initially believed, so it can run in parallel to respiration. But, at the moment we can only speculate... Please google “nitrogen fixation by yeast”, you will be surprised. Like you, we also did not have an idea about the very old observation/claim that some yeast and fungi can grow using atmospheric N2… However, when we initially observed this phenomenon in my lab, we started looking for evidence in the literature and we found some very old literature (e.g. Nitrogen Fixation by Soil Yeasts, Nature, 1954. Nitrogen Fixation by yeasts and other fungi, Nature, 1911, etc.). Apart of these very old reports nobody else has ever investigated the ability of yeast to grow without nitrogen sources this is why no one has seen this in the past. The calibration for the quantification of N2 and O2 volume, has been done by the company provided and maintaining our GC-TCD equipment, by injecting known quantities in the GC-TCD (N2: r2=0,9983; O2: r2=0,9953). As I mentioned before Prof. Kotzabasis (co-author) is a ~30 years’ expert on analytical methods like GC-TCD. The PCR assay has been performed following a treatment with a cocktail of 6 antibiotics and multiple re-cultivations in antibiotic containing media… please be sure that no bacteria could survive this treatment. The protocol for the elimination of bacterial endophytes has been extensively used and has been published in the literature. The 16S primers that we used are common and have been used extensively by a great number of Labs around the globe. When you say “the small amount of growth seen on plates” I am wondering if you have carefully seen the growth in our Fig 1. I will remind you here (as I have mentioned above) that other groups have also observed this phenomenon in the past, however, without proceeding to its analysis.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.12.464130v2#comment-6004434714,biorxivstage,1,"A few concerns have been raised about this manuscript that we wish to address specifically here as well as in a second version of this preprint. Concern 1: We report a large number of eccDNA breakpoints in our samples in this manuscript. This large number and diversity of eccDNAs could be the result of contaminating linear DNA. This contaminating linear could call into question our results. In general, our pipeline could be calling other artefacts as eccDNAs, and has not been as thoroughly vetted as other previously published pipelines. Our response: •	We have performed a thorough degradation of linear DNA in all our samples which follows the standards set by our colleagues in the field. We also verified this degradation using qPCR. •	We provide two PCR experiments that support our claims of little to no linear DNA contamination in our samples. •	We used split reads and discordant reads to identify eccDNA forming regions. Any remaining linear DNA that was directly sequenced would not result in either of these read variants and would therefore not result in calls by our pipeline. We verified this by running our pipeline on whole genome sequencing data from other studies. •	While the phi29 polymerase prefers to amplify circular DNA, contaminating linear DNA may also be amplified, resulting in multimeric sequences that, when sequenced, result in split reads and therefore eccDNA calls by our pipeline. This is an accepted weakness of this protocol in the field. However, this method is still widely used by our colleagues, pointing to the fact that this weakness is not enough to invalidate the analysis of eccDNA sequencing data. Clearly, the preference of the phi29 polymerase for circular DNA is strong enough to allow meaningful analysis. All of the data we re-analyzed in this study used the phi29 amplification protocol and therefore would have been similarly affected by linear DNA contamination, but these samples did not show the abundance of eccDNAs we saw in M. oryzae. •	We sequenced O. sativa samples in addition to our M. oryzae samples to verify that our lab methods were not the source of our observations in M. oryzae. Our sequenced O. sativa samples appeared very similar to the samples produced by a previous study across many characteristics and looked very different from what we saw in M. oryzae. Specifically, the number of eccDNAs identified in those samples were much smaller than in M. oryzae. •	We compared our called eccDNA forming regions to those called using the same sequencing data by a previous study (Møller et al. 2018) and found that our results were largely similar, and our criteria for eccDNA calling was more stringent than those previously published. •	Other previously published pipelines, like ecc_finder, use peaks of sequencing reads in the genome as the primary basis for identifying eccDNAs in the genome. However, given the large diversity of eccDNAs we found in M. oryzae we were unable to rely on a peak calling based approach for our data, and instead wrote our own pipeline that relies entirely on split-mapping reads and opposite facing read pairs which are strong evidence of eccDNAs, and used in conjunction with peak-calling in other pipelines. •	We also compared our Illumina called eccDNAs to eccDNAs called using PacBio data in the same samples. This data is much easier to interpret as long split reads are clear evidence of eccDNA formation. We found substantial overlap between eccDNAs called using our Illumina data and using our PacBio data. Concern 2: We report very little overlap in eccDNA breakpoints between samples, especially among technical replicates, which calls into question the results, especially when it comes to the relevance of genes being found on eccDNAs. This little overlap, combined with potential linear DNA contamination, could point to this study simply over-analyzing noisy data without biological significance. While we explain this lack of overlap by pointing, in part, to under-sequencing, we also claim that this cannot be the reason a subset of genes are never present on eccDNAs in our data which seems contradictory. Our response: •	The number of eccDNA forming regions we identified in each of our technical replicates suggests that each sample contained an extremely large number of distinct eccDNA molecules. Our analysis of split read counts per eccDNA showed that the majority of these eccDNA molecules were very likely present at very low copy numbers. Furthermore, replication of individual eccDNA molecules in M. oryzae is likely to be very rare or non-existent. •	We split our technical replicates after DNA extraction. Given the hugely diverse population of low copy number eccDNAs in each of these samples, it is extremely likely that some eccDNAs ended up in one aliquot and not the others. This likely explains the lack of overlap in exact breakpoints between technical replicates. •	We also showed that increasing our sequencing coverage per technical replicate likely would have led to better overlap between technical replicates. However, this likely would not have completely solved the problem given the low copy number of the eccDNAs. •	Given the little overlap in breakpoints between samples, we instead sought to analyze the hotspots and coldspots for eccDNA formation in the genome. We felt that this analysis was meaningful because, while our technical replicates did not share exact breakpoints, they did share many approximate breakpoints (if we allow boundaries to be within 100 bp of each other, for example) pointing to the existence of these hotspots. We compared this overlap in breakpoints to our expected overlap if we had sequenced random segments of the genome in each sample and found no such overlap. •	We chose to focus on these hotspots and coldspots by taking a gene-based perspective and counting how often M. oryzae genes were fully contained within eccDNAs in our data, regardless of the exact breakpoints of the eccDNAs. This helped us identify a group of genes that we never found fully contained within an eccDNA in any of our samples. In this case, we were able to show, through rarefaction and permutation analyses, that we do not expect that increasing our sequencing coverage would have led to the discovery of all of these genes in our samples. We used this analysis as evidence that, while under sequencing may have affected our ability to detect overlap in exact breakpoints between samples, it did not explain this observation.",2022-10-05T17:10:51,pmjoubert,Pierre Joubert,10.1101/2021.10.12.464130,"The extrachromosomal circular DNAs of the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae contain a wide variety of LTR retrotransposons, genes, and effectors","Pierre M.

Review synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. In this preprint Munhoz et al. identify adiponectin as the main effector of the protective effects of sera from lean women and calorie-restricted rats on beta-cell integrity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The study reports that sera from obese humans and rats impairs beta-cell integrity and insulin secretion in the absence of nutrient overload. This observation implies that changes in circulating factors between obese and lean individuals would explain the effects on beta-cell function. The levels of circulating adiponectin in rat sera and human plasma were consistent with the metabolic effects observed in beta-cells. Finally, adding adiponectin to islet cultures that were incubated with sera from obese individuals restored beta-cell integrity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The data are reported in a clear way and the manuscript is well written. Data are consistent with a role of adiponectin in the observed protective effects, but some additional experiments are suggested to clarify this role. Major comments The paper states that adiponectin is necessary to maintain islet function and integrity. According to the data reported, it is recommended to amend the conclusions to indicate that adiponectin is “sufficient”. A key experiment to demonstrate that adiponectin  is necessary would be to deplete the sera of adiponectin and then evaluate the same parameters on beta-cells/islet primary culture. Adiponectin-receptor KO beta-cells would also help to clarify the role of adiponectin in the protective effects of sera. It may also be worth exploring if there were other hormones or other components beyond adiponectin which may have the similar increase in serum samples. In Figure 3A/3B, a picture of the corresponding Ponceau used for quantification should be shown next to the adiponectin blot. It would also be helpful to provide the full raw blots as supplementary files to allow for further evaluation, e.g. there seems to be a faint band in 3A above the predicted band which might be cropped in 3B, and there seems to be some difference in protein migration in different samples. Please show as a supplementary figure the full blot for adiponectin with all the samples shown in quantification. In the blot in Figure 3B there does not appear to be a clear difference between adiponectin levels in lean vs obese women, which would argue against adiponectin having a beneficial metabolic effect when treating beta-cells. It would be useful to provide some further comments on this possible discrepancy. Figure 4E compares different amounts of glucose with either FBS or no serum+adiponectin. Another condition with only no serum + vehicle for adiponectin should be included as a negative control, as shown in Figure 5. Minor comments Abstract - Please specify in which model (cell/islet culture) the effects are observed. Sex-specific differences - The findings in humans are really interesting. However, only male rats are reported in this manuscript. Would there be any difference between male and female CR-rats sera when applied to beta-cells? This experiment would be a great addition to the paper. If the experiment cannot be completed at this time, there should be a mention to this limitation in the discussion. Results ‘ Fig. 1A shows that the animals on the CR diet gained significantly less weight over the course of 15 weeks, but did not lose mass’ - This text refers to mass, the figure legend says weight, the y axis title on the figure states body mass. Please clarify for consistency. Results  ‘ They were within the same age range (Table 1), but were clearly distinct in body mass indexes (BMI), which separated them into lean and obese groups: lean women (BMI 22 ± 0.9, Fig. 2B) ’ - Please clarify the reference to Figure 2B in this fragment as the figure does not report BMI. Results ‘ these results show a clear modulatory effect of circulating blood factors on metabolic fluxes in β-cells, which are stimulated by factors present in samples from lean and female subjects. ’ - It is interesting that this is only observed for females, does this suggest that there may be sex-related factors involved, instead of or in addition to diet status? Could some further comment be added as to why the effect may only be observed in females. Please mention in the abstract/discussion that the results are obtained from in vitro experiments using beta-cells and islet primary cultures. Conclusions: suggest specifying  “in the blood of lean rats ” in the fragment that states “... in the blood of lean animals ”. Methods Please report the method of euthanasia. ‘experiments were carried out in accordance with the A. C.

My opinion is that this manuscript offers little evidence of these stated results. My biggest concern is the contamination of media and agar with residual nitrogen and the lack of multiple replatings to remove residual nitrogen within the cell. Besides the statement on line 23, the authors do not list how many times the yeast strains were replated on nitrogen-free agar to confirm that residual nitrogen is not being used. Regular agar tends to have some small amount of nitrogen left over from its purification process. We have experienced that nitrogen-fixing bacteria will not derepress nitrogenase unless on pure agar. We use noble agar to make nitrogen-free plates. But for these experiments where absolute proof is required, I suggest using electrophoresis grade agarose as the thickening agent of plates For the media lacking Mo and Fe, was chelating or acid washing of the growth bottles performed to remove Fe and Mo? Does yeast require some Fe for growth? Suppl Fig 6 does not seem the yeast grew very well compared to Fig 1. Therefore it seems that Mo or Fe might be required, or there are residual metals or nitrogen in the media. A positive control in parallel with an acetylene reductase assay is required for the GC-TCD dinitrogen consumption assays. This will show that known biological nitrogen fixation bacteria act similarly to the yeast in your experiment. Azotobacter vinelandii is a model aerobic diazotroph with lots of experimental data to compare to. I am afraid the dinitrogen consumption assay is a very unusual way of determining nitrogen fixation in a normal atmosphere. Most N2 consumption assays are performed in vitro with nitrogenase under an argon atmosphere as one can measure the change in concentration of N2. I am afraid the authors are measuring the change in partial pressure after the consumption of O2 in the vial. 15N gas enrichment or 15N natural abundance assay must be performed to confirm atmospheric dinitrogen assimilation. Ammonia or the total N of the cells is never measured. Therefore, it should be easy to compare the biomass before and after and determine if there is more nitrogen in the bioreactor. Why are the GC dinitrogen consumption assays performed on media with added nitrogen? Where are the assays with nitrogen-free media? Biologically why would yeast be fixing large amounts of nitrogen when it's freely available? S. cerevisiae is one, if not the most, studied organisms in the history of biology. Is there any evidence in the literature that provides any clues that it is fixing nitrogen under ammonia-supplemented conditions? Please provide a standard curve of nitrogen and oxygen for the GC data. How do you calculate the initial N2 concentration in the headspace? Suppl Fig 10. The 16s primers seem to not work well on the positive control of E. coli. If a small population of bacteria was symbiotic with the yeast, this gel does not show they are not there. The authors have failed to produce any convincing evidence that yeast strains can fix atmospheric nitrogen. While careful experimentation and multiple controls might still prove their hypothesis correct, contamination from nitrogen in the media or a diazotrophic bacteria is most likely allowing the small amount of growth seen on plates. In addition, the GC assay does not have proper controls and is inadequate to show nitrogen fixation.",2022-10-03T20:00:55,alexanderalleman,Alexander Alleman,10.1101/2022.09.29.510055,Atmospheric nitrogen fixation by eukaryotes: Should we reconsider the nitrogen cycle in nature?,"Nikolaos Arapitsas, Christos A.

Review synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. The preprint examines the meiotic recombination co-factor MND1 and its role in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in somatic cells. The paper reports that MND1 stimulates DNA repair through homologous recombination (HR) but is not involved in the response to replication-associated DSBs. MND1 localization to DSBs occurs through direct binding to RAD51-coated ssDNA. MND1 loss potentiates the G2 DNA damage checkpoint and the toxicity of IR-induced damage, opening avenues for therapeutic intervention, particularly in HR-proficient tumors. The reviewers raised some minor comments and suggestions on the work: Results ‘ Therefore, we conclude that MND1-HOP2 are ubiquitously expressed proteins’ - we understand that the study looked at the transcript's expression level and not protein levels, consider revising this sentence. Figure 1F - Due to the differences in intensity for the loading control, recommend quantifying the normalized level of MND1. ‘we used live-cell imaging of RPE1 cells’ - Are these cells p53 KO? In Suppl. Figure 1K, RPE Delpta-p53 cells are used , but the HALO tag was introduced in the normal (WT) RPE cells. Could some clarification be provided for this difference, and report what's the level of MND1 and the effects of its loss in WT RPE cells? ‘Analysis of 53BP1 foci formation and resolution in asynchronously growing RPE1 cells revealed that MND1 depletion leads to slower repair and retention of DSBs after IR (Figure 2A, Suppl. Figure 2F&G)’ - While the quantification shown in Figure 2A is explicit, the foci in the raw images displayed in Suppl. Figure 2G appears to be more frequent in the siNT, especially in the last 2 time points. It may be worth making the images bigger and maybe clearer? ‘our data show that the role of MND1 in DNA repair is most prominent in G2 phase cells and restricted to repair of two-ended DSBs’ - Can some further context be provided for the last part of this claim. Is this due to the different modes of action of the different drugs used? If so, it would be nice to clarify in the text which drugs induce the two-ended DSBs. ‘These data show that MND1 is recruited to sites of DSBs’ - The data shows that there is an increase in MND1 foci, but whether these are or not the sites of DSBs is not clear. Recommend co-staining with a known DSBs marker.

Review synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. The preprint studies the molecular function of Arl15, a member of the Arf-like GTPases (Arls) group, which has been linked to magnesium homeostasis. The manuscript reports that Arl15 localizes in the Golgi and plasma membrane, including filopodia. The dissociation of Golgi or the expression of Arf1 dominant-negative mutant leads to a mislocalization of Arl15 to the cytosol. Knocking down Arl15 results in reduced filopodial number, altered focal adhesion kinase organization, and enhanced cargo uptake. Arl15 knockdown decreases cell migration and enhances cell spreading and adhesion strength. The findings point to a functional role for Arl15 in the Golgi. General comments Figures 1,2, 3 - The images display one representative example, recommend providing quantification (e.g. PCC/Manders) across several biological replicates, as well as information on the type of images reported, single slice, max Z projection etc. For the bar plots, the paper reports the number of cells as well as the number of times the experiment was repeated, which is excellent. However, it is unclear whether the SEM error bars and p-values were calculated based on the number of repeats (correct) or based on the number of cells (incorrect). Can clarification be provided for this point. See https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb... and https://doi.org/10.1371/jou.... Throughout the paper there are several references to ‘data not shown’ - please report the data for those items. Specific comments Introduction, first paragraph - Suggest shortening the paragraph, particularly regarding the description of the different Arls and their relationship/correlation with all diseases. ‘These results show that similar to HeLa cells, Arl15-GFP localizes to PM along with filopodia and Golgi in all mammalian cell types’ - Suggest revising the fragment to ‘all the mammalian cell types tested in the study’, to avoid generalizing to every mammalian cell type. ‘the localization of Arl15-GFP to PM however remained unchanged as compared to DMSO treated cells (Fig. 2A). ’ - Fig 2A only compares mCherry-UtrCH against Arl15-GFP. To support this claim, Arl15-GFP would need to be compared to WGA-AF, as in Figure 1, and their colocalization quantified to confirm that it remained unchanged. ‘We treated mCherry-UtrCH expressing HeLa:Arl15-GFP stable cells with a small molecular inhibitor of Rac1 (CAS 1177865-17-6) or Cdc42 (ML141)’ - Please report the concentration of both inhibitors. ‘Overall, these studies indicate that neither actin depolymerization nor the key regulatory molecules of filopodia/lamellipodia affect the localization of Arl15 to PM/Golgi.’ - The visualization reports Arl15-GFP v mCherry-UtrCH, to support the claim please check against WGA/GM130 as in Figure 1. Also, Figure 2c Arl15 for FAK inhibitor looks different from the DMSO control, recommend confirmation with WGA staining. Can also some explanation be provided for the fact that the Arl-15 in Figure 2A and 2C DMSO looks quite different from 2B and 2D despite the stable cell line with uniform expression? ‘which mislocalized Golgi pool of Arl15 without affecting its PM localization (Fig. 2D)’ - There does not seem to be a marked difference in Arl15-GFP's intracelluar localisation in cells with and without microtubules, and the PM signal appears slightly reduced in the Nocodazole-treated cells. Is it possible to please quantify the localisation? Figure 2 -The quality of the images from panels B and D looks very different from those of A and C. Can some clarification be provided, were the same microscope, camera, and settings used? Figure 3 - It would be good to mention the role of brefeldin A as an ATPase inhibitor to provide context for why it is being used. ‘Surprisingly, Arl15-GFP localized to the cytosol as similar to Arf1-GFP in GM130 dispersed cells that are indicative of brefeldin A treatment in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A).’ - It may be worth clarifying the reference to a surprising result, considering the nocadozol results would this result not be expected? It may also be worth providing some comments about the possible PM localisation difference when Golgi is disrupted with nocadozol vs BrefeldinA/golgicide A. It seems that the PM localisation is also affected in the BrefeldinA/golgicideA treatments. Figure 3A ‘ Cells were treated with DMSO (as control), brefeldin A or golgicide A for 24 h followed fixation’ - Please comment on the 24-hour period, BFA would be expected to work in minutes timescale: https://rupress.org/jcb/art... Supplementary Fig 2A - The blots for Arl15 endogenous are very different between S2A and S2B. Also a 40% knockdown of Arf1 decreases the level of Arl15 by 17%. Can some comments be provided on the significance of this decrease. Figure 4 - Is the SEM over 3 independent experiments or total number of cells from the three experiments? What was the criteria used to define a structure as filopodia? ‘However, we continued with Arl15V80A,A86L,E122K cytosolic mutant to study the functionality of Arl15 in HeLa cells ’ - It may be worth specifying the reason to use the V80A,A86L,E122K form instead of the more simple V80A alone? ‘To test whether the mislocalized Cav-2 and STX6 are targeted to lysosomes in siArl15 cells’ - Please comment on why colocalisation with lysotracker or lamp1 positive structures was not examined  instead of treating the cells with bafilomycin A1? Note that bafilomycin A1 also inhibits retrograde membrane traffic at the ER–Golgi boundary: https://www.molbiolcell.org... Figure 5 -  Please clarify whether the quantification of images was done on images taken from the same microscope? Also, suggest arranging the figures in a way that the quantification and images are not so far apart from each other. Figure 5D - It is unclear how the western blot of EGFR showing total EGFR is indicative of what happened to its trafficking, this appears to be in contrast to the increase in transferrin uptake data. Recommend normalizing the transferrin uptake to surface transferrin levels as one can have higher uptake simply because there is more transferrin receptor instead of actual changes in trafficking rates. ‘Nevertheless, the reason for the partial loss of STX6 and caveolin-2 localization from Golgi in the ASAP1/2 knockdown cells requires investigation’ - Text earlier mentioned ""However, we have not observed any significant change in Arl15 and its dependent cargo (caveolin-2 and STX6) localization to Golgi in siASAP1/2 cells "" and there does not appear to be any difference in the siASAP1 or siASAP2 on Fig 6.

This manuscript examines how the two transactivation domains (TADs) of β-catenin interact with several domains of CBP/p300 to potentially control transcriptional activation. A combination of biochemistry, NMR, and ITC studies narrow down several binding sites for TAZ1 and TAZ2 domains. Overall, the manuscript is well organized and provides new details on these interactions that may play a role in β-catenin function. We have some suggestions that might enhance the clarity of the work below. Thanks for an enjoyable read! Figure 1: •	The schematics do not depict consistent widths/domain lengths and CBP/p300 is missing some domains, including one implicated in β-catenin binding (Emami et al. 2004, PNAS). •	It would be helpful if your schematic also illustrated all of the constructs used in the study and these names were used consistently. •	If space allows, a simplified diagram of the pathway described in the text could be helpful. Figure 2: •	It would be helpful to add dashed line for predicted secondary structure cut-off at 0.3 in panel B. •	It would enhance the rigor of the work to show expression levels for the constructs used in panel C. Figure 3: •	Labeling the MW markers, light and heavy IgG chains, and proteins (does the 666-781 fragment overlap with the light chain?) in panel A, along with the input, would make this figure easier to read. •	The results of the pulldown seem pretty straightforward so quantification from n = 2 experiments seems unnecessary. If you do so, please define what ‘relative’ means in the quantification and make sure that your statistical methodologies are appropriate for this low n. Figure 4: •	There is some concern that the ITC data might be overfit to a two-site binding model without more information on the fits.  Additional rationale or evidence that justifies use of the two-site model would also be welcome. Figures 5 & 7: •	It might be easier to interpret the binding interface if you used surface representation for the TAZ domains instead of ribbon. Figure 8: •	It was a bit confusing to show an analysis of the NMR data from the construct used in Fig. S3 in panel A,  but then use data in panels B – E from a larger construct. We struggled a bit throughout the manuscript to match domain names and fragments (see Fig. 1 comment above) with the data. •	It could be helpful to conclude with a cartoon or schematic that illustrates what was learned here. Other: •	Discussion text mentions a possible role for phosphorylation of serines; if citations for this exist, please add them or perhaps broaden this to a possible role for PTMs in general. •	Consistent labeling of ITC data throughout the paper would help clarify which fragments of b-catenin were used in each experiment.",2022-10-02T17:56:40,carriepartch,Carrie Partch,10.1101/2022.08.30.505852,β-catenin interacts with the TAZ1 and TAZ2 domains of CBP/p300 to activate gene transcription,"Alexandra D.

The demonstration that EB3 cannot substitute for EB1 in maintaining microtubule growth perhaps should not come as a great surprise since EB3 occupies a more proximal position than EB1 at the microtubule plus end as first shown in cell lines (Dart et al; 2017, Oncogene 36, 4111-4123 https://doi.org/10.1038/onc...

How might this impact the results? Of course, it can hard to half the concentration of the bacteria in the setup to create the Bliss model (although maybe something with lower glucose might help?) Might the fastest grower in each pair/trio reach the highest concentration, limit the growth of other species, and therefore provide an effect quite similar to itself in isolation? How would a ""fastest grower"" model compare to a ""strongest"" model?
