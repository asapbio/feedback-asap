Using variable concentrations of nocodazole to stabilise (low) or destabilise (high) MTs allows precise temporal control of spindle density/dynamics. However, it's a global change to the MTs and it's not clear what relative effect the Noc has on interpolar, kinetochore, centrosomal and augmin-mediated MTs. It would be interesting to know if these distinct populations are affected differentially and therefore what can be said about the relative contributions to spindle-chromosome rheology. In our previous work in Drosophila embryos (Hayward et la., Dev Cell 2014), we used an anti-Dgt6 antibody to specifically inactivate Augmin upon entry into mitosis (Augmin recruits the MT nucleator, g-TuRC to pre-existing spindle MTs increasing the overall density of the spindle ~2-fold). Augmin inhibition results in the dramatic loss of short spindle MTs, a reduction in spindle density and increase in pole-to-pole distance. Something we noted was that chromosome movement (as well as congression) was affected. Additionally, using a Rod-GFP fly line in the presence of Augmin inhibition, we saw all sorts of abnormal Rod-GFP movements along the kinetochore MTs that remained, suggesting something wrong with the forces between the kMT and the kinetochores. I think we talked a bit about this in the discussion - suggesting the abnormal congression was due to the rheology of the overall spindle being compromised by loss of the Augmin-generated (non-kinetochore) mass of short MTs.",2026-01-21T09:19:45,wakefieldjames,"Wakefield, James",10.64898/2026.01.17.700110,Coordinated chromosome motion emerges from mechanical coupling mediated by the physical spindle environment,"Jiali Zhu, Kerry Bloom, Ehssan Nazockdast, Paul Maddox",2026-01-20

Here are our highlights: Authors propose a ""theory-to-practice"" bridge for phylogeny: take a mathematically defined ""forest"" algorithm (that most biologists have never used) and then test it under simulation settings chosen to look biologically reasonable (Jukes-Cantor, short branches). The work deliberately departs from the standard paradigm of ""always returning a fully resolved tree"". The algorithm is optimized to avoid false splits and is allowed to output partial structures or abstain entirely. This places the method firmly in a precision-first regime rather than traditional phylogenetic benchmarking. The main onservation: the value of forest methods lies in explicitly identifying which parts of the data are informative and in providing downstream analyses with a more faithful representation of uncertainty. While the current approach outperforms NJ only in narrow regimes, the conceptual shift toward partial, conservative outputs (especially hybrid workflows that combine forests with standard tree-building methods) appears promising. The paper data are generated under a simple but biologically valid model, and the authors release the complete pipeline for data generation and experimentation.

PET is widely used in packaging and textiles and persists in the environment as macro- and microplastics, posing environmental and health concerns. While PET-degrading enzymes have been studied extensively in vitro, practical whole-cell microbial solutions for environmental PET degradation have remained limited. The authors isolated a strain of Pseudomonas umsongensis that can metabolize terephthalate, a key monomer released from PET hydrolysis. To enable direct PET degradation, the strain was genetically engineered to secrete the high-activity PET hydrolase PHL7 using a recombinant twin-arginine translocation (TAT) secretion signal. This allowed extracellular degradation of PET into assimilable products. Additionally, PET was pre-treated with an organic solvent to create an amorphous and macroporous structure, significantly improving enzyme accessibility and bioavailability. The study demonstrates that the engineered bacterium can grow using PET-derived carbon, providing evidence of true microbial consumption rather than simple enzymatic breakdown. This represents an important advancement toward sustainable plastic upcycling and bioremediation approaches that could operate outside controlled laboratory conditions. However, the work remains a preprint and has not yet undergone peer review, so conclusions should be considered preliminary.

With these longer experiments where the mice are exposed to a multitude of agents (tumor cells, CAR-T cells, and more tumor cells), were the DIO mice still significantly more obese than the low-fat diet mice throughout the roughly 20 weeks? It should also be reported whether or not the mice were kept on their high-fat or low-fat diet throughout these experiments. It would be helpful to report endpoint tumor mass or tumor volume after rechallenge.

It would suggest that there is not an inherent deficiency in CAR-T cell function, at least initially, based on diet despite the earlier finding in Figure 4 that the different CAR-T cells exhibit differences in exhaustion. In Figure 6B, it would be more informative to include nontransduced control on same graph or at least match the axis values to figure 6D. Why was the study in figure 4D stopped at 15 days when it is shown in figure 6B that tumor growth continues despite injections even in healthy mice? I’m not sure it can ultimately be concluded that these results indicate changes in the TME. I think that more analysis would need to be done as all these figures indicate is that DIO mice appear worse at controlling tumor volume. Additionally, it doesn’t say anything about T cell function either as regardless of T cell donor, the tumors are shown to have reduced volume. I think that this is an overstatement of what the results are showing.",2026-01-19T17:44:47,jncbge,Jncbge,10.1101/2025.10.10.681694,Obesity Impairs the Antitumor Activity of CAR-T Cells in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Hannah M.

This would suggest that you don’t even need CAR-T cells to reduce tumor burden in obese patients. What are your thoughts on this? In Figure 2E-L, The graphs should be combined to show all 4 experimental groups on one graph (scramble E0771 administered to control mice, shB7H3 E0771 administered to control mice, scramble E0771 administered to DIO mice, and shB7H3 E0771 administered to DIO mice) and statistical analysis should be performed across all 4 groups (with an ANOVA).  As an example, 2E should be combined with 2I. In figure 2M, comparing these 2 groups is not informative in terms of assessing the transcriptomic changes that occur when B7-H3 suppressed tumor cells are administered to lean vs obese mice.  The comparison between control mice that received tumor cells that were not B7-H3 suppressed vs DIO mice that received B7-H3 suppressed tumor cells is not entirely useful unless the other two groups are presented. The data presented do not adequately support the claim that suppressing B7-H3 in obesity helps restore immune function, especially without seeing the transcriptomic changes that occur in control mice given B7-H3 suppressed tumor cells. Additionally, from a graphic design perspective it is difficult to interpret this figure without some way to indicate differences in circle size aside from just hoping the reader will observe it.",2026-01-19T17:44:22,jncbge,Jncbge,10.1101/2025.10.10.681694,Obesity Impairs the Antitumor Activity of CAR-T Cells in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Hannah M.

It may be helpful for readers to outline the choice of cytokines here more. In the supplemental figures for figure 1, you observe no significant difference in B7-H3 relative expression when using TNF and IFNy for either human cancer cell line.

Some of the graduate students thought it might be a good exercise to practice writing feedback and questions about your paper. Please find below some of the comments we came up with. Overall thoughts The title seems to overstate what is actually found in the paper. In a mouse model, you observed that CAR-T cells specific for B7-H3 were found to reduce tumor volume in a murine E0771 model. Furthermore, the analysis you did in figure 4 revealed that there appeared to be differences in exhaustion phenotype and glycolytic activity, but not in cytolytic killing or cytokine secretion. In figure 6, it is further shown that non transduced DIO mice display a tumor volume on average of 600 mm3 by 15 days, whereas when DIO mice are given CAR-T cells from a DIO donor, the average tumor volume is around 325 mm3 by 25 days. This would suggest that the CAR-T cells are still working in the obese mice. Perhaps something else is contributing to the change in volume. Regarding DIO mice, have they developed poor glycemic control at the time of the experiments?  Further, would performing experiments when the mice have been on high-fat diets for different lengths of time (eg. 15 weeks of HFD vs 18 weeks of HFD vs 25 weeks of HFD) affect glycemic control?  Without performing a glucose tolerance test, for example, it is not possible to rule out glycemic control as a possible confounding variable and attribute the phenotypes noted to obesity alone. The timepoints should be consistent across experiments of the same type.  As an example, in Figure 2, body mass is reported from day 0 - day 18, but tumor volume is reported from day 0 - day 21.  Although it is unlikely that any significant change in body mass occurred in days 18 - 21, there is no way to know without reporting it. This is more relevant when looking at figure 6B and 6D.  In figure 6B, the last timepoint was after 20 days, whereas in figure 6D, 15 days was the latest timepoint.",2026-01-19T17:43:14,jncbge,Jncbge,10.1101/2025.10.10.681694,Obesity Impairs the Antitumor Activity of CAR-T Cells in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Hannah M.

Technical Note regarding the history and capability of flow cytometric sorting of plant protoplasts. We read with interest the description of the PIVOT platform and its application to high-throughput functional genetics in Nicotiana benthamiana. The use of viral superinfection exclusion to ensure single multiplicity of infection (MOI) per cell is an elegant and clever approach to pooled library delivery. However, we would like to offer a technical correction regarding the stated incompatibility of Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) with N. benthamiana protoplasts. The manuscript suggests that current FACS instruments are not compatible with fragile protoplasts sizing 20-100 µm in diameter. On the contrary, the plant flow cytometry community has successfully utilized large-bore, low-pressure flow sorting for these exact cell types for over forty years. Historically, specialized configurations—including the use of large flow tips (up to 200 µm) and reduced sheath pressure—have allowed for the high-purity sorting of intact, viable protoplasts ranging from 40 to nearly 100 µm. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that Nicotiana protoplasts sorted via FACS remain totipotent and can be regenerated into fertile, whole plants, demonstrating that the shear forces of a correctly configured sorter are not inherently lethal to these wall-less cells. While Magnetic-Activated Protoplast Sorting (MAPS) provides a valuable biochemical alternative for labs without access to specialized large-particle sorters, we believe the manuscript would benefit from a more accurate characterization of flow cytometry's historical and current capabilities in plant biology.

The demonstration that lipid exchange precedes or accompanies substrate transfer in both Dot/Icm (Legionella pneumophila) and RK2 (Escherichia coli) systems is particularly elegant and mechanistically informative. However, the concept that host contact itself acts as the primary trigger for secretion system activation is not unprecedented and was demonstrated more than 25 years ago for Type III secretion systems (T3SSs). In a seminal study, Brito et al. (1999) showed that expression of hrp genes in the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum is specifically induced upon direct bacterium–plant cell contact, independently of secretion activity itself. This contact-dependent induction requires the outer membrane protein PrhA, which functions as a bacterial receptor sensing a non-diffusible signal from the plant cell wall, thereby activating virulence gene transcription (EMBO Journal, 1999). Together, these studies suggest that contact-dependent sensing of host surfaces is a conserved and ancient principle governing the activation of bacterial secretion systems, albeit implemented through distinct molecular mechanisms (transcriptional induction in T3SSs versus lipid-mediated priming in T4SSs). Explicitly acknowledging this conceptual continuity would strengthen the broader biological context of the present work and highlight how it extends a long-standing paradigm from transcriptional regulation to biophysical membrane-level priming.

This is clearly indicative of over-fitting and inaccurate application of cross-validation. Regardless of the actual correlation of gut microbiome composition with disease, it is scientifically implausible that it could accurately predict ""heart failure"" and ""schizophrenia"" with >99% accuracy as depicted here. It is also worth noting that in Figure 3C on ""external validation"" the model does not particularly outperform a simple random forest on any of the examples. The abstract states ""Furthermore, its attention patterns reveal biologically plausible microbial signatures"", but this is clearly not correct from a cursory reading of Figure 4. The top feature in predicting ""Healthy vs Disease"" is V. cholerae, but that is simply because one of the studies included in this analysis was on patients selected because they were known to be infected with V. cholerae. This is a particularly good example of why simply predicting ""healthy vs disease"" across unrelated and disparate studies is not a particularly scientifically meaningful exercise. Further, the other top features across studies are Staphylococcus epidermis, a skin microbe that only residues transiently in the gut microbiome. This is a decent indicator of contamination, and it is therefore likely that this feature is  because the model is overfitting on signals of contamination endemic to particular studies. Staphylococcus is unlikely to be involved in a causal role in any of these diseases.

The integration of GRN priors with Mamba blocks presents a promising approach. However, we are unable to reproduce the fine-tuning process or utilize RegFormer as a foundation model due to two critical missing components in the provided GitHub repository: 1. The Vocabulary File: The code calls for default_gene_vocab.json, which is essential for aligning gene token IDs with the pretrained model. Generating a new vocabulary from HGNC (as suggested by the helper functions) creates a mismatch with the pretrained embedding dimensions. 2. Pretrained Model Checkpoints: While the paper mentions pretraining on 26 million cells, the pretrained weights (checkpoint files) are not available in the repository or linked in the ""Data Availability"" section. Several users have raised similar concerns in the GitHub Issues section without a response. Could you please provide a link (e.g., via Stomics Cloud or Zenodo) to these essential files? While the manuscript claims RegFormer, as a foundation model, is distributed as an open-source repository, the omission of critical checkpoints renders this claim invalid in practice.

However, I think the claim already implicit  in the title suggesting that the mice GABAergic cells surrounding the Pbg represents Imc neurons of birds is unfounded. To begin with, Imc neurons are strongly motion selective, as are the entire  isthmic circuit and tectofugal system of birds, and do not respond to static gratings. In fact, a missing aspect of this very complete study is to record from the PLTI's neurons and see if they have some selectivity to the orientation of the gratings used  in the behavioral paradigm. In this respect, why using gratings in the behavioral tests and looming stimulation in the electrophysiological recording experiments in in intermediate layers of the SC?. The avian isthmotectal system, composed by the Ipc, Imc and SLu nuclei,  is an incredible mechanism that seems to mediate stimulus competition, perhaps spatial attention, and it is very tempting to look for a similar system in mammals. However, there are substantial anatomical and physiological differences between the Ipc and Pbg to assume that they are homolog or play a similar function, and the same applies for the Imc and the PLTi. It seems this study found an important component of a neural mechanism mediating stimulus competition in mice, but my guess is that it is entirely different to the avian one.",2026-01-08T20:18:20,,Gonzalo Marin,10.1101/2022.06.27.497794,Ancient brainstem inhibitory neurons control selective spatial attention,"Ninad B.

One related piece of work seems missing from the discussion/citations: Ibrahim et al. (2023). That paper uses AF2-multimer specifically to identify functional short linear motifs (AIM/LIR) that mediate ATG8/LC3 interactions, including noncanonical motifs and pathogen/virus-encoded virulence factors targeting host autophagy, and it combines modeling with phylogenetic analysis and binding/functional assays. Given the conclusion that linear-motif mimicry is frequent, a discussion of Ibrahim et al. would help place the findings in the context of prior AF2-multimer-enabled SLiM discovery—while also clarifying what’s novel here (scale across thousands of host–pathogen PPIs and comparative interface/mimicry analysis versus a focused, mechanism-driven motif family).
