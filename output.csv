I think this is very important for future research regarding T. cruzi and it's genome's contribution to Chagas disease. Sequencing this strain, whose whole genome has never been sequenced, is a significant contribution. Despite some limitations, this was done successfully and I think it will push others to work on sequencing genomes from other strains, particular those from field samples. I think this is a great step for further research in looking at the relation between transposable elements and multigene families. The methodology in this study was very convincing. I especially like the extra steps done to address the limitations of the Busco Score. I think comparing ORF length of assemblies from other strain with similar characteristics really helped improve your methodology. The paper had a logical flow, but I do believe limitations should have been further explained in the discussion. I think this would have really improved this paper. Overall, this was great work that opens up to more questions regarding this field which I hope this team or other researchers would look at in the future. Not only was a whole genome of this strain sequenced, but it was done using ONT nanopore sequence alone which can provide a less expensive method for sequencing T.cruzi genomes.  A few questions that came to mind was how different do you think your results would have been if you used ONT nanopore sequencing with supplementation of other technologies. Also how different would your results have been if you used a field isolated samples instead of a lab strain? Do you think you would have found a greater correlation between transposable elements and multigene families?",2023-10-25T00:53:17,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2023.07.27.550875,Whole Genome Assembly of a Hybrid Trypanosoma cruzi Strain Assembled with Nanopore Sequencing Alone,"Jill M.C.

Congratulations on the work. I notice that some discussions on dynamo are not accurate --unfortunately it has happened repetitively in the literature such as stating dynamo requires data with metabolic labeling only and the vector field gives only lear relation between a regulator and its target gene. Related to what discussed here,  with the dynamo vector field one can predict cell states NOT covered by the data. That is, dynamo is a generative model. So the criticism on using embedding is not justified. One uses low-dimensional manifold embedding (e.g. in Dynamo) to simplify the model (with reduced number of parameters to specify), and it is well-established that a dynamical system typically falls to a low-dimensional manifold after a transient period of time. A famous example is the 3-variable Lorenz  model. Starting from any initial state, it falls to a strange attractor with dimensionality 2.06",2023-10-24T17:32:53,jianhua_xing,Jianhua Xing,10.1101/2022.08.04.502825,Transcriptomic forecasting with neural ODEs,"Rossin Erbe, Genevieve Stein-O’Brien, Elana J.

It is really exciting to see that receiving both vaccines concurrently enhances the protectiveness of the COVID-19 booster. I have two questions: 1. Why is it that the group that received the two vaccines on different days were not administered the flu vaccine on the same number of days apart after the COVID vaccine? In the study it was stated that the flu shot just needed to be administered any time within 4 weeks from the time of the COVID booster. Could this have made the results more difficult to interpret? If you were to redo the study, do you think that the data would be more reliable if the second group all had the later flu shot administer on the same day, or does that not seem to matter? 2. Why was the Ebola vaccine used as the control vaccine in this case? Thank you!

It is great to see novel sequencing methods like Oxford Nanopore sequencing being validated more and more, and by employing a Nanopore-only approach, you have probably helped to assuage some of the anxieties of others in the field regarding this technique. I had a few questions and recommendations regarding this technique. Have you sequenced T. cruzi, or the Tulahuen strain specifically, with short-read sequencing? Are there any hurdles involved with that? Also, do you think that by assembling this genome using the help of short-read sequencing, you would have gotten a better result? Additionally, I think that it would be helpful to show in a figure which coding regions are not impacted by transposable elements, as that would increase the significance of your work.

As the authors have acknowledged, we have never seen evidence in any of our studies of sexual dimorphism in adult presentation with disease or on cardiovascular imaging, either by echocardiography or cardiac MRI. We have seen young men and women suffer cardiovascular complications at similar age of onset in their 20s and 30s. 2. Changes in left atrial area, isovolumic relaxation time and ejection fraction without similar changes in myocardial performance index or global longitudinal strain worry me, as in humans I would expect both to be early indicators of restrictive cardiomyopathy. All of these values are affected by both acute changes in blood pressure (and especially during anaesthesia) and by the longer-term effects of hypertension, so this is an important confounder but again acknowledged. 3. One feature that is expected in human studies of restrictive cardiomyopathy would be corroborative evidence of pulmonary hypertension, occurring as a result of elevated LV end-diastolic pressure, high LA pressure and thereby pulmonary venous hypertension. Was there any TR in the mice model and any measure of TR maximal velocity? 4. I am an adult cardiovascular imaging specialist who practices both echo and CMR. I am only too aware of the variability of echo measures of cardiac function on an intra- and inter-observer basis. At heart rates of 350-450 BPM, I remain very concerned by the reproducibility in small numbers of animals - although I recognise these numbers are considered adequate in the animal physiology world. When I look at the box plots, there is often a wide spread of results, and no idea is given in the manuscript of the intra-observer measurement for example of ejection fraction - I understand that the person was measuring blind and was a single experienced sonographer...but in our practice, we recognise that in experienced hands, EF may vary in humans at up to 10% between scans at heart rates of 70BPM.",2023-10-23T08:13:46,,Richard Steeds,10.1101/2023.10.16.562570,Female Alms1-deficient mice develop echocardiographic features of adult but not infantile Alström Syndrome cardiomyopathy,"Eleanor J.

As I was reviewing your work, some aspects caught my attention which might further enhance its clarity and comprehensiveness. I understand that the study participants in MassCPR might have enrolled voluntarily. If this is the case, there could be potential selection bias to consider. It might be beneficial for readers to see a demographic table that provides baseline characteristics for both groups. Additionally, it would be helpful to understand the factors that influenced participants to either receive both vaccines simultaneously or at two separate intervals. Clarifying this could help readers discern if there might be any inherent differences between these two groups. It also would be enlightening if you could expand on the potential mechanisms of the specific immune interactions that may be driving the increased IgG1 with concurrent vaccination?

I would like to express my sincere appreciation for your paper. Your research on the immunogenicity of these vaccines, especially in the context of concurrent versus separate administration, is of significant importance in the current landscape of emerging COVID-19 strains.

Given that the influenza vaccine undergoes changes each year to adapt to evolving strains, I am curious about the potential impact of these changes on the observed results. Do you believe that the higher and more durable SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses associated with concurrent administration would remain consistent across different influenza seasons? 2. It appears that your study design involves a comparison between concurrent and separate administration, and the results are promising. Could you kindly provide more information on the research methodology? Specifically, was your study a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and if so, was blinding or randomization implemented?

While the sentence you quoted from reference 14 does say that HDACs are generally associated with inactive genes, it's important to read it in context. Just two sentences later, the authors reveal their observation: ""Our data provide evidence that HATs and HDACs are both targeted to transcribed regions of active genes by phosphorylated RNA Pol II."" The presence of HDACs is a dynamic process. In active regions, HDACs and HATs often coexist in a dynamic equilibrium, influencing the acetylation status of histones. So while the action of histone deacetylation usually leads to gene repression, the presence/localization of HDAC itself is not necessarily an indicator of inactive genes. The last statement in the abstract of reference 14 also supports this: ""Silent genes without any H3K4 methylation signal show no evidence of being bound by HDACs."" In our study, we also observed a similar trend, where active marks correlate well with HDAC1/2/3 presence, further supporting this view. Does this answer your question?

The authors employed an interesting approach with restrictions on species dispersal in the models and the results contribute to predicting the effects of climate change in this biome. We see the importance of focusing on biotic changes and % of range loss, but it is our belief that adding the final predictions for each species in the supplementary material, in terms of maps and range shifts (direction of shift), it would be worth and informative because this information is important for managers and decision makers (those who manage conservation units but also to the researchers working on specific taxa). We also think that including a more detailed discussion about some species that have been modelled in other previous studies could enrich the work and make some of the results obtained here clearer. For example, why species with a wide distribution such as Callicebus barbarabrownae would lose their entire area of suitability in 2060? Other studies, such as Barreto et al. 2021 and Gouveia et al. 2016 found different results, could you attribute this to the methodological choices? We think the words used in the bibliographic review were not wide enough to include studies with mammals in the Caatinga because some important references are out of the included papers. The chosen words are mainly related to the biome or region. Maybe another approach would be to review occurrence records in a systematic way looking for articles with species names (as keyword) based on a preliminary list of mammals. Including latitude and longitude in the maps it would be more informative and including political division of states could help to subside discussion for specific regions of Caatinga. We wrote this comment during a meeting to discuss preprint papers that occurred by September, but I was able to post it just now. I saw that the paper was accepted yesterday, so I am not sure if our suggestions/questions will have some worth to the authors (feel free to reply or not), but we decided to contribute with them anyway. Many congratulations for your article! Although we think that some points could be different, we are sure that article is a nice contribution to understand potential effects of climate change in Caatinga :) Comment written at the Laboratório de Ecologia Vegetal, Evolução e Síntese (LEVES) at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, RN, Brasil.

We have addressed the latter issue by uploading our data download script, keggpuller.py, to the project Github.  This code was used to download molecule records from the KEGG database and store them in a commma-separated value format.  This resulted in 6669 records.  The dataset was then further processed to a simpler form to reduce each record to a SMILES string followed by a comma-separated list of letters indicating pathway class membership (this is smiles_property.txt).  We refer to this as the multi-class dataset.  We also considered the problem of classification of a compound as either being a member of a single, given pathway class or not.  We refer to the resulting dataset as the single-class dataset. The authors are correct that the resulting datasets contain duplicate entries.  The single-class dataset contains six duplicates out of 4545, while the multi-class dataset contains 1740 out of 6669. We have re-run our experiments on the datasets with duplicates removed.  The results for single-class classification did not change.  The table of results for multi-class classification can be found at this location. We note that the accuracies of most methods dropped, including ours.  The accuracy statistics for ensemble logistic regression increased. However, we also note that the central results of our paper remain intact -- the relative ordering of accuracy of different machine learning methods (other than ensemble logistic regression) on the data remains the same, and the superiority of our method over the others that we evaluated remains.  Indeed, this is expected because we ran all methods on the same datasets, using the same training/test split methodology. We have uploaded the de-duplicated datasets to the Github page.  The authors are correct to encourage the use of the de-duplicated datasets.  We will also post a correction to our paper.",2023-10-17T00:19:42,abrammagner,Abram Magner,10.1101/2023.10.03.560711,A cautionary tale about properly vetting datasets used in supervised learning predicting metabolic pathway involvement,"Erik D.

Even if the code was there it would be difficult to reproduce – stata is not very widely used. Does the analysis decisively link badger culling to decline in bovine TB in cattle? Culling is confounded with complex changes to gamma and other testing and other measures. There are places in the ms where a claim is made for a link ‘The effect of badger culling…’ but then later:  ‘However, this data analysis cannot explicitly distinguish…….’ APHA have stated more than once that the breakdown data alone are insufficient to show an effect of culling. However, the DID approach is inappropriate because the 52 cull and pre-cull study areas are surrounded by and in close contact with each other and so are not adequately discrete in space and time, breaking a DID requirement. Notably in the four-year period 2016/17 -2019/20 pre-cull and cull areas closely juxta position. Pre-cull and cull interventions may influence change in adjacent pre-cull and cull areas in an irregular and unpredictable manner, via the constant movement of cattle with different intervention histories. Some of the very important bTB testing controls used and the timing of their introduction are not correctly described and some not even mentioned. The approach mixes data from 46 High Risk Area study areas with 6 from the Edge Area. These have very different epidemiological and disease control history profiles and the reason for mixing them is not explained. Pre-cull gamma testing was intense in the Edge Area. While the manuscript mentions additional gamma testing from 2017, gamma testing was erratic between areas and over time. There were considerable numbers of gamma reactors in many of the cull areas in cull years 1 and 2 with similar disclosures to years 3 and 4 but pre-cull use in the HRA was generally low. In both HRA and Edge areas OTFW incidence was declining when many of the additional disease control rules were intensified, and badger culling introduced. The government chief scientist view was that distinguishing and determining with any precision any contribution of badger culling to disease control is not possible, is therefore maintained. It is impossible to distinguish between the effects of badger culling and disease control measures using the DID approach in any meaningful way. The comment made on being unable to match cull and control is unevidenced and a 2022 published and peer reviewed study of this has not been cited, nor alternative approaches such as matching a series of individual farms in cull and control which would have been simpler and easier to monitor on a quarterly basis since 2018, as was the expectation of a High Court ruling. The suggestion that incidence is the better indicator of true burden goes against APHA’s own epidemiology and the greatly clarified understanding of SICCT test sensitivity and specificity. The specificity change resulting from SICCT severe interpretation can be estimated and applied to OTFS, providing, with OTFW, a safe index of known infection. Gamma testing has shown numbers of unidentified reactors in both identified bTB infected and unidentified herds, and this ‘hidden’ reservoir remains undocumented although its size can be deduced. OTFW relates by its nature to older infections with lesions, yet it is newer infections (OTFS) that indicate disease control success (elimination) more accurately, over time. There is no reason to believe that OTFS+OTFW (as above) is not the superior approach and that OTFW is half of the full picture. During the RBCT, prevalence was growing considerably and OTFS rising so the analogy made in this manuscript is inappropriate and trying unconvincingly to defend the historic reference source. By reducing the pre-cull analysis to one data point the significant pre-cull decline is hidden and this also masks true trends. Because the methods are inappropriate, the results are flawed and the conclusions are flawed. There is no way to distinguish between different interventions and change in herd breakdowns since 2013 with the approach taken. There is also need to see clarification of the analysis that is presented in the Appendix – this does not seem to  be the output from the constrained DID analysis, but something else not fully described in methods which  ‘matches’ it  – which stata  process was used ? It is the first analysis referred to in the main text. As well as showing that the BCP effect accounts for less than 2% of breakdowns it doesn’t look quite right that the BCP effect is based on error dof – pseudoreplication?",2023-10-10T13:37:06,disqus_mgwPkHbXfP,Tom Langton,10.1101/2023.09.04.556191,Difference in Differences analysis evaluates the effects of the Badger Control Policy on Bovine Tuberculosis in England,"Colin P.D.

This pattern, however, have been already stated in a recent study (Veron et al. 2019). In this sense, the discussion about the processes involved in the origin of such floras could be improved by the ideas presented by Vasconcelos et al. (2021). In this study, the authors propose that the terms neoendemism and paleoendemism should be replaced by assessment in relation to the actual biogeographic and macroevolutionary processes that had occurred. Moreover, although the authors provide a methodological discussion regarding the scale of the areas analyzed, a stronger emphasis should be put on it. Several large continental areas, for instance, represent large vegetation domains (i.e., Mata Atlântica and Cerrado), which include high number of endemism however unevenly scattered in island-like habitats throughout these areas. 1.

As an example of correlation, in discussion (line 437), the authors report that the higher taxonomic, functional, and spectral diversity found at middle elevations has already been tested all over the world. Could the focus of the hypotheses be stated as the process(es) behind these patterns instead of the correlations per se? 2. The species Phacelia secunda was selected to analyze intraspecific trends between traits and environment, based on the fact that it is present across the elevation gradient (line 224).

I will refer to the energy-minimized structures as ""relaxed"" and otherwise ""unrelaxed"". In this work I only analyzed the relaxed structures. There were so many different things to check that I never got round to checking the effect of energy minimization originally, but I did make sure to save all of the unrelaxed structures. So I re-ran some of the analyses (originally done on the relaxed structures) with the unrelaxed structures. (1: Structure correlations) When comparing AF-PDB correlations for pairs of structures where sequences differ by 1-3 mutations, relaxed and unrelaxed structures give almost identical results. For the case of no mutations, the correlations are actually higher for unrelaxed structures (r=0.38) compared to relaxed structures (r=0.33). This would reduce the residual correlations in Figure 1H by about 0.05. For reference, in Figure 1H the residual AF-PDB correlations range from about 0.15 to 0.35. (2: Blue fluorescence correlation) I checked the strongest AF-phenotype correlation, from Figure 2C. For unrelaxed I get r = -0.92, for relaxed I get r = -0.93. It seems that the energy minimization does help, but it is certainly a minor part of the overall prediction. Bear in mind that this analysis is nowhere near as extensive as what went into the paper, so I might have missed something. The paper has now been accepted, so I don't think it is possible to add this in a new version. Thanks again for asking this important question. I'm personally glad to know the answer (even if it is a bit preliminary).",2023-10-05T06:23:48,disqus_kHaiH8cKyG,John McBride,10.1101/2022.04.14.488301,AlphaFold2 can predict single-mutation effects,"John M.

LIVe hosts an activity called the ""Preprint Club,"" where we select preprints for reading and critical review. I have chosen your preprint: ""The Penetration of Sunflower Root Tissues by the Parasitic Plant Orobanche cumana Wallr. is Intracellular."" This is an interesting, well-written, and well-illustrated paper describing a robust and scientifically sound study. The study demonstrates that intrusive cells invade living host cells intracellularly, leading to the degradation of the cell wall. These results can contribute to the selection of candidate genes for resistance to the parasitic plant Orobanche cumana. In our discussion of the paper, we have some suggestions for you to consider. In general, the mechanism of intracellular and extracellular penetration of haustorium has been discussed in parasitic plants. Therefore, we suggest that the main contribution of the article to the state of the art of parasitic plants should be made clear in the introduction, discussion, and conclusion. Title Line 2: I suggest including the name of the sunflower species and the plant families in the title, and removing the full stop. Line 5: What is the authors' affiliation? I suggest including this information. Key message Line 12: Please check the species name Helianthus annus L. It looks like a letter ""u"" ( Helianthus annu u s L.) is missing. Line 17: I suggest removing Orobanche cumana from the keywords, as it is already in the title, and adding another keyword to broaden the scope of article search. Introduction Line 42: I suggest including the author of Orobanche cumana. Line 43: Remove the comma. Line 44: Which component of the root exudates are you referring to? Could you specify? Line 54: Could you please provide the full name of the gene? Line 57: I believe it's important to specify how the phloem connection is established, as it has received less coverage in the literature compared to xylem connection. Line 72: I suggest leaving only 'Orobanchaceae' in the parentheses. Line 74: For standardization, include the family name 'Pelargonium zonale' and remove 'family' from the parentheses for 'Convolvulaceae.' The ending 'aceae' already indicates the family."" Materials and methods What is the sample number? I suggest including light microscopy and Toluidine Blue O staining analyzes in the text. Results and discussion Line 170: Insert a comma after “By contrast” Lines 181-183: I was intrigued by how the nutrient transfer process occurs in the early stages. Do you have any hypotheses? Figures: It would be interesting to insert an acronym in the figures indicating parasite plant (P) and host plant (H), as well as the host and parasitic plant tissues. Figures: I suggest positioning the figures vertically, as the sections are longitudinal. Concluding remarks Could you provide answers to questions 2 and 3 and consider including at least one sentence addressing these questions posed in the introduction? References Lines 243, 286, 292, 294: Please check the reference pages. Line 254: Please verify whether the journal name should be abbreviated. Lines 255 and 258: Please check if the author's last name is Dos Santos or just Santos.

I do, however, have some reservations regarding the interpretations of the authors. 1) The authors suggest that individual amino acid residues shared between an allogeneic HLA antigen and a self-HLA antigen should be viewed as “self.” I view this act of classification as problematic. When a donor HLA antigen differs by one or more amino acids from a host HLA antigen encoded at the same locus, the entire protein is classified, at least from some perspectives routinely adopted in transplantation immunology, as non-self. One way to rationalize this view, which may conflict with the perspective expressed by the authors in this manuscript, is to suggest that what matters in antibody-antigen interaction are the thermodynamic roles of the amino acids that constitute HLA antigens, not their identities. The claim is that the relevant biochemical/biophysical properties of a given shared amino acid at a particular position in the primary structures of the self and allogeneic HLA molecules can be altered meaningfully as a consequence of the one to several amino acid differences between these proteins. For example, a lysine or tryptophan that is oriented slightly differently in the self vs. the allogeneic molecules or that is more or less likely to fluctuate in certain directions is not necessarily thermodynamically equivalent in the two proteins. 2) If the above assertion is accepted, then the claim that breaches of tolerance are critical for damage to the allograft is not demonstrated. While it is of interest to know that self-reactive B cells are generated it is not clear from this study that the antibodies produced by these B cells cause graft damage in vivo. While I acknowledge the evidence that autoreactive anti-A*24:02 antibodies can bind to allogeneic A*01:01 with potentially meaningful intrinsic affinities, that is a necessary but not sufficient condition for contributing meaningfully to clinical allograft tissue damage, especially in the context of a single patient with an autoimmune disease. Experiments designed to test the hypothesis, in a broader range of transplant patients, that such antibodies do contribute to allograft rejection episodes would be of interest. In the context of the potential role of autoantibody responses in allotransplantation, it has been accepted for some years that generation of autoantibodies to a variety of proteins can accompany alloimmune responses to an allograft. Some investigators have offered evidence that the presence of such antibodies is associated with damage to allografts. At present, I do not think we know with certainty the extent to which, if at all, such autoantibodies contribute to allograft damage or whether they can do so in the absence of pathogenic alloantibodies.",2023-10-02T17:42:18,,Neil Greenspan,10.1101/2023.03.31.534734,B cell and antibody targeting of transplant alloantigen epitopes is supported by both self and allo-recognition,"John T.

We collectively agreed it's an exciting contribution to understanding how biological invasions shape invasive species' trophic niche and functional morphology in new environmental contexts. We all think the manuscript is well written and the figures are excellent! During our discussion, a major point that came up deals with how the hypothesis (lines 88-90) is motivated and then connected with the results. A more conceptual contextualization of the hypothesis in the introduction (e.g., explaining the ecological release hypothesis in the 3rd paragraph) could help readers to generalize the results beyond the study system and attract a more diverse readership interested in niche variation and biological invasions. Also, as the results combine a substantial body of statistical analyses aiming to understand variation in functional morphology and trophic niches across species, ontogenetic stages, sexes, and invaded vs. native ranges, presenting predictions after the hypotheses could help readers to navigate the results. For example, in light of the ecological release hypothesis, what is expected regarding morphological and body size variation across native and invaded areas? Our final point of discussion is related to the interpretation of the observed niche contraction in the invaded range. As replicates representing invaded vs. native ranges are sampling sites in space (Fig. 1), clarifying whether observed niche contraction emerges via lower variability in resource use across sites and/or within sites would be interesting. This is a key point to connect the results with the ecological release hypothesis. I hope you find these comments constructive; discussing this manuscript in our journal club was great.

We collectively agreed it's an exciting contribution towards a more efficient and comprehensive use of camera traps as a powerful tool to monitor biodiversity. We appreciated the concerns the authors had to create a user-friendly and flexible approach, which will certainly appeal to a diverse public of ecologists and wildlife biologists. As tropical ecologists, most of the questions that came up during our discussion were related to applying this approach to tropical, species-rich ecosystems. For instance, we wondered whether models would perform similarly (e.g., classification accuracy) in megadiverse communities where the local pool of species is larger and morphological variation (both across and within species) may also be amplified. Would this imply having a more robust training set? We understand this is not something trivial to predict based on the current set of species, but a deeper exploration of how species' traits influence prediction accuracies would be very welcome in this direction. For example, does the model have lower performance for species with smaller body sizes and/or coloration more similar to the background? Or perhaps within groups of species that are more similar in size? We also wondered whether detection and classification accuracy varies across diurnal and nocturnal records, which could bias predictions. Congrats on developing such a powerful tool for ecologists and wildlife biologists, and good luck with the next steps of this work!
