How are you thinking about the patchy GC-PC connectivity in terms of learning specific tasks? I read through your review article but I am not sure if I understand your claim. One point I understood was the idea that different learned behaviors strengthen different combinations of GC-PC synapses. But could you clarify what you mean when you say ""task-dependent optimal coding level should be somehow nested in a relatively invariant anatomical frame""?",2022-09-15T13:46:16,marjoriexie,Marjorie Xie,10.1101/2022.08.15.504040,Task-dependent optimal representations for cerebellar learning,"Marjorie Xie, Samuel Muscinelli, Kameron Decker Harris, Ashok Litwin-Kumar",2022-08-15

The comments were synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. The study reports two two Bcl-2 family proteins, BNIP5 and Bcl-G, which inhibit Bak-dependent apoptosis through engagement of MODE 2 inhibition. The BH3 domains of these proteins act as selective Bak activators, while not inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins, leading to increased binding of activated Bak to Mcl-1, which prevents apoptosis. The reviewers raised a couple of questions about the methodology and several other suggestions for the paper, outlined below: Methodology Throughout the study various BH3 mimetics are used, but the combinations in which they are used and/or the doses employed could be more clearly reported. For example, in Figure 1E and 1F ABT-737 and S63845 are used at 1 μM.  Then, in Figure 1H, A-331852 is substituted for ABT-737 in combination with S63845 and the concentration is not reported. In Figure 1H, ABT-737 and S63845 are used again, but this time at a concentration of 2 μM each. Other concentrations are used  in Figures 2, 3, and 5.  There seems to be a dose-response assay in Figure 3B, but it is used for a specific use case. It would be beneficial to report all combinations and doses employed, and the rationale for them in the main text, to allow readers to fully interpret the data presented. In various figures, there is a concern about the statistical approach to calculate p-values based on multiple measurements or cells within each sample. The t-test and ANOVA assume that each measurement is independent, and multiple nuclei within the same sample are not independent. Recommend either not reporting p-values or averaging together the values from each biological replicate to calculate the p-value using those sample-level means. For more information, see https://doi.org/10.1371/jou... and https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb... Specific comments Introduction ‘ The two MOMP effectors Bcl-2 associated x (Bax) and Bcl-2 antagonist killer (Bak) are inactive in resting cells as these cells exhibit low levels of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (e.g. BIM)....and some are additionally able to activate Bax and Bak (sensitizers and direct activators, e.g. BIM)’ - Recommend revising the fragment for clarity, adding references to support the statements and possibly an introductory figure to help visualize the proteins involved. Introduction, last paragraph ‘ We found that two Bcl-2 proteins, Bcl-2 interacting protein 5 (BNIP5) and Bcl-G, act as selective inhibitors of Bak-dependent but not Bax-dependent apoptosis…’ - The fragment is unclear, BNIP5 and Bcl-G are first reported as Bak-inhibitors, then activators and back to inhibitors. Does this mean to describe protein-protein interaction and changes in conformation? Figure 1 - Recommend using a different color scheme for Figure 1E to assist visual interpretation of the results, in particular consider using a color-blind friendly color palette. - ‘ colony formation (F)’ - The text later on refers to ‘clonogenic survival’, would it be possible to clarify in the legend or text what is being assessed, i.e. recovery assay, clonogenic survival or colony formation? - Figure 1G - Please clarify whether 2 uM of each are used in this experiment. - ‘ We transduced PC9 lung cancer or A375 melanoma cells…’ - It is nice to see that different cell lines were assessed to address any cell line-specific effects. Would be interesting to see if this effect occurs in normal cell lines and not just cancer cell lines. Figure 2 -  The inline color-coded legends are useful when bars are displayed but in the figure several bars are close to zero, consider an alternative method to label the bars. Results ‘...suggesting posttranscriptional regulation of Bak levels by BNIP5 ’ - Maybe large proteome databases of multiple cell lines (e.g CCLE) can be datamined to determine the correlation between BNIP and Bak expression? Figure 3B, 3D and 3E - Please clarify the concentrations used for each treatment in the figure legend. Methods, Cell viability and cell death measurements - The study assessed cell death or cell viability with either live cell imaging, or in fixed cells, can the methodology for this be elaborated upon? Also, propidium iodide staining is used in several sections of the results, recommend adding information about this under the Methods section. Methods - There are several missing references in the Methods section. Suggest adding Supplemental Figure 6 as a graphical abstract.",2022-09-15T07:03:40,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2022.07.24.499430,Anti-apoptotic BH3-only proteins inhibit Bak-dependent apoptosis,"Sebastian Ruehl, Clifford S.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.12.503767v1#comment-5982853631,biorxivstage,2,"Review coordinated via ASAPbio’s crowd preprint review This review reflects comments and contributions by Ashley Albright, Luciana Gallo, Sam Lord, Dipika Mishra, Claudia Molina, Arthur Molines, Sónia Gomes Pereira, Parijat Sil, Rinalda Proko. The comments were synthesized by Richa Arya. The reviewers like the motivation behind the study as a lot is still unknown about the impact of fluorescent tags on various mechanisms in biology. The work is impactful. However we outline below some major questions and several minor points: 1.	Related to the data analysis: The findings are valuable however the analyses may not be sufficiently sensitive to pick up morphological changes. Maybe other more sensitive approaches for measuring interference in the biology of these neurons could also be tested, like bulk growth rates, a stimulus added to the culture medium or other? Some of the phenotypes (see Figure 1D and Figure 3D) are relatively subtle and the manuscript relies heavily on statistics to support the claims. Independent of the statistics, the differences are not striking by eye examination. Perhaps more data is necessary to bolster some of the reported claims. As continuation to the expression analysis, it is important to estimate the expression levels of the actin binding probes used, in order to rule out the fact that some of the observed differences between LifeACT-GFP and AC-GFP may be due to discrepancies in the extent of overexpression of these probes. It would greatly add to the study to include, at least for some of the phenotypes, whether the measured parameters respond to the low versus high expression levels of the same probe. 2.	Related to the transient expression: Figure 1: The transient expression method used in the manuscript shows a lot of variability in expression levels, between cells, and between replicates. Expression levels could confound the interpretation. One of the constructs could be expressed more or less than the other, resulting in stronger or weaker phenotypes, not because it is more or less toxic than the other per se but because its expression level is different. It would be relevant to ""normalize"" for the expression level of each construct. Another way to circumvent this, at least partially, would be to substantially increase the number of cells analyzed, which would allow for a range of expression values to be represented in the data. 3. 	Related to FRAP analysis Last paragraph result 1:  ‘ and depends only on their affinity to F-actin, that is similar in AC-GFP and LifeAct-GFP (Figure 1A, Figure 1B, Supplementary Video 1). In addition, our results suggest that even without photomanipulation, minor changes in actin reorganization cannot be revealed when using actin-binding probes… ’ - Based on the images reported, it is not possible to establish how much of the signal is due to the population of probes being bound to actin versus the population that is free floating in the cytoplasm. The recovery could be due to the diffusion of free-floating probes and therefore give no information about affinity for actin. EGFP alone was used as a baseline for cytoplasmic diffusion, the slower recovery from the EGFP-actin implies that some portion of the EGFP-actin is incorporated in filaments. Recommend replacing  ""Affinity"" with ""relative ability to incorporate into filaments.""  A possibility to address the issue of size-based diffusion in cytoplasm is to complete FRAP measurements in latrunculin-treated cells that depolymerize most of the actin filaments. This will enable to set a baseline for each of the probes here (which will now probably be either free or G-actin bound) and provide a complement to the Jasplakinolide treatment. ‘ In addition, our results suggest that even without photomanipulation, minor changes in actin reorganization cannot be revealed when using actin-binding probes. ’ - There has been only two actin binding probes tested, both with similar turnover as measured in FRAP in their own assay. It might be worth making a comparison in this experiment with a very strong actin binding probe as control, such as Utrophin. 4. 	Figure 2: Theat measurement shown is not a very good proxy for filopodia motility. The study used an intensity-weighted center of mass. This means that the center of mass moves, not only because the shape of the filopodia changes but also because the signal intensity changes. In other words, the shape of a filopodia could be constant (no motility) and yet have a center of mass that moves because the mCherry signal fluctuates inside it. This could be avoided if the center of mass of the shape is used, not weighed by intensity.  This is especially a concern because the signal from the cytoplasmic mCherry is used for the analysis. If a folipodia locally thickens in the Z-direction, the cytoplasmic signal will increase locally, displacing the intensity weighted center of mass even if the 2D contour has not changed. Using a membrane signal would provide a better alternative. It would also be possible to make use of the resource Filotracker, that tracks the length of the filopodia as a measure of filopodia dynamics. Find the paper and the resource here: https://www.molbiolcell.org... 5. 	Result 2 last para, ‘ We found no significant difference in center of mass displacement between actin probe expressing cells and EGFP expressing control filopodia (Figure 2B)… ’. This section needs more clarity and evidence to conclude that the probes do not alter filopodia dynamics. Maybe filopodia growth rate or some additional measurements? Failing to find significance does not equate to finding evidence of absence. It may be that this one parameter is not sufficiently sensitive. Maybe this possible uncertainty should be discussed in the last sentence of the paragraph, to note that the data highlights the possibility that the tested actin labeling proteins do not interfere. Minor Comments Introduction: ‘Actin is a key cytoskeletal element in mammalian cells involved in many cellular mechanisms ’. mammalian cells can be replaced with eukaryotic cells. It would also be nice to mention some of the cellular mechanisms involved such as cell division, and migration, among others. Introduction: it would be good to describe the various phenotypes observed in previous studies when actin was labeled or when actin-binding proteins were used. It would give readers context about the level of toxicity and what phenotypes to expect. Introduction last paragraph: ‘…and to exclude certain actin structures from labeling (Munsie et al., 2009)’ : one more reference could be added for this statement: Sanders et al., 2013 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go... Figure1: It would be nice to have grayscale images of the actin channel in addition to the overlay. Figure 1 B, C: For all of the FRAP recovery curves, recommend providing insets, zooming in on the first 30 to 60 sec of the recovery, as that's when most of the recovery happens. The last 120 sec of the plots show a ""flat"" plateau. Figure 1D, in the fluorescence recovery plateau %."" In addition, our results suggest that even without photo manipulation, minor changes in actin reorganization cannot be revealed when using actin-binding probes."" This claim relies on the p-values. In looking at Figure 1D, left panel, EGFP-actin (orange) dots there appears to be an outlier. Independent of the outlier, the collection of dots does not appear that different by eye, recommend providing additional data to support this claim. Result 1: ‘ In Jasplakinolide-treated neurons, as expected, we observed an almost immediate recovery of fluorescence in the EGFP expressing group, whereas the EGFP-actin signal did not recover… ’. The fact that the EGFP-actin signal did not recover is surprising. Normally not all of the actin present in the protrusion is incorporated into filaments, some of it is floating around freely. Hence, some of the signal should be recovering, even after stabilization of the actin filament, simply due to diffusion. For example, the EGFP signal recovers in presence of Jasp. due to diffusion of the free-floating probe. Recommend some discussion about the absence of recovery for the EGFP-actin. Figure 2A: ‘ Red lines show the movement track of intensity weighted center of mass.. ’. The red dots for the center of mass cluster and overlap, recommend color coding the dots so that it is clear visually what the displacement of the center of mass was and showing an overlay of the contours used for the analysis. Additionally, in the Supplementary Video 2 it looks like EGFP and EGFP-actin centers of mass are more displaced than AC-GFP or LifeAct-GFP. It would be good to clarify if this is exactly the same example as shown in the figure. Figure 2B: ‘ Average intensity-weighted center of mass displacement over 60s time periods…’ Why was only a 60 sec interval considered when there are  images up to 120 sec and the video goes until 180 sec? Additionally, please specify if these are the first 60 sec of imaging. Result 3: It is known that expression levels of actin binding probes can alter actin structures and their dynamics. It would have been great to do the following: (a) estimate the levels of expressed lifeact-GFP/AC-GFP and see how they compare with each other, (b) note or look for phenotypic differences as a function of the expression levels of these probes. It might be worth plotting the spine morphometric data in categories of low, medium and high expression levels of the two actin binding probes as well as EGFP-Actin (since this can affect nucleation/treadmilling etc at very high expression levels). Just as the identity of the actin binding probe being used is an important consideration in studies of actin dynamics, so is the expression levels of these probes. Result 3: use p-values to compare different cell lines, the n used in the statistics should be the number of samples, not the number of spines. Result 3: ‘ This is like due to the known high background fluorescence level of LifeAct, originating from its affinity to G-actin (Melak, Plessner and Grosse, 2017)… ’. Actin chromobody is also known to bind G actin. Is there a significant difference in G Actin binding affinity for LifeACT versus AC that can account for this explanation? Figure 3C ‘ Expression of EGFP-actin or LifeAct-GFP for 24 hours did not influence total protrusion density’ - Please indicate whether these morphological analyses were done blinded as to what the cells were expressing, or any steps taken to reduce bias. Figure 3D: There is a similar concern here as for Figure 1D. Here the number of cells is higher, but the density of the points is not shown. By eye the box plots do not look very different, violin plots may be better for these data so that the distribution of data points is more apparent. Figure 3F: it would be useful to have a representative image of each (stubby, thin, and mushroom) class, to help non-experts better visualize what's being analyzed . Result 4, paragraph 1, ‘..whether dendritic arborization is altered within 24 h after the transfection of the tested probes… ’ All the experiments were performed 24h after transfection, would it be worth testing different time intervals (e.g. 12-16h and/or 48h)? Result 4C,D E:  suggest adding quantification to enhance the data. Materials and Methods section, ‘ Live cell imaging and FRAP experiments,  post-bleach in every case (Supplementary Video 2)… ’.

It seems like the main benefit of BO is that it could require less forward passes through the network to find a binder with high pLDDT, but since extra time is required to embed the sequence with uniref, train the MLPs and find the gradient, it’s not clear how significant the speed up will be. Regarding the alphafold predictions of your design and the patgiri peptide, it seems like loop 1 is collapsed into the protein domain, as opposed to wrapping around the peptide, as one might expect it to given the Ras-SOS complex (PDB ID: 1NVW). Do you think it’s possible that alphafold is struggling to model the binding of the patgiri peptide due to the flexibility of the loops, and that is responsible for the abnormally low pLDDT? Have you considered using alternative methods, like openfold (which has different weights) or Rosetta PIPER-FlexPepDock to test whether this peptide is predicted to bind?",2022-09-15T01:35:35,disqus_cu4BzT8xKH,Sebastian Swanson,10.1101/2022.08.05.502972,Now What Sequence?

The better way to think about the error in the genetic predictors of gene expression is not to change the null hypothesis but in terms of an error in variables problem. Under reasonable assumptions of independence between reference and target sets, error in variables leads to attenuation and not inflation. Many papers have addressed this problem.

I like the approach of performing repellency tests with a higher throughput assay but having an exit hands-on-cage (real-world) assay. A few relevant issues occurred to me, which the authors may want to consider: 1) It might be more appropriate to report repellency in terms of protection (per EPA & WHO guidelines). Also, it seems that 75% repellency is too low. A good repellent should provide approximately 100% protection for a couple of hours. 2) As you know, the core principle of scientific publication is to provide enough information that a qualified person can perform the work. Several qualified researchers could test whether the newly discovered repellents are indeed more effective than DEET. However, the names of the new repellents, their sources, and chemical characterization (if newly synthesized) were not disclosed. {Is there a SI file I missed?] 3) Suppose there is an issue of intellectual property. In that case, this issue should be addressed first, and then the work should be considered for publication with a complete list of compounds tested, particularly those claimed to be more effective than DEET. Other minor issues for your consideration: 1) In the introduction, the sentence referring to the discovery of picaridin needs to be re-phrased. Picaridin was developed before insect ORs were discovered, let alone the co-receptor Orco. 2) Insect ORs are not G-protein coupled receptors, as implied in the introduction.

Re: On the therapeutic potential of MAPK4 in triple-negative breast cancer Feng Yang Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas * Corresponding Author: Feng Yang, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX, 77030. Phone: 713-798-8022; Fax: 713-790-1275; E-mail: fyang@bcm.edu Boudghene-Stambouli et al. recently published “On the therapeutic potential of MAPK4 in triple-negative breast cancer” in BioRxiv concerning our Nature Communications publication, “MAPK4 promotes triple negative breast cancer growth and reduces tumor sensitivity to PI3K blockade.”, published 11 January 2022 (1). We want to reply to their comments as follows. Boudghene-Stambouli et al. essentially detected a similar MAPK4 protein expression pattern (Our report (1) vs. Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Fig. 1c) in the human TNBC cells, when using the same commercially available antibody AP7298b. However, they claimed, “We failed to detect a specific ERK4 band in any of the cell lines, including Hs578T cells transfected with human ERK4 cDNA.” They then used their own “validated custom polyclonal ERK4 antibody that we use routinely in our laboratories” to produce a different MAPK4 expression pattern (Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Fig. 1c). They provided a siRNA knockdown for the “validation” of their antibody. In this case, Boudghene-Stambouli et al. largely ignored our previous publications using the commercially available AP7298b to successfully confirm the overexpression, knockdown (up to five independent shRNAs), and knockout of MAPK4 in many human cancer cell lines and in “normal” cells (1-4). AP7298b can also detect a purified GST-MAPK4 fusion protein in the GST pulldown assays and the purified Flag/His-tagged wild-type and mutated MAPK4 proteins in the in vitro kinase assays (2). It should be noted that instead of our extensive validation of AP7298b using many MAPK4-overexpressing, knockdown (up to five independent shRNAs), and knockout cells as well as purified MAPK4 proteins (overexpressed/purified from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells), Boudghene-Stambouli et al. only used a single siRNA to “validate” their un-named custom antibody. Besides, they did not confirm HA-MAPK4/Erk4 overexpression in their Hs578T cells (Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Fig. 1c). Please note, due to the sensitivity of different antibodies, even if an HA-positive western blot is provided, it may not confirm significantly increased ectopically overexpressed MAPK4 expression over the endogenous MAPK4. Finally, their custom antibody detected many non-specific bands compared to AP7298b (Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Suppl. Fig. 1c, which was included in their submission recently rejected by [Journal name redacted to follow bioRxiv's policy] after peer-review). Therefore, we have concerns over Boudghene-Stambouli et al.’s concern on MAPK4 protein expression levels in the MAPK4-high TNBC cell lines that we used in our study (1). It is well-known that mRNA and protein abundances may not correlate well in biological systems. Therefore, Boudghene-Stambouli et al.’s concern about the variation of MAPK4 mRNA expression across the cell lines will not carry that much weight. We also noticed that Boudghene-Stambouli et al. used our reported 5’ primer but a modified 3’ primer for their qPCR data in Fig. 1a. We wonder whether they have performed qPCR using our reported 5’ and 3’ primers to detect MAPK4 expression (3), and what were the results? Besides, although we have not systematically examined MAPK4 mRNA expression in human TNBC cell lines as we did for human prostate cancer cell lines (3), we did qPCR confirmed MAPK4 expression in MDA-MB-231, SUM159, as well as the non-small cell lung cancer H1299 cells. Besides, Zheng et al. independently showed MAPK4 mRNA and protein expression in HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231 cells (5), two of the TNBC cell lines concerned by Boudghene-Stambouli et al. Without knowing the quality of Boudghene-Stambouli et al.’s RNA-seq data, we could not comment on their Fig. 1b data. Another concern of Boudghene-Stambouli et al. is their failure to verify our reported MAPK4-AKT signaling axis, a conclusion drawn from their Fig. 2 data. Without providing their data, the corresponding author Dr. Meloche has communicated with me about this issue. At that time, I provided the following answer. “I am not sure if you did a transient transfection in the 293 cells. Unlike MK5, phosphorylation of AKT is subjected to many more direct and indirect regulations in the cells. It is hard to imagine that you can easily detect MAPK4 phosphorylation of cell endogenous AKT in the transiently transfected 293 cells. It can be a hit and miss, especially if you do not carefully monitor cell confluency. I think that we only reported data from the stable 293T cells overexpressing MAPK4 or MAPK4 phosphorylating a co-transfected AKT in 293T cells. In the latter case, we suspect that these ectopically overexpressed AKT are less susceptible to endogenous cellular posttranslational modifications and more susceptible to the regulation of overexpressed MAPK4. Again, unless you can’t repeat our data, such as MAPK4 phosphorylating a co-transfected AKT in 293T cells, I do not see a common ground for our debate here either.” Now I see the experimental data, and Boudghene-Stambouli et al. did perform a transient transfection and tried to detect phosphorylation change of endogenous AKT, which we have already expressed concern about in our previous personal communications. Interestingly, as a positive control for their Fig. 2 data, Boudghene-Stambouli et al. showed MAPK4 enhanced the phosphorylation of an ectopically overexpressed but not endogenous MK5, raising concern about this so-called positive control per se. We are also unsure how much MAPK4 was overexpressed compared to endogenous MAPK4 (Western blots on GFP could not provide that information) nor the nature of the seemingly increased AKT T308 phosphorylation in the MAPK4 transfected 293 cells (Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Fig. 2). I want to finish this discussion using what I wrote to Dr. Meloche in another email. “Without detailed information from your side, it is hard for me to guess what happened. I want to emphasize several technical details that may help. 1. Please collect cells at about 50%-70% confluency. If your lab collected cells at very high confluency, please try this. 2. We have been using Dox-inducible knockdown and overexpression approaches. We typically maintain the cell culture without Dox induction and do a couple of days (such as three days) induction just before the experiments. 3. If you use a non-induction system as we did in some of our studies, please ensure that you only use the engineered cell lines at early passages. You can do this by freezing down many vials from a very early passage and only using the thawed-out cells for minimal additional passage(s). The cancer cells in culture may adapt to the cellular “stress” from long-term MAPK4 overexpression or knockdown.” We welcome open discussions based on solid experimental data. We will do our best to help if any group meets technical difficulty in repeating our data under the reported experimental conditions. We have validated our MAPK4-AKT signaling in more than 20 human cancer cell lines (Ref. (1-3), and unpublished data), and additional independent reports also confirmed MAPK4 phosphorylates/activates AKT in human cancer cells (5, 6). We welcome and are looking forward to more independent studies in this area. References 1. Wang W, et al.

I really love the inventiveness of the experimental set up! The results are really unexpected. The finding that phosphate starvation proceeds ABA mediated drought responses is interesting on a mechanistic basis and will likely have direct implications for crop management practices. The field-to-lab experimental pipeline looks really effective and I look forward to more people taking up this approach. I do have a couple of points that I believe the authors could discuss in more depth. In their ridge trials, the geometry of the soil may play a role. Phosphate starvation induces a lot of lateral roots close to the soil surface, to maximise phosphate capture. In the ridge set-up, lateral roots are restricted to only a single plane. Is it possible that this contributes to the PSR in ridge-grown plants? It is also possible that increased rooting depth under mild-drought treatment also reduces phosphate uptake. If the authors see a reduction in PSR gene expression after re-watering ridge plants, this may help to rule out geometric explanations. It should be noted that the pot experiments do already indicate this to some extent. I am also not so sure about the authors’ conclusion on why PSR is induced at mild drought but suppressed under severe drought “Under severe drought conditions, given the circumstantial evidence, our observations would support the notion that PSR induction is suppressed by a relative increase in Pi concentration due to a decrease in leaf water content (Fig. 4).” I would argue an alternative, more straight forward hypothesis, that plants simply prioritise drought stress over this level of phosphate starvation when drought is severe. Would the authors expect to see a recovery of the PSR if Pi levels dropped even lower? Once again, thanks to the authors for their very through-provoking study!

The comments were synthesized by Ehssan Moglad. The study conducted by Doyle et al. aimed to test the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) transfer activity of the human ORP5 protein via orthogonal targeting of different sites of membrane contact, namely, between the plasma membrane (PM) and the mitochondrial outer membrane. Major comments Figure 1: The idea behind the experiment is great, however, there are some questions about the data presented: - Recommend using better representative images, the morphology of the cells in panels B and C appears distorted, are these cells undergoing some death? This would make interpretation of the data difficult. - In Figure 1B, the control experiment should be done with a known mitochondrial marker to test if the construct works as expected. - P14P measurement using the P4M probe is unclear from the images and quantification provided. Please provide a multi-plane image of the probe showing its distribution on the PM and at the ER-PM or ER-mito contact site. - Please provide an additional graph to show the relative change of PI4P at the PM compared to the rest of the cell or respective contact site. - For a better comparison, recommend showing the normal (control) distribution of PI4P in the images. Results: ‘ As expected, we did not see the accumulation of PI4P at these contact sites (see graph in Fig. 1C), presumably due to SAC1 activity in the ER. Instead, the fluorescence of PM PI4P seemed to decline ’: Please indicate whether this result is statistically significant. Figure 2: The experiment with the FKBP-PI4KC1001 construct is not discussed in the text. Also, further clarification would be helpful for the results presented in panel B. In +SAC1mito, it is showing accumulation after Rapa treatment, please discuss why PI4P is not showing accumulation. 'The rationale was that without inhibition of PI4P synthesis, observing reductions in PM PI4P catalyzed by transport of PI4P out of the PM would require a rate that exceeded synthesis, which may not be possible through reduced flux at the much smaller surface area of induced PM-mitochondria contact sites, compared to ER-PM contact sites (compare Figs. 1C and D). We also imaged by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) to more sensitively detect changes in PM PI4P with the high-affinity PI4P biosensor, P4Mx2.': Recommend revising the fragment for clarity. Figure 3: The shape of the cells across figure 3 varies substantially, can some text be added to discuss why this is the case? Figure 3: The authors have already shown in a previous paper that SAC1 predominantly acts only in the 'cis' configuration. However, induced coupling of overexpressed ORP between ER-PM and mito-PM using rapamycin might bring these membranes closer than usual or cause the formation of more membrane contact sites. Thus, there may be some possibility for SAC1 to act in 'trans'. Alternatively, there could be indirect changes in PM PI4P due to increased activity of endogenous ORP5 at these induced contact sites. To address this: - Would it be possible to confirm if there was an increase in the number/size of contact sites by checking for mapper expression and localization when ORP5 constructs are expressed and coupled with Rapamycin? Lipid binding mutants of ORP5 could also be used to show that those lipid binding mutants do not cause a depletion upon coupling with Rapamycin. - For experiments where SAC1 (Fig 3) was overexpressed along with FRB::FKBP-ORP5-ΔTMD, please show control conditions where the SAC1 alone was expressed without the ORP5. Also, in a control condition where lipid binding mutants of ORP5 are expressed along with SAC1, there should be minimal effects on PM PI4P depletion compared to WT ORP5. Adding these controls will further confirm prior observations and substantiate the effects of FRB:: FKBP-ORP5-ΔTMD expression, and rule out any potential artifacts from overexpression of just SAC1. A major confound across all the experiments is the activity of endogenous ORP5 that is not measured. Is it possible to perform experiments (such as in Figure 3) where the endogenous ORP5 is downregulated using siRNA or shRNA and a siRNA/shRNA-resistant version of ORP5 is overexpressed in this background? There could be potential compensatory effects from other ORP5, and this would require simultaneous knockdown of multiple ORPs. Minor comments Figure 1: It could be helpful to start Figure 1 using a scheme of the two hypotheses on how ORP5 regulates PI4P levels at the plasma membrane. This will help easily assess the data presented in the Figures for and against the hypotheses. Figure 1A: It is difficult to see the co-localization in the current color scheme. It would be helpful to use a different color combination, provide zoomed-in images, or use pointers to highlight. Figures 1C and D: Please specify in the legend the timepoint when rapamycin was added and the subcellular membrane the measurements were made from. In discussion: 'In principle, this observation does not demonstrate lipid transfer (though it is compatible with it). Although tethering at a site of membrane contact seems to facilitate access of PI4P to SAC1, ORP5 could simply be presenting the lipid to the phosphatase, as opposed to depositing PI4P into the membrane for subsequent hydrolysis by SAC1. If ORP5 works in such a presentation mode, it is not clear to which membrane the resulting PI lipid is released: either back into the PM, or into the tethered membrane. In other words, lipid transfer is not necessarily part of the reaction '. Are there ways in which this can be tested? Suggest proposing some future experiments in the text.",2022-08-31T13:08:23,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2022.08.04.502856,Depletion of Plasma Membrane PI4P by ORP5 Requires Hydrolysis by SAC1 in Acceptor Membranes,"Colleen P.

Indeed, since our method is based on the number of reads at each location along the genome, sequencing-induced anomalies would in fact lead to spurious results if the method was used on unprocessed data. We have described our approach to reducing these effects in detail within the supplemental methods (Section IIIC, in particular subsections 2, 3, 4, and 10). In short, the analysis only uses loci that can be properly mapped. We first bin the reads into 1 kb regions, calculate the deviation of the reads from a 200 kb centered median, and then exclude the 10% most extreme 1 kb regions. We have found that this removes most (if not all) of the regions that have spurious local maxima/minima caused by the technical factors you've mentioned. In addition, for organisms in which there are known regions of poor compatibility with sequencing (Vibrio cholerae in particular), we have removed those anomalous regions by hand. We also use the standard method of dividing the exponential phase data by stationary phase data, since the sequencing-induced features are typically present in both cases. To further reduce the effects of noise, we have used the Akaike Information Criterion to select the ideal coarse-grained genomic resolution, thus optimizing the amount of signal we can obtain while minimizing the ability of noise and outliers to influence results. I hope that answers your question! Thank you so much for your interest in our pre-print!

The authors used distant Vespertilionids to place this root (instead, they could have used Kerivoulinae or Muriniae representatives, i.e. the sister-group of Myotinae, which would have been more effective in placing this root of Myotis).

Review synthesized by Bianca Melo Trovò. This study demonstrates the utility of an L-Methionine analog - ProSeMet - to tag and enrich proteins which have residues that are methylated in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that this can be used in combination with mass spectrometry to identify these sites. Overall this is a useful, well-verified and well-described approach that will be helpful for future identification and investigation of methylation sites. Major comments It would be helpful if the manuscript could additionally discuss the reversibility of methylation generally, and the reversibility of the modification of protein residues by the alkyne group specifically, in the discussion, and whether that has any implications for their results. It may be that the dynamics of methylation and demethylation vary between the two; or it may be that they are the same - either way, that may affect how they suggest others use this method and interpret its results. Perhaps related to the question of reversibility, it would be helpful if the manuscript would comment on whether these are “true” methylation sites or not; i.e. whether they consider all these methylation sites to be functional. Trying to determine this would be an interesting direction for future work, but for this study a reflection on whether these novel functional methylation sites are simply capable of being methylated, or are likely to be methylation sites that are meaningful biologically, would be helpful. Results, ProSeMet competes with L-Met to pseudo methylate protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus: the manuscript claims that ProSeMet is not incorporated into newly synthesized proteins but rather converted to ProSeAM and used by native methyltransferases. There does appear to be some reduction in the labeling with ProSeMet on cycloheximide treatment  in Figure 2D - could this suggest that it is incorporated into newly synthesized proteins as well as being converted to ProSeAM? If not, could the manuscript explain why not? This experiment clearly shows that in contrast to AHA labeling, there is still use of ProSeMet as a substrate when translation is inhibited; however, it is not clear how this demonstrates that it is not incorporated at all into newly synthesized proteins. If methyl has been incorporated in previously present proteins, perhaps this can be clarified in the text. Results, ProSeMet competes with L-Met to pseudomethylate protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus: the conclusion that “ Cell fractionation of the cytosolic and nuclear compartments followed by SDS-PAGE fluorescent analysis revealed no fluorescent labeling of the L-Met control ” is correct but may be overstated as there appears to be some background in the cytosolic fraction.

Results, ProSeMet-directed pseudo methylation is detectable in vivo: the manuscript reports that “mice starved prior to ProSeMet injection had increased ProSeMet labeling in the heart, whereas mice fed prior to ProSeMet administration had increased labeling in the brain and lungs”.

The comments were synthesized by Vasanthanarayan Murugesan. In this preprint, Hughes et al. describe the interaction between the ER protein PERK and the mitochondrial protein ATAD3A. During ER stress, PERK phosphorylates elF2a leading to reduced global protein synthesis. The authors show that increased interaction between PERK and ATAD3A during such stress attenuates elF2a phosphorylation locally around mitochondria, resulting in continued translation of mitochondrial protein despite a reduction in global protein translation. The authors present multiple lines of evidence to support this claim and the experiments were well performed. The findings may have important implications for the understanding of mitochondrial protein synthesis and the interactions between mitochondria and the ER. The following suggestions were raised: Experiments The manuscript would benefit greatly by measuring protein translation explicitly showing that mitochondrial protein translation is retained despite a reduction in global protein synthesis under certain conditions. That would help determine whether mitochondrial protein translation is protected under certain conditions driven by ATAD3 expression. The specificity of ATAD3A towards PERK activation requires further experimental validation. Some specific suggestions are: - Changes in activation of other pEIF2a kinases, such as GCN2 or PKR, could be measured to discard their involvement. - In Figure S2, protein levels of ATF6 should accompany changes in spliced XBP1. - ATF4 levels, a downstream marker of the signaling pathway, could be measured. Manuscript Recommend providing more details about the experimental protocol when treating cells with ER stressors. Different treatment durations are found throughout the manuscript (30min, 1h, 8h…). More information would be helpful in understanding the election of those time points for different experiments. In Figure 2, recommend including the blots for the downstream targets ATF4, GADD34 and CHOP at the 30 minutes time point, where the upstream activation starts. In Figure 2, the differences shown in the representative images for p-eIF2a and ATF4 appear milder than what is shown in the graph. In particular when compared with the interpretation of blots in Fig. S2. It is suggested to include all the blots used for quantification in Figure 2 in a supplemental figure so it can be clear how overexpressing/downregulating ATAD3A has a meaningful effect on this signaling pathway. Figure 2B shows 5 different (phospho)proteins using the same loading control blot. This approach would require stripping of the membrane after each blotting, can this be specified in figure legends and in the Materials & Methods. Was the membrane stripped after each blot or were different membranes used? If different membranes were used, please indicate so and present the individual beta-actin blots corresponding to each protein as a supplemental figure. In Figure 3A, arrows indicating the contact sites between ER and the mitochondria would be helpful in highlighting the colocalization of the two proteins. Please also provide scale bars for the images. In Figure 3D, the #contacts per mitochondria, it is important to specify the area of images analyzed.

Particularly noteworthy to us is that the inhibitor mycolactone binds in a different location in this study when compared with our previous structure of the same inhibitor bound to a ribosome-bound translocon, primed for co-translational translocation (Gerard et al Molecular Cell 79 406-15). The authors speculate that “Our data suggest that the density feature previously assigned as mycolactone is unlikely to be mycolactone.” While it is true that our previous structure has a resolution of ~5A in the region of the map attributed to mycolactone, and therefore also true that we cannot unambiguously place mycolactone in this density, we remain confident that this density is mycolactone for the following reasons: (i)	Our procedure involved incubation of microsomes with mycolactone at a concentration of ~0.3µM (compared with 100µM used by Itskanov) before detergent/digitonin treatment and purification of ribosome-associated Sec complexes. A similar sample was prepared without mycolactone. When these two protein complexes were studied by cryo-electron microscopy, the Sec translocon adopted a substantially different conformation when mycolactone-bound compared with free. The only difference between these two samples was the presence of mycolactone, indicating that this structural difference is due to mycolactone binding. (ii)	We confirmed the presence of mycolactone in our mycolactone-bound purified using mass spectrometry of a sample taken immediately before addition to grids for structural analysis. (iii)	Analysis of the electron density for the mycolactone-bound translocon did not reveal any density feature in the mycolactone-bound sample in the location of the binding site observed by Itskanov. Therefore ribosome-bound, mycolactone-bound translocon is different from Sec62/63-bound, mycolactone-bound translocon. (iv)	The only additional density feature observed in the ribosome-bound, mycolactone-bound translocon is that which we have attributed to mycolactone and molecular dynamics simulations confirm that mycolactone is stable in this binding site. It is therefore our view that we did not misattribute the electron density into which we have placed mycolactone. Instead, it is our view that the difference between these two structures is likely to be genuine and mechanistically interesting. There are possible technical differences which could account for the different binding sites observed when comparing our structure with that of Itskanov: •	While we added mycolactone to the Sec translocon while still in the native membrane environment of microsomes, and then extracted the mycolactone-bound complex, Itskanov added to mycolactone to translocon after its purification and integration into  a non-lipid peptidisc. Our model for how mycolactone reaches its binding site in our system relies on translocon “breathing” within the physiological situation of a lipid bilayer, and mycolactone itself being present in this bilayer. It is not known if the translocon within a peptidisc is able to undertake similar “breathing”, nor how highly hydrophobic mycolactone may interact with this material. •	While we used native canine microsomes, Itzkanov et al used a hybrid translocon, comprised of human transmembrane regions and yeast extracellular regions. It is not known if this hybrid translocon is functional for translocation, or whether the translocation of model substrates by it is inhibited by mycolactone. •	There is also a large difference in mycolactone concentration used in the different studies. Mycolactone is effective at sub-nM concentrations on live cells. To provide sufficient molar ratios of mycolactone in concentrated microsomes, we used ~300nM in our studies, while Itskanov used the much higher concentration of 100µM mycolactone. It would be interesting to know whether this was the minimal concentration required for them to see binding, indicating a lower affinity binding site, or was simply the concentration selected. While there are technical differences which might account for the different binding sites observed, there is also the far more interesting possibility that both studies have correctly identified binding sites for mycolactone and that this inhibitor acts differently in post-translational and co-translational translocation. The Sec translocon can act through either a post-translational (involving Sec62/63) or a co-translational (involving ribosomes) mechanism. McKenna, Simmonds and High have previously shown (PMID 26869228) that mycolactone-mediated blockade is different in these two systems. While mycolactone shows a broad effect, preventing co-translational translocation of a wide range of substrates, it has a more restricted effect during post-translational translocation, only affecting translocation of a subset of substrates. Together with the differences in mycolactone binding between these two structures, this suggests the intriguing possibility mycolactone might have two different binding sites; perhaps one site which occurs during co-translational translocation where mycolactone is stably wedged into the cytosolic side of the lateral gate (Gerard et al), and one site which operates in post-translational translocation and is more easily overcome by signal peptide binding (Itskanov et al). Future studies will be required to test this intriguing possibility.

Spinosaurus was less pneumatic than most giant theropods, but more so than typical large land mammals which have NSGs just below 1.0 – most swimming nonaquatic mammals keep their heads sufficiently above water partly by the upwards thrust of active swimming and are at risk of drowning if they become too tired. Estimating the NSG of atypical Spinosaurus is difficult, but it would have been significantly higher than that of ratites and perhaps a little below that typical of terrestrial mammals. Highly aquatic animals that use fairly conventional tetrapod limbs and/or sculling tails for swimming tend to be as dense as or denser than water, with some able to bottom walk including capybaras and hippos, the latter being too dense to surface swim and thus sporting a specific gravity of perhaps 1.1 (Larramendi et al. 2021). Highly aquatic crocodilians are in the area of 1.0. Flightless marine penguins are moderately pneumatic and buoyant. After using their highly hydrodynamically modified and powerful flippers to propel themselves to sometimes considerable depths, the buoyancy helps penguins return to the surface at a pace that minimizes both risk of the bends and energy expenditures when oxygen reserves are depleted (Sato et al. 2002). Those extreme circumstances do not apply to Spinosaurus. and its being pneumatic enough to be a little less dense than water also does not fit the standard adaptations for flipperless tetrapods that pursue prey underwater in shallows as crocodilians sometimes do. Nor does the large rigid, high drag sail. And the deep tail with its very tail slender neural spines assigned to the taxon is more similar to the display structures of nonaquatic basilisks than large bodied tail scullers (Sereno et al.). This paleoartist remains skeptical of Spinosaurus restorations with very reduced hindlimbs, that not yet being verified by any sufficiently complete, well-articulated spinosaur specimens that meet the paleoreconstruction criteria needed to verify a configuration that is so extraordinary for a theropod dinosaur.

I enjoyed reading it and I have a couple of questions/points of feedback that I would like to share. 1. Do I understand correctly that in lines 133-134 the authors state that higher percentages of read recruitment to donor MAGs suggest bacterial colonisation? This seems to me very indirect evidence and not a justifiable conclusion based on this observation alone. 2. In figure 1, Canada is shown slightly bigger than the other countries. Is this because the donors and patients from the current study are also from Canada? I could not find this information in the text. Furthermore, I like that the authors made a distinction between industrialised and less industrialised countries. Would it be possible to change the colours slightly (e.g. make the red magenta) to make it easier for colour blind people to see? Also, the blue and purple rows are somewhat difficult to distinguish for me. Is this intentional, as the donor and post-FMT recipient microbiota are supposed to be similar? 3. I find it interesting that the authors found that only 16 and 44% of donor microbial genomes were detected in all donor metagenomes, suggesting that only a minority of bacteria is stably present over longer periods. (Lines 180-182.) Have the authors considered doing similar analyses on these genomes to find if they are HMI and LMI bacteria? 4. I find the comparison made between short-read taxonomy and donor population detection (lines 184-188) a little difficult to follow. Would it be possible to rephrase this part or add a little explanation of what exactly is compared? 5. Lines 190-194 are also fascinating! Even with such small numbers, it is striking to see that more bacteria colonise from pills that from colonoscopic transfer. Could the authors speculate or provide additional info on why this may be the case? 6. From the final conclusion (lines 431-435) I gather that FMT or similar microbiota therapeutics are unlikely to (temporarily?) cure IBD. Do the authors have suggestions as to what might work better, and would they like to share their perspectives on promising new treatment options? 7. And finally, what do the ellipses in supplementary figures 2 and 3 represent? I suppose they show some sort of area around each cluster centroid. A few extra words of explanation in the figure captions would be nice. This information is also not easily found in the analysis scripts. (And by the way, it is wonderful that the authors share all code and instructions on how to reproduce the analyses!)",2022-08-25T15:11:03,,Sam Nooij,10.1101/2021.03.02.433653,Metabolic independence drives gut microbial colonization and resilience in health and disease,"Andrea R.

There are three primary interrelated contributions: -Assigning “responsibility” for different regions of the map to a model and then fitting GMM as a real space B-factor. This is a new way to model atomic B-factors, since it is done in real space, compared to reciprocal space in most other software. -Sampling an ensemble based on those B-factors. The major success of this paper was that the authors created a new ensemble method that samples within the B-factors to improve the fit of hundreds of cyro-EM maps, demonstrating that their method is robust and can be done in a high throughput manner. -Refinement procedures for composite maps based on smoothing of responsibility. The examples all seem to be from individual maps with different levels of resolution across the map, not from true composite maps (calculated from different masking procedures for example). This part was very confusing for us to follow and although there are methodological links to the B-factor assignment/ensemble modeling parts of the paper, it might be better explained in a separate manuscript. Major comments: 1. The introduction only briefly discusses B-factors and doesn’t lay out what is distinct about this method. For a contrast, sampling is discussed with references and contrast: “ The sampling itself is usually based on either molecular dynamics (MD)4,9, minimisation10, normal mode analysis and/or gradient following techniques11,12, or Fourier-space based methods2.” Similarly, B-factor refinement should be discussed. The way Phenix and Refmac handle it (real vs. reciprocal space), the limitations that the GMM addresses, etc. 2. With regard to sampling, there are other methods that are now similar for generating ensembles (the EMMI work from Vendruscolo and Bonomi for example). It would be useful to contrast the limitations of those methods and how this method is distinct. For example, this method seems likely to be much more computationally simple to run. It would also be good to benchmark against examples of those ensemble methods in terms of RMSF/inferred B-factors. 3. When you refer to the TEMPy-REFF models in each case study are they always ensemble models using segmentation? 4. How are the weights for each focus map decided for when creating a composite map? Stated in ‘combining focused maps into a single overall composite map, with optimal weights of the focused maps.’ (page 3) We think that more information on how you are generating ensembles belongs in the results section which will help clarify the paper. Some additional specifics we think would make this section strong include: Are the ensembles being created for different segments of the model (based on map segmentation) or the entire model? When creating an ensemble, what is the input model? Has it already gone through iterations of the map to model fitting? How are ensemble models represented? Please provide examples and discuss how you would like these models interpreted. 5. Please clarify how b-factors are represented in your ensemble models and input into maps. Furthermore, in the discussion you state ‘We address this challenge using B-factor estimation. We find, as previously shown by us and others, that an ensemble of equally-well fitted models represents this local variability better than a single model.’ (page 16). However, it is unclear how the b-factors integrate with the ensemble model to represent local resolution. Please clarify which part of your model correlates with local resolution. 6. On average, how many models were included in an ensemble? Please provide a graph of CCC values versus number of models in an ensemble for more examples (ie more than SI Figure 7). How are you thinking about the trade-off between a more complex model versus a small gain in CCC? How deterministic is this procedure? Can you repeat and compare at least one dataset? If you generate multiple ensembles starting from the same structure - do you get the same number of models out and are they similar? 7. If we understand the calculations correctly, the increase in CCC comes from those models being refined independently, not collectively (which makes the increase all the more impressive). Does this suggest the ensemble captures both precision and accuracy (as discussed here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... and therefore the sampling allows escaping of local minima in a clever way. Are there other examples like the His alternative conformation that can help speak to this? 8. When assigning responsibility for a part of the map that may be able to similarly explain two parts of the model, how does the method decide which part of the model should fit in that segment of the map? Please provide more insight on the interpretation of uncertainty of discrete positions of different sidechains as described in the sentence ‘ensemble adopting either (bottom inset), or uncertainty in the exact side chain confirmation (bottom inset) of two residues (Y76 and L78)’. How is uncertainty measured? Is the RMSF similar or comparable to what would be inferred by B-factors? Please compare the numbers you are reporting to other traditional refinement softwares such as REFMAC and Phenix. It’s unclear whether this is capturing anharmonic motions in a really different way or just sampling the B-factor harmonic component. Minor comments: 1. In Figure 1a, please provide more description about what you are representing with the blue and orange circles in the responsibility estimation. 2. How does your method represent very high resolution structures with low b-factors but high numbers of alternative conformers (specifically looking at PDBs: 7A4M, 7A5V of Apoferritin and GABA receptor). 3. In Figure 5a, please clarify how you are normalizing the B-factor. 4. Please deposit output models in Zonodo or some other public repository. 5. What does SMOCf stand for?

With respect to the academic age, in addition to the time take off for parental leave etc. another omission in the manuscript is that in some labs / countries it's common to not publish during their PhD and some labs / countries where it's mandatory to publish to pass their viva which is not taken into account in the academic age. In addition to this, the academic age does not take into account that some students might publish during their BSc or MSc or are included as co-authors on papers during their BSc or MSc. All of these affects the academic age metric without affecting the applicants ability or suitability to be awarded funding. The academic age also does not take into account any time spent in institutions where bullying and harassment has occurred affecting someone's productivity and I would argue this could effectively decrease someone's academic age. In addition the academic age metric could be misused by students and delaying their PhD publications to the last year of their PhD to decrease their academic age and make it come across as if they've got more potential compared to PhD students who didn't do this or weren't advised to do so. So to me the academic age just appears to be another metric that does not (accurately) reflect the applicants capabilities or even career stage. One of my main concerns with respect to the narrative CV and another query with respect to the preprint is related to the section in 'Interviews' on the narratives. (1) ""The interviews indicate that applicants disliked the amount of time needed to author narratives"". Based on my own personal experience (the narrative CV for an EPSRC grant caused major anxiety and was the single task that prevented me from submitting the grant proposal) I suspect that potential applicants with anxiety, caring responsibility, dyslexia, etc. will struggle a lot more with completing this task and as it did in my case prevent them from submitting their grant proposal. So did the authors attempt to investigate this, what is the authors opinion on this? Would including people that were not able to submit grant applications in the interviews and survey change the conclusion that the ""SciCV was a relevant and successful initiative""? (2) ""redundancy and the use of boastful language in narratives were also criticised by some reviewers."" To me this comes across as if the narrative CV will benefit those most with the best support or understanding how to 'play the system': the politicians, not the applicants with most potential to complete a research project successfully. Finally, my last query about the preprint is related to the final paragraph in the discussion: ""Not surprisingly, SciCV alone had only a limited effect on the adherence to DORA-conformity during evaluation. ... Other funding organisations experimenting with new, text-based CV format such as the Science Foundation Ireland report similar findings [10], highlighting the need for additional accompanying measures such as clear guidelines or training."" With (such) a limited effectiveness of the SciCV/narrative CV, I am curious how the authors come to the conclusion that the ""SciCV was a relevant and successful initiative"". Also, is it worth requiring applicants to put in significantly more effort creating such document for the submission for grant applications with limited effectiveness, and when even then still additional measures are needed for the process to be fair? The authors suggest such measures to be clear guidance and training, which, frankly, assessors and reviewers could easily ignore and let their personal (implicit or explicit) biases guide their assessment or review. So to me, the narrative CV, albeit well intended (and before trying to write one myself I thought this was/could be an amazing intervention) comes across as trying to make life of the reviewers and assessors more easy while creating significantly more work for the applicants, potentially preventing them from even submitting a grant application. Has the narrative CV/SciCV been compared to other interventions that create less work for the applicant and force reviewers/assessors to adhere to DORA and remove any chance for biases to guide assessments/reviews, such as double blind review (e.g.: https://smallpondscience.co...

We were aware of previous observations on Ca2+ leakage, but unfortunately, our current structures do not provide good insights into its mechanism. In all our inhibitor-bound structures, the pore of Sec61 is essentially closed by the plug, and thus it seems unlikely that the channel permeates Ca2+ through its pore in the observed conformations. However, like other structural studies, our study also comes with certain limitations, such as difficulties in gauging the dynamics of the channel complex. Also we cannot rule out other Ca2+ permeation paths besides the central pore. We believe that these aspects are something we will have to look into carefully in the future.
