Major changes made during the revision process include withdrawal of original findings in the preprint that were either not reproduced (stab injury experiment in adult fish), or weak (reduction of pH3+ cells in the telencephalon of 5-dpf larvae; reduction of PCNA+ cells in the Dp area of adult fish; logistic regression analysis of zebrafish locomotion), or not easily explainable (all the data obtained at the 10-dpf larval stage, including the rescue experiment). As a minor change, we repeated HPLC quantification of monoamine metabolites (except NA) on the same 11-mo samples: the new values are used in the published version. For all other major and minor changes due to new experiments added during the revision process, we refer to the published article.",2022-02-11T13:54:40,stefano_suzzi,Stefano Suzzi,10.1101/140608,Loss of Irrk2 impairs cell proliferation and neuronal regeneration in the zebrafish brain,"Stefano Suzzi, Reiner Ahrendt, Stefan Hans, Svetlana A.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.03.454888v1#comment-5726376499,biorxivstage,4,"Dear Fernando, thank you for your overall positive feedback, especially because it was given out of scientific interest and not to comply with a revision deadline. We followed the iter with the peer-reviewed journal and I am happy to say that the paper has now been published. We believe your comments really helped us in making a better paper and reaching this goal. We reply below to each of your points. Compatibly with the decision of turning the full-length article into a report you will see many of them integrated in the published version. - While covA is extensively explained in the Methods, it has too brief of a description in the beginning of the Results section, given its importance to the associated conclusions. I would dedicate a few more sentences to explaining the reasoning behind covA, before assuming that the reader will automatically know what one means as they continue reading the results. I was a bit confused at first as to what covA was exactly measuring, and I think it's a smart way of measuring ancestral contributions to traits, so a bit more motivation for its use would be useful. Thank you for your suggestion, we now introduced a paragraph at the beginning of results giving covA definition, formula and a simple interpretation of it, in order to guide the reader in the following sections. - I think it might be good to move the text describing the connection between covA and f-statistics to the Methods section, for people familiar with f-statistics to motivate its use this way. I also wouldn't say that ""covA(i,j) has no interpretation in terms of branch length because of the fictitious nature of pA, an allele frequency which only serves as balanced comparison for the ancestries under analysis"". After all, the ""populations"" used in f-statistics analysis are also artificial groupings of individuals that share more or less history, depending on the analysis at hand. We now moved all supplementary text, including this description, in the Methods section. In addition, we agree with your point and we reworded the sentence “ … which only include allele frequencies in actual populations, covA(i,j) has no interpretation …” into “ … which include allele frequencies in groups that portray actual populations, covA(i,j) includes p_A, an average allele frequency which only serves as balanced comparison for the ancestries under analysis.” - It might be useful to try to separate the Eastern Hunter-Gatherer and Caucasus Hunter-Gatherer into 2 ancestral candidate groups, rather than treating Yamnaya as an ancestral source. EHG, CHG and WHG have quite differentiated component ancestries, so this might help solve some of the correlation issues mentioned at the bottom of page 3? See, e.g. Lazaridis et al. 2017. Although we in principle agree with your comment, we preferred to keep Yamnaya as a source to avoid ancestral groups with lower sample size, as the number of aDNA samples attributed to CHG and EHG were way less at the time of the analysis. We considered adding a separate analysis using them in place of Yamnaya to strengthen the results obtained with our original settings but as the correlation between Yamnaya  and WHG were inconspicuous in our main results (Fig 2), plus having to cope with space issues, we eventually left the analysis for future works. - The study would greatly benefit from examining the behavior of the covA statistic using simulations of a phenotype (say, in SLiM, see, for example, the recent preprints by Yair and Coop (2021) and Carlson et al. (2021)). The authors mention the interdependence inherent to the fact that the same reference populations are used, and I am concerned about what other factors might contribute to the behavior of the statistic, including, for example: 1) varying levels of negative selection operating on a trait, 2) the bias inherent to the fact that some ancestral populations might be closer to the present-day population on which the trait was measured, 3) effective size of the ancestral contributing population under study, 4) heterogeneity of the average ""reference"" populations used as baselines for comparison and 5) sample sizes of the ancestral populations (e.g. low sample size for the Siberians). We agree on this. Yet, as other reviewers did not raise this issue and the editors requested greater conciseness rather than more results, we limited ourselves to better underline the small simulation we performed at the beginning of the results section (previously covered only in Supplementary Information). We acknowledge that this does not answer most (if any) of the points you listed, but we hope this can be covered in a follow up analysis to extend the applicability of covA. In addition, we are reassured in the interpretation of our results by covA solidity in our simple simulation together with the high support of the discovered signals in the literature. - The authors say that ""those counties for which the covA distribution is significantly different than the rest of Estonia (two-tailed Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, p ≤0.001)."" It seems like a large number of counties have an asterik. I wonder if *all* counties would have an asterisk if one had chosen a more standard p-value cutoff? Why was this cutoff chosen? What would be the null sampling distribution here for what one would call significant? That each county would have the same distribution of this statistic as the whole country? Yes, the hypothesis tested is that the distribution of each county is the same as the rest of Estonia, assuming that the latter is comparable to the distribution of the whole country. We don’t believe that such a hypothesis is representative of reality, but is just a way of measuring local deviations in covA. The choice of 0.001 as significance cutoff was a rough way to take into account multiple testing, which never got a proper description, so we changed it to a standard Bonferroni-corrected p value cutoff computed for 15 counties and 4 ancestries (8.33*10^-4). Given the little difference, we confirm significance status for all tests. - Following up on this, it seems a bit strange to say that one intends to control the pleiotropies that exist between traits by avoiding overly stringent multiple testing corrections as Bonferroni. Without an alternative way to control for multiple testing (e.g. FDR, or looking at genetic correlations between traits), I don't think the best course of action is to err on the side of anti-caution and go with a vanilla P-value cutoff designed for single tests. What does ""significance"" in this context tell one about the importance of different ancestral contributions? Indeed we are using a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR approach to give significance, we now specify it better throughout the text and in the discussion section that was mentioning this problem. This, although not solving the issue of assessing significance for pleiotropic traits, is a widely used method where redundancy/non independence of tests represents a problem (e.g. testing Gene Ontology nested categories) - I commend the authors for adding a city/countryside residency covariate in their model, to control for socio-economic effects. I wouldn't suggest, however, that this covariate allows one to entirely control for other socio-economic effects (for example, socioeconomic or cultural effects that might not be well explained by place of residence). This is a very hard problem and the subject of extensive research (see for example Mostafavi et al. 2020). Maybe add some cautionary statements along these lines? Thank you for understanding our effort in accounting for such complex confounders. We agree and while discussing genome-wide covA associations not replicated in candidate regions, we added that their significance “...might indicate an incomplete correction of non-genetic factors in the genome-wide analysis. Indeed, it is possible that place of residence and educational attainment alone cannot fully account for confounding environmental effects such as socioeconomic status.”",2022-02-08T17:23:53,,Davide Marnetto,10.1101/2021.08.03.454888,Ancestral contributions to contemporary European complex traits,"Davide Marnetto, Vasili Pankratov, Mayukh Mondal, Francesco Montinaro, Katri Pärna, Leonardo Vallini, Ludovica Molinaro, Lehti Saag, Liisa Loog, Sara Montagnese, Rodolfo Costa, Mait Metspalu, Anders Eriksson, Luca Pagani",2021-08-04

Below you can find our answers to the points made in the review Comments We suggest moving part of the model validation section of the results, shown in Figures 8 (and 9), to the start of the manuscript. This rearrangement would show the reader that the mathematical model used in the in silico simulations can accurately reproduce experimental data, before the parameter-dependent changes to NPQ and ՓPSII are simulated. In the current arrangement, the reader needs to have prior knowledge that the changes in NPQ and ՓPSII shown in the simulations are accurate, before the herein updated model has been validated. Answer : This is a good point! We changed the order of the section accordingly. - Fig8. Regarding the validation of the mathematical model by comparing to experimental PAM measurements with different SP durations, or different delays of AL onset from Fm measurement, with the simulated data: what is the rationale for choosing these, how about testing the other parameters such as AL intensity and frequency of SP? Please comment on the impact of the different parameters on e.g. the NPQ measurement and rank them by stronger to lower effect based on your simulations and experiments. Also a historical perspective/physiological relevance of delaying the SP from actinic onset would be welcome! How about giving recommendation to researchers in the field to have Fm determination/SP right at onset of illumination, with no delay, to prevent further confusion (and similarly have the final SP in AL on, followed by AL off with no delay). Answer: We started the project as simulation study and then decided which experiments to perform for underlining our point. We chose the SP durations, or different delays of AL onset from Fm measurement according to two points. 1. We wanted to include a parameter that showed an effect in our simulations and one that didn’t. 2. We also talked with our collaborators, which of the parameters would be easily measured with  their equipment. To rank the parameters by stronger to lower effect based on our simulations and experiments is a good idea! However, which parameter has the biggest impact is research question depended. A final answer can thus not be given. What we can say is that the delay before and after switching on and off the actinic light has the biggest impact in our simulations. It is necessary to give recommendation for future use of PAM devices. However, in this manuscript we decided not to give them, because this needs a previous discussion with multiple researcher working in many fields ( a consortium) - Line 326. Regarding the use of another model of photosynthesis, we found this very interesting and suggest that a comparison of the simulations generated by the two mathematical models using the same set of parameters be included as a main or supplemental figure, and its description be included in the results section. The GitLab link (line 330) doesn’t specify which exact file to look at. Answer: This is a good point! We will create a figure. We will provide a more specific path to the file in the GitLab. - Line 127. “We have used 500 µmol s−1 m−2 as the default light intensity of AL.” For simulations, an intensity of 500 µmol m−2 s−1 was used, but for experiments (line 152) “The intensity of red AL was set at approx. 457 µmol m−2 s−1”. We understand that matching the actinic light during the experiment to 500 µmol m−2s−1 cannot be possible, alternatively we suggest that the simulations be carried out at 457 µmol m−2 s−1 for sake of consistency. Importantly, is 457 µmol m−2 s−1 the value given by the manufacturer for the chosen setting, and did you measure it to confirm its value? (depending on instrument calibration, usage and age, the light output can be different than set) Answer: Thank you for this suggestion we changed the default value in the simulation from 500 to 457  µmol m−2 s−1. We asked our collaborators to check the light intensity. - Line 204, 205. “The calculated steady-state NPQ values are higher for SP intensities below 3000 µmol s−1 m−2”, according to Fig.5, it seems that the threshold is rather 2000, than 3000 (or 4000). Answer: Thank you for your comment we will discuss the exact value again. Our first impression was that it could be actually a little bit lower than the value given in the manuscript. - Fig7. To test the “actinic effect” of SP duration, we would suggest to perform a simulation with AL=100 µmol m−2 s−1 AL and/or AL=0 to check whether SP themselves can induce NPQ. According to Fig8A (experimental), it seems that at 0.8s, NPQ is indeed slightly higher than with shorter SP duration. Answer: We did the simulation and included it in our simulation files. In fact, the simulation showed that only a rather small amount of NPQ is generated with AL=0. - Line 370, a necessary addition would be to list here, or write a template of, what you suggest for minimum information is needed as standard for the community. It could be similar to Table 2, and needs to include duration of AL on, off and AL quality. Answer: Thank you for this suggestion. We discussed about giving a list of standard information. We believe that something like this will be necessary in the future. However, to assemble a useful and complete list a previous broad discussion must be held including experimental and theoretical plant physiologist, working in a broad range of fields. All those fields using PAM can have different views on what is important. Because we are just a small group of scientists, we would not like to create such a list as part of the manuscript. However, we hope to give further impetus to such endeavors Minor comments -Line 46. “Allow”, should be “allows” - Line 75. “Groups but also” should be “groups experimentally, but also” -Line 115. Replace higher by vascular. - Line 140. 26C is higher than standard temperature for Arabidopsis growth (22C), what’s the rationale for choosing this temperature? - Line 150. Define Fv and explain if the 5s of far red light is turned on at the very beginning of the experiment i.e. before time 0. - Line 153. “default settings (10)”, specify “set at value of” 10. We suggest writing a small table with these parameters (see major comment). - Line 161. Which leaf did you choose, younger or older? This information is important to state, see differences with leaf age for example in Bielczynski et al. Plant Phys (2017) doi: 10.1104/pp.17.00904. Answer: Thank you for your comments. We will make the suggested changes. In the experiments far-red light was used for all experiments. We used leaves of approximately the same age the plants were approx. 5 weeks old. We will double check with our experimental collaborators -Line 173-174. We suggest that the SP time points are moved to the methods section. - Line 185-186. “In the upper panel….derived NPQ and ՓPSII”, this whole sentence can be removed as it should be clear from the figure legend. Answer: Thank you for these comments. Line 211. “Far more” how many did you look at? Answer: In the current version of the manuscript we included a literature survey. - Fig. 6. “6A and 6A”. Should be “6A and 6B” - Line 234. “Switching on AL with the first SP in light-triggered after 1 s” suggest rewording as it was unclear what light-triggered means. - Line 241. The observed effect is likely due to the total conversion of zeaxanthin to violaxanthin for long periods of dark-adaptation. - Line 243. Suggest changing “whereas” should be “however” as it is clearer. - Line 256. Define PMST. - Line 264-268. We suggest moving this block of text to the discussion section. - Line 264. “AL is another important information” should be “AL is another important piece of information” Answer: Thank you for these comments we will implement them -Fig. 8B and 8D. As the simulated curves seem to all overlap, and often in this study we look for fine nuances between data, we think it would be beneficial to read the simulated curve superimposed on top of the experimental data allowing a fair comparison and analysis between the two types of data. Displaying the same graphs at a larger scale would help to read them. To help in this, we propose Figure 8 to be divided in two figures, since Fig. 8A-D is related to “SP experiment” while Fig. 8E-H is related to the “delay experiment”. This would allow the size of the panels to be increased to help the reader interpret the data. Answer: Thank you for your suggestion. We will try different setups. -Fig. 8F and 8H. Plot titles “Delay NPQ/ՓPSII Sim lation”, should be “Delay NPQ/ՓPSII Simulation” - Fig. 9 seems to be redundant as the reader should be able to observe the difference between the two independent experiments by comparing Figure 8A and 8E. We therefore suggest that Fig. 9 be removed. - Line 286. “Measurements are” should be “measurements have been” - Line 289-303. We suggest moving this block of text to the introduction section - Line 324. Replace “many” by “all”! - Line 351. “Agreements” should be “agreement” - Line 361-372. We feel that the points made in this block of text have already been made earlier in the manuscript and repeated several times. Therefore this block of text can probably be omitted as it is redundant. Answer: Thank you for the comments we will try to make improvements -General comments concerning the figures: we suggest adding dark/light bars to the top of most plots in Figures 3B-C, 4B-C, 6A-D, 7A-B, 8A-H; as it would improve the readability/interpretation of the plotted data. Fig. 2-8, figure identifier letters are presented in a different font style than the rest of the text, throughout the document. While we recognize them to be hyperlinks, we think font style should be uniform. Answer: Thank you for pointing this out. We will add light bar where applicable and change the font style of identifiers. blockquote { margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm; background: transparent }p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 115%; background: transparent }a:link { color: #000080; so-language: zxx; text-decoration: underline }",2022-02-04T12:11:30,,Tim Nies,10.1101/2021.05.12.443801,Chlorophyll fluorescence: How the quality of information about PAM instrument parameters may affect our research,"Tim Nies, Yuxi Niu, Oliver Ebenhöh, Shizue Matsubara, Anna Matuszyńska",2021-05-13

However, i remain critical on how you can be sure that the nematodes were in suspended form for thousand of years on end or rule out contamination. It is clear that permafrost can be a dynamic environment so not all material sampled from a particular place needs to derive from the time (e.g., mixing is possible).

It is nice to see when the original intent (public reviews) of BiorXiv is met. We acquired our FRAP data with an acquisition interval of 1 second with a frame size 512 x 512 squared pixels. This was done after several rigorous standardization sessions to comparatively measure all 19 different protein LLPS systems under identical FRAP instrumental parameters. During our standardization runs, we had tried with more frequent acquisition intervals (frame rates) and also in continuous mode—both leading to substantial passive bleaching for our LLPS systems—rendering our measurements very difficult to analyze. You are right that for a satisfactory single-exponential fit, more data-points between 0 and 100% recovery (especially near the 50% recovery region) are required. We would like to emphasize that indeed, we do have several points between 0 and 100% recovery (and also in the region around 50% recovery) for all of our samples. Important to note that in our figures (Figure 2b and 3b), we have plotted the FRAP recovery for 19 protein LLPS systems in a single panel. We did not show all the data points in our figure panel simply for the sake of visual clarity. In the figure panels of our manuscript, we have shown data-points for every 4 seconds while the raw data were acquired every 1 second. The t1/2 were calculated from fitting the raw data with a single-exponential model and therefore takes into account all the data points near the 50% recovery region (taken with 1 second interval). Only for α-Syn LLPS, we have only one data point around 80% recovery after which the system recovers fully. By fitting this data with a standard single-exponential model, we have obtained a t1/2, which is very close to the reported value of t1/2 for α-Syn LLPS that we have previously published; where we do have several data-points near the 50% recovery zone. However, after your comments, we will surely perform FRAP of α-Syn droplets with a more frequent acquisition interval. We would like to thank you for pointing this out. Please also note that we have not calculated the t1/2 values in Figure 5g. The data only emphasizes on the high recovery of fluorescence indicating the liquid-like nature of the droplets formed by homo-polypeptides.",2022-01-29T07:32:46,disqus_8I6X6MC9uJ,Komal Patel,10.1101/2021.12.31.474648,Liquid condensate is a common state of proteins and polypeptides at the regime of high intermolecular interactions,"Manisha Poudyal, Komal Patel, Ajay Singh Sawner, Laxmikant Gadhe, Pradeep Kadu, Debalina Datta, Semanti Mukherjee, Soumik Ray, Ambuja Navalkar, Siddhartha Maiti, Debdeep Chatterjee, Riya Bera, Nitisha Gahlot, Ranjith Padinhateeri, Samir K.

As part of our review of pre-prints, we compile comments from our discussion that we think may better your publication. Overall, our group found the manuscript to be a very interesting read with detailed information on the structure/function of SteD emerging. We can tell that considerable thought that went into each experiment as well as figure production. Your lab has shown an exceptional amount of rigor in your experimental designs that made it difficult to refute your findings. This study was very well done, and we all enjoyed discussing it. Below we point out some comments and aspects that we feel could improve on the manuscript. 1)	We felt that the text was a little difficult to follow. Though it is probable that this will be alleviated once the paper has been properly formatted, as the figures help a great deal in understanding the text. 2)	We very much appreciated the short anecdotes in the manuscript explaining the specific actions of the chemicals used for your experiments. None in our journal club work this closely with transport systems and it made understanding your work much easier. 3)	We were curious about your justification for using a melanoma cell line in your studies rather than an APC line like BMDMs? We’ve noticed that it has been used for other Salmonella studies, but we think it necessary that you justify in the text why you use this cell line. 4)	The order of your figures is a little confusing, specifically figures 1-3. We think it would really help if you were to either combine Figures 1 and 3 in some manner or reorder them so that Figure 3 comes just after Figure 1, rather than being interrupted by Figure 2. This would streamline the reading and comprehension of your data greatly. 5)	On the topic of Figure 3, we were curious as to why you found the specificities you did and yet continued to use the region 13 mutation rather than the S68A G69A mutations in your experiments for Figure 4. Especially given the problems you had with region 13 mutation expression and release from Salmonella. 6)	Our group wanted to extend our compliments to your inclusion of the protein diagrams you had throughout your paper. The visualization made it easy to understand the mutations made and really helped with the overall comprehension of the paper and the experiments you were completing. On this note, however, we don’t think it necessary to highlight the F and Y residues in Figure 7. They are discussed in the text but are not tested in the figure. That depiction would be better included in a supplemental figure showing the experimental results from those mutations. 7)	Lastly, we believe Figure 5C should be moved to supplementary since it only confirms that your siRNA worked as intended.

Overall, we enjoyed this manuscript discussing the multi-kingdom interactions of bacteria, fungi and amoebae, and their implications for the evolution of pathogenicity and endosymbiosis in natural environments. We thought the impact of the bacterial endosymbiosis on the fungal interactions with other eukaryotes was very cool, the experiments were well controlled, and the phenomenon was well documented. Major comments and suggestions: The claims made in the title are considerably broader than what was shown in the data, specifically the idea that the amoebae are ""drivers"" of both endosymbiosis and pathogenicity. While the impacts of the endosymbiosis on Dicty are very nicely shown, an important part that is missing is: what are the impacts of Dicty on the fungi/bacteria, either alone or during symbiosis? How do amoebae alter their endosymbiosis or pathogenicity? There is no demonstrated selection by the amoebae on either of these traits, both of which are important pieces to make this ""driver"" claim. Relatedly, given that the endosymbiosis generally increases fungal spore resistance to multiple environmental stressors (Fig. 6C), it could easily be that abiotic stressors are 'driving' some of these phenotypes in natural microbial populations. Possible ways to improve this gap include: - mixing different ratios of symbiotic and aposymbiotic fungi and placing these under an amoeba predation regime. Do the symbiotic fungi end up with a larger population size? In the mixed cultures, are aposymbiotic fungi preferentially eaten? - An experimental evolution study in which aposymbiotic fungi are incubated with extracellular symbionts +/- amoeba predation. Does amoeba predation select for re-initiation of the symbiosis? - Adding selective pressures from a couple of different amoeba species in this experiment, as it might vary considerably across amoebae - Rephrasing the title to remove the evolutionary 'driver' framing. Minor comments: - The figure labeling and figure legends could be clarified in Figures 3, 4, and 8, - In Fig. 4F, why was such a small percentage of the R. pickettii conditioned medium added? You showed earlier in this figure that it takes a relatively large % of conditioned medium to see an effect. - In Fig. 6E-H, given that the cell wall composition looks different by TEM in D, we recommend performing these staining experiments in parallel in symbiotic and aposymbiotic strains to get a hint of how the cell wall has changed. - Fig 8 B seems to show similar data (but with less information) than Fig 8A. Can you include 8A only, with an 8A-like graph for the swollen spores as well (currently 8C)?",2022-01-27T16:41:35,teralevin,Tera Levin,10.1101/584607,Environmental interactions with amoebae as drivers of bacterial-fungal endosymbiosis and pathogenicity,"Herbert Itabangi, Poppy C.

I am not going to respond to everything right now, but I want you to know that this feedback has been seen and will be included when we make our next round of revisions. We are currently working on another iteration of this analysis that tries to answer a specific clinical question. We have metagenomes from a large cohort of pregnant people that have high exposure to three antibiotics of different drug classes.  For one of the conditions in our cohort is BV or bacterial Vaginosis - it is recurring so antibiotics often do not completely resolve the condition. We are interested in understanding AMR plays a role in this recurrance, but since we are interested in AMR to only a few drugs, we need to carefully select the tool for detecting the AMR genes in this cohort. We are going to basically repeat the methods (integrating your point in #2) to try to select the tool that can ""best"" detect the resistance for these three drugs in this cohort. I hope that makes it clearer! Again, thank you for taking the time to provide this feedback. These are all good points for improving the science.

You should check that. This is probably a signal picked up by tour neural network. Another reason could be your fixation and rehydration protocol that increases the ambient noise. - Yes, it is unexpected high. It is unlikely to be sequencing artefacts, as the spacer sequences are very different from each other in the libraries -- we tried to avoid mis-targeting effects of CRISPRi when designing these libraries. We hypothesize that the enrichment procedure of guide sequences exposes the ambient sgRNAs, this may explain why there are fewer ambient mRNAs comparing to sgRNAs. We also observed the presence of strong ambient signals in other datasets from other labs, please see supplementary Fig. 2. Together, we think this may be a systematic issue of single cell omics rather than specific experimental problem (e.g. impropriate infection). This is what scAR aim to solve. I like your idea of fixation and rehydration protocol. The preparation of single cell suspension definitely should have an impact on ambient noise. We briefly discuss this in the last paragraph in discussion section. - with a multiplicity of infection of 0.3, you do expect ~25% of the cells to have >2 guides. If you find less there is a problem. However your expression vs guide assignment argument is convincing for the accuracy of scAR so it might be worth checking the expression of the candidate second guide targets. - There should be a small fraction of multi-infection. The output of scAR is a matrix of Bayesian factors, one can set a global threshold on it to assign the guides, which should be able to distinguish single infection and multi-infection. As mentioned in the manuscript, the purpose here is to demonstrate the accuracy of scAR, so we do not use any arbitrary thresholds on either naive assignment and scAR. For a specific study, we would recommend to set a reasonable threshold on the output of scAR, although we will provide a default threshold for simplicity. We will demonstrate these in a tutorial.

We have begun doing preprint manuscript reviews during our “journal clubs” as a way to enhance our engagement with current literature and to hopefully assist with the manuscript if possible! Our lab also studies the behaviors of biomolecular liquid-solid transitions – with a focus on protein structure. We selected this manuscript out of curiosity for the spatial origins of solidification in liquid-liquid phase separated systems. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is central to the spatiotemporal organization of biomolecules in the cell. Many of the proteins that are thought to mediate LLPS have also been found in pathological aggregates and fibrils that are associated with neurodegenerative disease. It has been demonstrated that liquid-like phase separated bodies can adopt gel-like or solid morphologies over time, which suggests that LLPS droplets may serve as nucleation points for pathological aggregates. This manuscript interrogates this process by characterizing the spatial characteristics of the liquid-to-solid transition within individual alpha-synuclein condensates using a set of fluorescence and infrared microscopy techniques. The authors found that droplets solidify form a central focal point that can be imaged through associated changes in fluorescence lifetime (via fluorescence lifetime imaging, FLIM) and protein secondary structure (via Fourier transform infra-red microscopy, FTIRM). To emphasize this significance in the text, we think it may be helpful if the authors added more background and discussion of previous literature on the spatial origin of solidification. These findings are exciting as they add new insight into biomolecular liquid-to-solid transitions, and relevant due to the potential role for liquid-to-solid transitions in neurodegenerative disease. We find that the combination of fluorescence microscopy techniques used here presents a strong model for studying spatiotemporal material properties of biomolecular condensates, which are challenging to characterize from a structural perspective due to their inherent heterogeneity and sensitivity to environmental factors. The power of these techniques is shown in their ability to complement the FLIM data into protein mobility (FRAP), structure (FTIRM), and interaction (FRET) components, providing a comprehensive look into the liquid-to-solid transition. We appreciated the use of small fluorophores rather than fluorescent proteins, as well as the confirmation by fluorophore-free techniques (TEM & cryo-SEM). Overall, we find that the data and the resulting model for the spatiotemporal dynamics of the liquid-solid transition are compelling. One area we are curious about is the sample handling, keeping a sample hydrated for 20 days is difficult. Would you be able to add a few words about the robustness of this moisture chamber in the main text? These aspects of the experimental design might not be obvious to a reader unfamiliar with the practical considerations of experiments like this, so more discussion would be helpful to anyone trying to reproduce the experiments. In a similar vein, a paragraph about the practical aspects of FLIM in the context of LLPS would be helpful. We also wondered about the necessity of the solidification timeline, how would the microscopy procedures described here work for a system that progresses to solid much faster than 20 days? What are the time limitations of these techniques? Would a faster system be expected to have the same center-growth effect as seen here? We were surprised that droplets appear to solidify from the exact center of the droplet in every case. If the model for solidification is that it begins from a (random) nucleation point, then why would droplet solidification always begin exactly in the center, as opposed to the inner or outer center regions that are mapped in Figure 1. We were left wanting more information about this, especially since FLIM is capable of resolving changes on these scales. It would be interesting to see if there are any cases where solidification does not begin from the exact center of the droplet. Some minor comments: -While the figures are clear and well-organized, a more colorblind-friendly palette could be used. -Infrared is occasionally hyphenated throughout the text. -The abstract figure may be clarified if the FLIM images were all of a single droplet, matching the cartoon. -The schematics describing the planes on the droplet are beautifully done and very helpful to understanding the figures. -Figure 1: formatting error with (e) placement. -Figure 2: (c) As we are unfamiliar with FTIRM, we thought it may be useful to have the corresponding secondary structure to each wavenumber (like the supplementary table 1 information) in the figure. Similarly, while supplementary figure 7 has a monomer and fibril control, we would have enjoyed that in the main figure. -Figure 4: (c) We wonder how consistent these recoveries are for several different droplets at the same time point. -For the TEM data (Fig 5), the results are a little bit different from other attempts to perform TEM on LLPS systems (for example, here: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.... A discussion of precedent would be appreciated in the main text. -Supplementary Fig. 11: We thought these EM images were fascinating and are curious if such images exist elsewhere for biomolecular condensates. ---------------------------------------------- We appreciated the chance to read and review this manuscript, The Debelouchina Lab",2022-01-21T22:03:41,,Debelouchina Lab,10.1101/2021.10.20.465113,Spatiotemporal solidification of α-synuclein inside the liquid droplets,"Soumik Ray, Debdeep Chatterjee, Semanti Mukherjee, Komal Patel, Jaladhar Mahato, Sangram Kadam, Rakesh Krishnan, Ajay Singh Sawner, Manisha Poudyal, G Krishnamoorthy, Arindam Chowdhury, Ranjith Padinhateeri, Samir K.

You should check that. This is probably a signal picked up by tour neural network. Another reason could be your fixation and rehydration protocol that increases the ambient noise. - with a multiplicity of infection of 0.3, you do expect ~25% of the cells to have >2 guides. If you find less there is a problem.

Indeed, we had to face some hard decisions while discussing the protocol. I think that 10cm is not enough for some soils. However, we have to stick to a single and unambiguous standard. The 10cm is chosen because of compatibility: this depth is used to assess microbial communities and soil functions/parameters by the core Soil BON network AND this depth is used to assess micro- and msofauna by us. This way, the data will be better and quantitatively connected. Besides, we have to reduce efforts per site to make the global assessment feasible. Having 20 or 30 cm for macrofauna sorting is considerably more work (tricky for many teams and for transportation of soil if necessary), but less compatibility and not always much additional information.

Instead of starting from the supplementary data formatted for the paper, I went back to the computer cluster and re-downloaded the raw data.

Neither is the valid gene name ""CD630_23640"". Given that ""CD630_02364"" isn't in any of my data I don't have an explanation for how that made it into this paper draft.

Unlike the intensively studied transfer of small regulatory RNA and fragmented RNA by extracellular vesicles, relatively little is known about full-length mRNA transfer between adjacent cells via direct cell-to-cell tunneling nanotubes (TNTs).  Dasgupta et al provide a comprehensive set of the high depth bulk RNA-sequencing experiments and downstream bioinformatics analysis to determine overall levels of the most abundantly transferred RNA. They show that RNA transfer to the acceptor mouse cells is non-selective and the amount of transferred RNA strongly correlates with the endogenous level of gene expression in the donor human cells. They validate these results using a variety of orthogonal approaches (e.g. qRT-PCR, smFISH together with advanced imaging techniques, spatially separated cell culture) that overall support: 1) The relatively low level of endogenous mRNAs and lncRNAs transfer via TNTs. 2) TNTs as the predominant route for transcriptome-wide mRNA transfer. In addition, both cis-RNA motif-enrichment analysis and synthetic RNA reporter assays in cell culture back-up the authors’ conclusions on non-selective RNA transfer via TNTs. Lastly, the authors observed stark changes in the acceptor mouse cell transcriptome in response to co-culture with the donor human cancer cells, including the upregulation of cancer-associated genes as result of oncogenic-like transformation.  This is a carefully performed study based on a simple and quantitative method. Overall the conclusions are well justified and supported, limitations of the study are clearly stated. The only minor comments and suggestions that I have are: 1.  The authors performed polyA(+) RNA-sequencing. How abundant could be the 3’ end partially decayed mRNA transferred to the acceptor cells? 2. The direct correlation between RNA and protein levels in MCF7 is shown previously in (Edfors et al 2016). Is it known that the TNT-transferred MCF7 mRNAs undergo translation in the acceptor mouse cells? 3. TNTs are also shown to transfer proteins. Is there any overlap between the TNT-transferred mRNA and proteins? The points 2-3 are very challenging to address but could be discussed. 4. Fig 3C. Is mRNA half-life in K562 consistent with the mRNA half-life rates in MCF7? 5. I find the ability of the transferred RNA to down-regulate cell immunity-related genes interesting. Could this be an indirect effect? The authors used unique mapped reads in downstream bioinformatics analysis. Is there any estimation of the multi-mapped reads in the TNT-transferred RNA fraction?",2022-01-17T19:43:52,innabiryukova,innabiryukova,10.1101/2021.11.28.470233,Global analysis of human-to-mouse intercellular RNA transfer in cell culture,"Sandipan Dasgupta, Daniella Y.

But I am more doubtful about the methodology. I have 3 main comments. First, it would be useful to provide the AMR genes detected in the assembled genomes of the selected isolates. If only the reads are available, assemble them with SPADES. Do the search with the differents tools and combine detections which match at the same locus. This will helps the reader to know what exactly is expected from the artificial mock metagenome. For instance, I can't believe that fARGene finds 713 distinct genes after condensation, and even the 33 genes for RGI is suspicious. Comparing detections from the mock with the expected number from assembled genomes will provide some new useful metrics. This will help to provide more details on what is detected/not detected (which genes) and why. Related to the reference database/models ? To the defaults matching parameters ? Other ? Second, the way the mock community is constructed is inadequate. Metagenomic data reflect complex microbial communities (of hundreds of taxa) for which a small minority are AMR pathogens. Putting 9 highly multi-resistant pathogens together at equal proportion is not consistent with real metagenomes. In this regard, reducing the coverage from 100x to 50x and 5x doesn't help because AMR genes represent the exact same relative abundance in terms of reads in the 3 datasets. I would suggest to get a bunch of other isolate's sequences, from sensitive bacteria and include them in excess to simulate the whole bacterial community. The proportion of pathogens could then be modulated (e.g. 1/50, 1/100, 1/1000) to simulate the various conditions (healthy / infected patients). Last and more scientifically speaking, I don't really get for which kind of purpose the AMR gene detection will be used, and how the connection with phenotypic resistance will be treated (inference ?). The manuscript refers several times to clinical diagnosis use of metagenomic data, but I don't understand how. For instance, several E. coli strains concurrently exist in the gut, so detecting a bla-TEM gene in the metagenome will not help to infer which E. coli is resistant. And it may actually not be a E. coli at all since most AMR genes can be found in different species. I hope these few comments will help to improve this work, I don't have time to proceed to a full review.
