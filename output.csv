Review synthesized by Bianca Melo Trovò. This study demonstrates the utility of an L-Methionine analog - ProSeMet - to tag and enrich proteins which have residues that are methylated in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that this can be used in combination with mass spectrometry to identify these sites. Overall this is a useful, well-verified and well-described approach that will be helpful for future identification and investigation of methylation sites. Major comments It would be helpful if the manuscript could additionally discuss the reversibility of methylation generally, and the reversibility of the modification of protein residues by the alkyne group specifically, in the discussion, and whether that has any implications for their results. It may be that the dynamics of methylation and demethylation vary between the two; or it may be that they are the same - either way, that may affect how they suggest others use this method and interpret its results. Perhaps related to the question of reversibility, it would be helpful if the manuscript would comment on whether these are “true” methylation sites or not; i.e. whether they consider all these methylation sites to be functional. Trying to determine this would be an interesting direction for future work, but for this study a reflection on whether these novel functional methylation sites are simply capable of being methylated, or are likely to be methylation sites that are meaningful biologically, would be helpful. Results, ProSeMet competes with L-Met to pseudo methylate protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus: the manuscript claims that ProSeMet is not incorporated into newly synthesized proteins but rather converted to ProSeAM and used by native methyltransferases. There does appear to be some reduction in the labeling with ProSeMet on cycloheximide treatment  in Figure 2D - could this suggest that it is incorporated into newly synthesized proteins as well as being converted to ProSeAM? If not, could the manuscript explain why not? This experiment clearly shows that in contrast to AHA labeling, there is still use of ProSeMet as a substrate when translation is inhibited; however, it is not clear how this demonstrates that it is not incorporated at all into newly synthesized proteins. If methyl has been incorporated in previously present proteins, perhaps this can be clarified in the text. Results, ProSeMet competes with L-Met to pseudomethylate protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus: the conclusion that “ Cell fractionation of the cytosolic and nuclear compartments followed by SDS-PAGE fluorescent analysis revealed no fluorescent labeling of the L-Met control ” is correct but may be overstated as there appears to be some background in the cytosolic fraction. Minor comments Introduction: Recommend including a mention to ProSeMet's permeability.

Results, Fig. 2A ‘ incubating for 30 m in L-Met free media’ : Please confirm that the length of incubation was 30 minutes. Results, Enrichment of pseudo methylated proteins used to determine breadth of methyl proteome: Please provide some description for the SMARB1-deficient G401 cell line. Why smarb1 deficient? Results, Figure 3: Please define BP, MF, HP, NES, and label the x and y axes in panel D. Results, ProSeMet-directed pseudo methylation is detectable in vivo: Please, clarify if the administration was oral. Comments on reporting Results, ProSeMet competes with L-Met to pseudo methylate protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus: Please verify the quantity reported: 5µg on SDS-PAGE gel seems low. Results, ProSeMet-directed pseudo methylation is detectable in vivo: the manuscript reports that “mice starved prior to ProSeMet injection had increased ProSeMet labeling in the heart, whereas mice fed prior to ProSeMet administration had increased labeling in the brain and lungs”. The error bars are large, it would be helpful to show the individual real data points for the graphs in Figure 4.

The comments were synthesized by Vasanthanarayan Murugesan. In this preprint, Hughes et al. describe the interaction between the ER protein PERK and the mitochondrial protein ATAD3A. During ER stress, PERK phosphorylates elF2a leading to reduced global protein synthesis. The authors show that increased interaction between PERK and ATAD3A during such stress attenuates elF2a phosphorylation locally around mitochondria, resulting in continued translation of mitochondrial protein despite a reduction in global protein translation. The authors present multiple lines of evidence to support this claim and the experiments were well performed. The findings may have important implications for the understanding of mitochondrial protein synthesis and the interactions between mitochondria and the ER. The following suggestions were raised: Experiments The manuscript would benefit greatly by measuring protein translation explicitly showing that mitochondrial protein translation is retained despite a reduction in global protein synthesis under certain conditions. That would help determine whether mitochondrial protein translation is protected under certain conditions driven by ATAD3 expression. The specificity of ATAD3A towards PERK activation requires further experimental validation. Some specific suggestions are: - Changes in activation of other pEIF2a kinases, such as GCN2 or PKR, could be measured to discard their involvement. - In Figure S2, protein levels of ATF6 should accompany changes in spliced XBP1. - ATF4 levels, a downstream marker of the signaling pathway, could be measured. Manuscript Recommend providing more details about the experimental protocol when treating cells with ER stressors. Different treatment durations are found throughout the manuscript (30min, 1h, 8h…). More information would be helpful in understanding the election of those time points for different experiments. In Figure 2, recommend including the blots for the downstream targets ATF4, GADD34 and CHOP at the 30 minutes time point, where the upstream activation starts. In Figure 2, the differences shown in the representative images for p-eIF2a and ATF4 appear milder than what is shown in the graph. In particular when compared with the interpretation of blots in Fig. S2. It is suggested to include all the blots used for quantification in Figure 2 in a supplemental figure so it can be clear how overexpressing/downregulating ATAD3A has a meaningful effect on this signaling pathway. Figure 2B shows 5 different (phospho)proteins using the same loading control blot. This approach would require stripping of the membrane after each blotting, can this be specified in figure legends and in the Materials & Methods. Was the membrane stripped after each blot or were different membranes used? If different membranes were used, please indicate so and present the individual beta-actin blots corresponding to each protein as a supplemental figure. In Figure 3A, arrows indicating the contact sites between ER and the mitochondria would be helpful in highlighting the colocalization of the two proteins. Please also provide scale bars for the images. In Figure 3D, the #contacts per mitochondria, it is important to specify the area of images analyzed. It is unclear that n=45 images from 3 separate experiments refers to 45 images per experiment or a total of 45 images pooled from 3 experiments. Please clarify.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.11.503542v1#comment-5960826580,biorxivstage,0,"We were extremely interested to see these impressive structures of a chimeric Sec translocon, held in a state ready for post-translational translocation through interaction with Sec62/63, bound to eight different inhibitors. Particularly noteworthy to us is that the inhibitor mycolactone binds in a different location in this study when compared with our previous structure of the same inhibitor bound to a ribosome-bound translocon, primed for co-translational translocation (Gerard et al Molecular Cell 79 406-15). The authors speculate that “Our data suggest that the density feature previously assigned as mycolactone is unlikely to be mycolactone.” While it is true that our previous structure has a resolution of ~5A in the region of the map attributed to mycolactone, and therefore also true that we cannot unambiguously place mycolactone in this density, we remain confident that this density is mycolactone for the following reasons: (i)	Our procedure involved incubation of microsomes with mycolactone at a concentration of ~0.3µM (compared with 100µM used by Itskanov) before detergent/digitonin treatment and purification of ribosome-associated Sec complexes. A similar sample was prepared without mycolactone. When these two protein complexes were studied by cryo-electron microscopy, the Sec translocon adopted a substantially different conformation when mycolactone-bound compared with free. The only difference between these two samples was the presence of mycolactone, indicating that this structural difference is due to mycolactone binding. (ii)	We confirmed the presence of mycolactone in our mycolactone-bound purified using mass spectrometry of a sample taken immediately before addition to grids for structural analysis. (iii)	Analysis of the electron density for the mycolactone-bound translocon did not reveal any density feature in the mycolactone-bound sample in the location of the binding site observed by Itskanov. Therefore ribosome-bound, mycolactone-bound translocon is different from Sec62/63-bound, mycolactone-bound translocon. (iv)	The only additional density feature observed in the ribosome-bound, mycolactone-bound translocon is that which we have attributed to mycolactone and molecular dynamics simulations confirm that mycolactone is stable in this binding site. It is therefore our view that we did not misattribute the electron density into which we have placed mycolactone. Instead, it is our view that the difference between these two structures is likely to be genuine and mechanistically interesting. There are possible technical differences which could account for the different binding sites observed when comparing our structure with that of Itskanov: •	While we added mycolactone to the Sec translocon while still in the native membrane environment of microsomes, and then extracted the mycolactone-bound complex, Itskanov added to mycolactone to translocon after its purification and integration into  a non-lipid peptidisc. Our model for how mycolactone reaches its binding site in our system relies on translocon “breathing” within the physiological situation of a lipid bilayer, and mycolactone itself being present in this bilayer. It is not known if the translocon within a peptidisc is able to undertake similar “breathing”, nor how highly hydrophobic mycolactone may interact with this material. •	While we used native canine microsomes, Itzkanov et al used a hybrid translocon, comprised of human transmembrane regions and yeast extracellular regions. It is not known if this hybrid translocon is functional for translocation, or whether the translocation of model substrates by it is inhibited by mycolactone. •	There is also a large difference in mycolactone concentration used in the different studies. Mycolactone is effective at sub-nM concentrations on live cells. To provide sufficient molar ratios of mycolactone in concentrated microsomes, we used ~300nM in our studies, while Itskanov used the much higher concentration of 100µM mycolactone. It would be interesting to know whether this was the minimal concentration required for them to see binding, indicating a lower affinity binding site, or was simply the concentration selected. While there are technical differences which might account for the different binding sites observed, there is also the far more interesting possibility that both studies have correctly identified binding sites for mycolactone and that this inhibitor acts differently in post-translational and co-translational translocation. The Sec translocon can act through either a post-translational (involving Sec62/63) or a co-translational (involving ribosomes) mechanism. McKenna, Simmonds and High have previously shown (PMID 26869228) that mycolactone-mediated blockade is different in these two systems. While mycolactone shows a broad effect, preventing co-translational translocation of a wide range of substrates, it has a more restricted effect during post-translational translocation, only affecting translocation of a subset of substrates. Together with the differences in mycolactone binding between these two structures, this suggests the intriguing possibility mycolactone might have two different binding sites; perhaps one site which occurs during co-translational translocation where mycolactone is stably wedged into the cytosolic side of the lateral gate (Gerard et al), and one site which operates in post-translational translocation and is more easily overcome by signal peptide binding (Itskanov et al). Future studies will be required to test this intriguing possibility.

Such a value is almost certainly too low for a large nonavian theropod, being in the area of some of the lowest density flying birds and derived pterosaurs as detailed and/or estimated in Larramendi et al. (2021, Paul 2022). Having less extensive air-sac complexes, including reduced forelimbs, images of swimming large ratites indicate their neutral (midbreath) SGs approach 0.95. Lacking pneumatic limb elements, large theropod dinosaurs should have been even denser. Spinosaurus was less pneumatic than most giant theropods, but more so than typical large land mammals which have NSGs just below 1.0 – most swimming nonaquatic mammals keep their heads sufficiently above water partly by the upwards thrust of active swimming and are at risk of drowning if they become too tired. Estimating the NSG of atypical Spinosaurus is difficult, but it would have been significantly higher than that of ratites and perhaps a little below that typical of terrestrial mammals. Highly aquatic animals that use fairly conventional tetrapod limbs and/or sculling tails for swimming tend to be as dense as or denser than water, with some able to bottom walk including capybaras and hippos, the latter being too dense to surface swim and thus sporting a specific gravity of perhaps 1.1 (Larramendi et al. 2021). Highly aquatic crocodilians are in the area of 1.0. Flightless marine penguins are moderately pneumatic and buoyant. After using their highly hydrodynamically modified and powerful flippers to propel themselves to sometimes considerable depths, the buoyancy helps penguins return to the surface at a pace that minimizes both risk of the bends and energy expenditures when oxygen reserves are depleted (Sato et al. 2002). Those extreme circumstances do not apply to Spinosaurus. and its being pneumatic enough to be a little less dense than water also does not fit the standard adaptations for flipperless tetrapods that pursue prey underwater in shallows as crocodilians sometimes do. Nor does the large rigid, high drag sail. And the deep tail with its very tail slender neural spines assigned to the taxon is more similar to the display structures of nonaquatic basilisks than large bodied tail scullers (Sereno et al.). This paleoartist remains skeptical of Spinosaurus restorations with very reduced hindlimbs, that not yet being verified by any sufficiently complete, well-articulated spinosaur specimens that meet the paleoreconstruction criteria needed to verify a configuration that is so extraordinary for a theropod dinosaur.

I enjoyed reading it and I have a couple of questions/points of feedback that I would like to share. 1. Do I understand correctly that in lines 133-134 the authors state that higher percentages of read recruitment to donor MAGs suggest bacterial colonisation? This seems to me very indirect evidence and not a justifiable conclusion based on this observation alone. 2. In figure 1, Canada is shown slightly bigger than the other countries. Is this because the donors and patients from the current study are also from Canada? I could not find this information in the text. Furthermore, I like that the authors made a distinction between industrialised and less industrialised countries. Would it be possible to change the colours slightly (e.g. make the red magenta) to make it easier for colour blind people to see? Also, the blue and purple rows are somewhat difficult to distinguish for me. Is this intentional, as the donor and post-FMT recipient microbiota are supposed to be similar? 3. I find it interesting that the authors found that only 16 and 44% of donor microbial genomes were detected in all donor metagenomes, suggesting that only a minority of bacteria is stably present over longer periods. (Lines 180-182.) Have the authors considered doing similar analyses on these genomes to find if they are HMI and LMI bacteria? 4. I find the comparison made between short-read taxonomy and donor population detection (lines 184-188) a little difficult to follow. Would it be possible to rephrase this part or add a little explanation of what exactly is compared? 5. Lines 190-194 are also fascinating! Even with such small numbers, it is striking to see that more bacteria colonise from pills that from colonoscopic transfer. Could the authors speculate or provide additional info on why this may be the case? 6. From the final conclusion (lines 431-435) I gather that FMT or similar microbiota therapeutics are unlikely to (temporarily?) cure IBD. Do the authors have suggestions as to what might work better, and would they like to share their perspectives on promising new treatment options? 7. And finally, what do the ellipses in supplementary figures 2 and 3 represent? I suppose they show some sort of area around each cluster centroid. A few extra words of explanation in the figure captions would be nice. This information is also not easily found in the analysis scripts.

Accumulation of changes of several important amino acid residues causes those of ligand-binding specificity of odorant receptor. However, on the basis of your study, it might not be true.

There are three primary interrelated contributions: -Assigning “responsibility” for different regions of the map to a model and then fitting GMM as a real space B-factor. This is a new way to model atomic B-factors, since it is done in real space, compared to reciprocal space in most other software. -Sampling an ensemble based on those B-factors. The major success of this paper was that the authors created a new ensemble method that samples within the B-factors to improve the fit of hundreds of cyro-EM maps, demonstrating that their method is robust and can be done in a high throughput manner. -Refinement procedures for composite maps based on smoothing of responsibility. The examples all seem to be from individual maps with different levels of resolution across the map, not from true composite maps (calculated from different masking procedures for example). This part was very confusing for us to follow and although there are methodological links to the B-factor assignment/ensemble modeling parts of the paper, it might be better explained in a separate manuscript. Major comments: 1. The introduction only briefly discusses B-factors and doesn’t lay out what is distinct about this method. For a contrast, sampling is discussed with references and contrast: “ The sampling itself is usually based on either molecular dynamics (MD)4,9, minimisation10, normal mode analysis and/or gradient following techniques11,12, or Fourier-space based methods2.” Similarly, B-factor refinement should be discussed. The way Phenix and Refmac handle it (real vs. reciprocal space), the limitations that the GMM addresses, etc. 2. With regard to sampling, there are other methods that are now similar for generating ensembles (the EMMI work from Vendruscolo and Bonomi for example). It would be useful to contrast the limitations of those methods and how this method is distinct. For example, this method seems likely to be much more computationally simple to run. It would also be good to benchmark against examples of those ensemble methods in terms of RMSF/inferred B-factors. 3. When you refer to the TEMPy-REFF models in each case study are they always ensemble models using segmentation? 4. How are the weights for each focus map decided for when creating a composite map? Stated in ‘combining focused maps into a single overall composite map, with optimal weights of the focused maps.’ (page 3) We think that more information on how you are generating ensembles belongs in the results section which will help clarify the paper. Some additional specifics we think would make this section strong include: Are the ensembles being created for different segments of the model (based on map segmentation) or the entire model? When creating an ensemble, what is the input model? Has it already gone through iterations of the map to model fitting? How are ensemble models represented? Please provide examples and discuss how you would like these models interpreted. 5. Please clarify how b-factors are represented in your ensemble models and input into maps. Furthermore, in the discussion you state ‘We address this challenge using B-factor estimation. We find, as previously shown by us and others, that an ensemble of equally-well fitted models represents this local variability better than a single model.’ (page 16). However, it is unclear how the b-factors integrate with the ensemble model to represent local resolution. Please clarify which part of your model correlates with local resolution. 6. On average, how many models were included in an ensemble? Please provide a graph of CCC values versus number of models in an ensemble for more examples (ie more than SI Figure 7). How are you thinking about the trade-off between a more complex model versus a small gain in CCC? How deterministic is this procedure? Can you repeat and compare at least one dataset? If you generate multiple ensembles starting from the same structure - do you get the same number of models out and are they similar? 7. If we understand the calculations correctly, the increase in CCC comes from those models being refined independently, not collectively (which makes the increase all the more impressive). Does this suggest the ensemble captures both precision and accuracy (as discussed here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... and therefore the sampling allows escaping of local minima in a clever way. Are there other examples like the His alternative conformation that can help speak to this? 8. When assigning responsibility for a part of the map that may be able to similarly explain two parts of the model, how does the method decide which part of the model should fit in that segment of the map? Please provide more insight on the interpretation of uncertainty of discrete positions of different sidechains as described in the sentence ‘ensemble adopting either (bottom inset), or uncertainty in the exact side chain confirmation (bottom inset) of two residues (Y76 and L78)’. How is uncertainty measured? Is the RMSF similar or comparable to what would be inferred by B-factors? Please compare the numbers you are reporting to other traditional refinement softwares such as REFMAC and Phenix. It’s unclear whether this is capturing anharmonic motions in a really different way or just sampling the B-factor harmonic component. Minor comments: 1. In Figure 1a, please provide more description about what you are representing with the blue and orange circles in the responsibility estimation. 2. How does your method represent very high resolution structures with low b-factors but high numbers of alternative conformers (specifically looking at PDBs: 7A4M, 7A5V of Apoferritin and GABA receptor). 3. In Figure 5a, please clarify how you are normalizing the B-factor. 4. Please deposit output models in Zonodo or some other public repository. 5. What does SMOCf stand for?

I hope this will be done more in the future with other initiatives as well. Though, I personally do have several queries with respect to the SciCV effectiveness and this preprint. With respect to the academic age, in addition to the time take off for parental leave etc. another omission in the manuscript is that in some labs / countries it's common to not publish during their PhD and some labs / countries where it's mandatory to publish to pass their viva which is not taken into account in the academic age. In addition to this, the academic age does not take into account that some students might publish during their BSc or MSc or are included as co-authors on papers during their BSc or MSc. All of these affects the academic age metric without affecting the applicants ability or suitability to be awarded funding. The academic age also does not take into account any time spent in institutions where bullying and harassment has occurred affecting someone's productivity and I would argue this could effectively decrease someone's academic age. In addition the academic age metric could be misused by students and delaying their PhD publications to the last year of their PhD to decrease their academic age and make it come across as if they've got more potential compared to PhD students who didn't do this or weren't advised to do so. So to me the academic age just appears to be another metric that does not (accurately) reflect the applicants capabilities or even career stage. One of my main concerns with respect to the narrative CV and another query with respect to the preprint is related to the section in 'Interviews' on the narratives. (1) ""The interviews indicate that applicants disliked the amount of time needed to author narratives"". Based on my own personal experience (the narrative CV for an EPSRC grant caused major anxiety and was the single task that prevented me from submitting the grant proposal) I suspect that potential applicants with anxiety, caring responsibility, dyslexia, etc. will struggle a lot more with completing this task and as it did in my case prevent them from submitting their grant proposal. So did the authors attempt to investigate this, what is the authors opinion on this? Would including people that were not able to submit grant applications in the interviews and survey change the conclusion that the ""SciCV was a relevant and successful initiative""? (2) ""redundancy and the use of boastful language in narratives were also criticised by some reviewers."" To me this comes across as if the narrative CV will benefit those most with the best support or understanding how to 'play the system': the politicians, not the applicants with most potential to complete a research project successfully. Finally, my last query about the preprint is related to the final paragraph in the discussion: ""Not surprisingly, SciCV alone had only a limited effect on the adherence to DORA-conformity during evaluation. ... Other funding organisations experimenting with new, text-based CV format such as the Science Foundation Ireland report similar findings [10], highlighting the need for additional accompanying measures such as clear guidelines or training."" With (such) a limited effectiveness of the SciCV/narrative CV, I am curious how the authors come to the conclusion that the ""SciCV was a relevant and successful initiative"". Also, is it worth requiring applicants to put in significantly more effort creating such document for the submission for grant applications with limited effectiveness, and when even then still additional measures are needed for the process to be fair? The authors suggest such measures to be clear guidance and training, which, frankly, assessors and reviewers could easily ignore and let their personal (implicit or explicit) biases guide their assessment or review. So to me, the narrative CV, albeit well intended (and before trying to write one myself I thought this was/could be an amazing intervention) comes across as trying to make life of the reviewers and assessors more easy while creating significantly more work for the applicants, potentially preventing them from even submitting a grant application. Has the narrative CV/SciCV been compared to other interventions that create less work for the applicant and force reviewers/assessors to adhere to DORA and remove any chance for biases to guide assessments/reviews, such as double blind review (e.g.: https://smallpondscience.co...

We were aware of previous observations on Ca2+ leakage, but unfortunately, our current structures do not provide good insights into its mechanism. In all our inhibitor-bound structures, the pore of Sec61 is essentially closed by the plug, and thus it seems unlikely that the channel permeates Ca2+ through its pore in the observed conformations. However, like other structural studies, our study also comes with certain limitations, such as difficulties in gauging the dynamics of the channel complex. Also we cannot rule out other Ca2+ permeation paths besides the central pore. We believe that these aspects are something we will have to look into carefully in the future.

Review synthesized by Michael Robichaux. The manuscript reports findings from new knockout human cell lines for the mitochondrial release factors mtRF1 and mtRF1a. The work contributes new insight into mitochondrial protein translation and mechanisms related to mitochondrial disease. A specific role is demonstrated for the release factor mtRF1 in the translation of COX1, a mitochondrial respiratory protein. The manuscript also identified a compensatory role for the mitochondrial ribosome-associated quality control (mtRQC) pathway when mitochondrial translation termination is impaired. Overall the experiments and results presented in the manuscript are supportive of the conclusions described in the text. These findings are impactful toward understanding mitochondrial translation termination. Major comments In the results section related to Figure 1d, an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) is measured using the mitoSOX probe. Considering that mitoSOX measures superoxide accumulation in the mitochondria, please consider specifying in the text that the ROS measured is of mitochondrial origin. In addition, since mitoSOX labeling may be affected by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential or mitochondrial shape and size, please consider adding an experimental condition using a membrane-potential-responsive, redox-insensitive probe. Finally, please clarify the results presented in Figure 1d with more technical detail. What do the n-values signify? Technically, how is ROS production measured? For Figure 2b-d, in gel activity for complex I and IV are measured; please provide further technical details for these experiments. Please describe what kind of activity is being measured and how it is measured. Also consider adding a density graph of these gel data for clarification of the results. Referencing Figure 2b-c, specifically, it is stated in the Results section that “ mtRF1 loss does not affect complex I.. ”; however, the figure shows an increase in activity of ~20% for the mtRF1-/- condition. Please consider rephrasing or clarifying this point. For Figure 3, there is a possible discrepancy in these results that may need to be addressed. For example, the difference of the relative intensity of ND6 between the WT vs. mtRF1a-/- conditions shown in Fig 3a is significantly less than what is quantified for the same comparison in the bar graph in Fig 3e. It is possible these analyses were performed differently; if so, please report this. Minor comments It is stated in the first Results section: “ In the absence of mtRF1a, cells tend to produce more reactive oxygen species (ROS)... ”, which is vague, please rewrite more technically since it is describing the quantitative data in Fig 1D. From this same section, the final statement: “Thus, both release factors are critical for mitochondrial function and cellular growth” is perhaps too conclusive based only on the results from Figure 1. Related to Fig 1c: consider converting the graph to a log scale, which may help illustrate the difference in growth rates between conditions. In addition to measuring cellular growth, please also consider measuring/counting mitochondria and examining cell morphology changes, which may be easy, additive experiments to include here. In the Results section related to Fig. 2a-d, the respiratory chain complexes are presented with no context. Consider mentioning these complexes in the Introduction or contextualizing them better in this section. In this same Results section please add appropriate citations for “Figure 2g” when referencing results related to that figure panel. A portion of the results text related to Figure 4a-b states: “ With the exception of MTND6 (mRNA encoding for ND6), all of the mt-mRNAs arise from the polycistronic transcript synthesized from the heavy strand. If the loss of mitochondrial RFs would affect mitochondrial transcription, one would expect an overall decrease in all mitochondrial transcripts. However, as we observe a selective decrease in specific transcripts in the individual knockouts, we conclude that it is more likely an issue of RNA stability rather than synthesis.” This may be more appropriate to include in the Discussion section. In the Results section related to Figure 5, please again consider properly citing the figures when describing the results presented in those figures and panels. While Figure 6 is an informative model figure, please consider explaining the model with respect to results in the manuscript. Comments on reporting Please consider adding more detail in the Methods section about the statistical analyses performed in this study. In addition, other statistical tests may be needed for some group comparisons (e.g., two-way ANOVA for the data in Fig. 5d). For all the western blot data presented in the manuscript, please consider adding the full blot scans to the supplemental material.

Review synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. The paper studies the involvement of aneuploidy in promoting chromosomal instability and suggests the aneuploid state of cancer cells as a point-mutation independent source of genome instability. The paper reports a considerable amount of data. We outline below some suggestions regarding presentation and the analyses reported: ‘ mis-segregation in otherwise pseudo-diploid human cells’ - Please provide some explanation for the term ‘pseudo-diploid’. ‘ suggesting that dormant replication origins’ - Please provide a sentence clarifying the meaning of ‘dormant replication’. ‘Cells activate dormant origins in response to reduced fork rate and stalled forks to ensure that the genome gets fully replicated in time ’ - Please provide a reference to support this statement. Figure 3 Recommend re-arranging the order and position of the panels for greater clarity. ‘ Interestingly, we found a positive correlation between S phase length and frequency of abnormal mitoses (mean S phase length in control: 603,3 ± 55,4; aneuploid: 728,7 ± 46,2) (Fig. 3c). ’ - Figure 3C shows that the cells that have an abnormal mitosis had a slightly longer S phase on average, however there is no correlation analysis done or an analysis around ""frequency of abnormal mitosis"", recommend revising the sentence. more photo-toxicity -> abnormal mitosis. Recommend adding a control to account for the potential phototoxicity of the imaging. Figure 4 - Panels C and D show that, among the cells that have foci, the number of foci is increased, either by aneuploidy or by the drugs. However, it is unclear from the data if the number of cells with foci also increases. Would it be possible to plot the % of cells with more than 1 foci for each condition? (as in Figure 4G). Also, C and D are aggregates of multiple experiments, it would be good to show the data per replicates. ‘there was a sub-population of senescent cells in the aneuploid sample (Fig. 5a) ’ - Was senescence tested in the normal (euploid) population too (at the same passage)? Is that the sample named as ""control"" in the figure legend? ‘ in aneuploid cycling cells was comparable to that of the controls for at least 3 generations by live-cell imaging (Fig. 6a-c) ’ - Suggest clarifying here what the control is, in addition to naming it in the figure legend. Comments on analyses/reporting In various figures (including Figures 1H,J,L,N,O; 2C,G,E; 3I; 4C,D; 5H,I; 6H,I,J), there is a concern about the statistical approach to calculate p-values based on multiple measurements or cells within each sample. The t-test assumes that each measurement is independent, and multiple cells within the same sample are not independent. Recommend either not reporting p-values or averaging together the values from each sample and calculating the p-value using those sample-level means. For more information, see https://doi.org/10.1371/jou... and https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb... For each bar graph throughout the paper, recommend reporting the value of n, in the figure itself, the figure legend, or in the text. Using Figure 1C as an example, this reports a doubling in the number of cells with greater than 10 errors, but the significance of that would vary depending on the number of cells analyzed. Some plots in panels c and f have no error bars, and it would be useful to report the number of experiments. Almost every figure features representative images. The manuscript includes a massive amount of data already, but it may be relevant to show additional images in the supplement in cases where representative images are used in figures.

Review synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. The manuscript studies the role of the long-coding RNA lncRNA H19 in cellular senescence. The results show that H19 levels decline as cells undergo senescence and repression of H19 is triggered by the loss of CTCF and prolonged activation of p53. The loss of H19 leads to increased let7b-mediated targeting of EZH2. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin maintains lncRNA H19 levels throughout the cellular lifespan preventing reduction of EZH2 and cellular senescence. The reviewers found the methodology appropriate but raised some comments and suggestions about the paper as outlined below: Introduction ‘ H19 is a highly conserved, maternally expressed imprinted gene and encodes a 2.3 kb long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). It is located immediately downstream of the neighboring gene IGF2.’ - An additional reference to the expression pattern/levels of lncRNA H19 across 'normal' tissues/developmental stages would be useful to provide immediate insight into the contexts where H19 is important and note the conditions where its levels are altered. ‘ To characterize the role of H19 in the cellular senescence of somatic cells, we examined H19 expression during replicative senescence of human cardiac fibroblasts ’ - The data on changes in expression of H19 with age/culture time is very interesting. Suggest providing some comments on the choice of experimental systems for each experiment and why HCF cells were used to study replicative senescence while other experiments were completed in skin samples. Figure 1 Figure 1a - Please indicate in the legend how far apart or what are the passage numbers for 'early' and 'late' passages for the cell culture experiments. Is the reduction in H19 gradual or does it sharply decrease after a certain number of passages? What biological meaning would either of these observations have and how does it relate to mouse data in vivo? Supplementary Figure 1 shows a sharp drop between PD 20 and PD 50. Would it be possible to provide a finer analysis of H19 levels across many cell passages? Figure 1b - Recommend using the same normalization in a) and b). In a) levels are normalized to the first condition ""early"" while in b) levels are normalized to the second condition ""old"". Figures 1d and g - Please provide further information on how Cumulative population doublings were measured and clarification for the numbers on the Y axis. ‘ decreased the lifespan of cells (Figure 1d; Figure 1-figure supplement 1c) ’ - Figure 1d measures cells' doubling time, not lifespan. If lifespan is being inferred from doubling time, please provide some clarification on how this is being done. There are fewer cells after 15 days but it does not mean that cells are dying, it could be that they are growing slower. Please also provide details for the methodology followed to obtain the data in this panel. Figure 2 ‘ CTCF mRNA and protein levels decreased in the late passage cells (Figure 2a and b), and CTCF knockdown in early passage cells induced premature senescence characterized by increased SA-β-gal staining and reduction in proliferation (Figure 2-figure supplement 2a). In contrast, treatment with rapamycin mitigated CTCF depletion, which is consistent with the effect of rapamycin maintaining H19 levels (Figure 2a and b). Furthermore, the regulatory link between CTCF and H19 is supported by decreased H19 expression in CTCF-targeted cells (Figure 2c). ’ - CTCF knockdown and rapamycin treatment can affect many pathways, recommend toning down this conclusion. In Supplemental Figure 2a, the % of positive cells in the siNeg condition is significantly higher than in Figure 1e (close to 50% in Sup Fig 2a vs 30 % in Fig 1e). Recommend providing some comments on the variability of the control value as that level of variability can confound the conclusions. For example, the siCTCF condition is lower than the siNeg control condition when compared with the value from Sup Fig 2a but not when compared with the value from Fig 1e. Figure 2d - Remove""presentation last saved just now"" from the panel. ‘ a stress-dependent downregulation of CTCF through proteasomal degradation of CTCF protein in endothelial cells (51)’ - The paper cited here discusses epithelial cells, should the reference to endothelial cells be updated? Figure 3 - Please provide further clarification regarding acute stress or prolonged activation of p53. What are the timescales? How do these relate to replicative senescence seen with aging or as cells at late passages? ‘ Together these results confirm that activation of p53 is responsible for the downregulation of H19 as part of DNA damage response ’ - Please provide further clarification regarding the reference to DNA damage. Is this an inference from the statement about ""activation of p53 is crucial for establishing senescence as part of DDR""? p53, like CTCF and mTOR, can play different roles. ‘ Given the mounting evidence suggesting the role of lncRNA H19 as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) or miRNA sponge (60–62), we speculated that H19 might mediate the senescence program by regulating miRNA availability. To determine which miRNAs are directly regulated by lncRNA H19 during senescence, we evaluated miRNA expression profiles in control and H19 targeted cells (Figure 4a). ’ - Can some further clarification be provided for this claim, if H19 is acting as a miRNA sponge, it wouldn't affect its overall levels, but rather its ability to bind its target genest? Based on the data presented, the link between let7b and H19 appears to be more related to let7b expression than sequestration. Consider removing the fragment or revising it to clarify the mechanistic link drawn between H19 and let7b. To show that H19 is acting as a sponge in this system, it may be necessary to mutate the complementary sequence and check whether let7b's activity increases (i.e. its target genes are down-regulated). ‘ Among the top miRNAs upregulated in H19 depleted cells were members of the let7 family; specifically, let7b expression was significantly upregulated (Figure 4b ’ - Suggest adding some more information about the other miRNAs that are affected. Figure 4f ‘ Senescence-associated secretory ’ - Please clarify why SERPINE mRNA level is considered instead of IL-6 as in Figure 1f. ‘ suggests the loss of EH2 results in a general decrease in PRC2 activity ’ - should EH2 read EZH2? Figure 5 - What happens to CDKN2A levels when H19 is depleted or overexpressed? Can the H3Kme3 antibody binding data be supported with expression data for CDKN2A? It may be relevant to see whether it follows the expectation that loss of H19 reduces EZH2 expression and increases p16 expression. Figure 6 - Please provide some brief clarification for what the solid and dashed lines represent in the model. ‘ More importantly, prolonged treatment with mTOR inhibitor rapamycin maintains lncRNA H19 levels by preventing the loss of CTCF expression and activation of p53, thus preventing the induction of senescence. ’ - There is a question as to whether the experiments presented support this statement, suggest reframing the fragment. The strongest mechanistic experiments in the study are those regarding let7b, because they use the mimic to ""rescue"" its function. Supplementary Figure 1d - It is nice to see authors tested 2 different siRNAs for H19 and these showed the same effect in Panel d. Can some discussion be provided for why overexpression of H19 leads to an increase in senescence markers and reduced proliferation.The outcomes of siRNA experiments may not sufficiently support the correlation between H19 levels and senescence induction. This is an example where both excess H19 and reduced levels of H19 have the same effect and it is a very important result. Would it be possible to titrate the expression of H19 to achieve different levels of overexpression and then analyze senescence markers under these conditions? It may also be possible to generate a siRNA-resistant overexpression construct to rescue the effects seen with siRNA-mediated depletion of H19. Supplementary Figure 5 - Recommend updating the presentation to more clearly highlight the decrease in binding as mentioned in the main text. Methods ‘ 10g of plasmid DNA was transfected ’ - should this read 10 micrograms? ‘ ΔΔCT method ’ - Please clarify the control for calculating relative mRNA levels. ‘ Cells were incubated with EdU stain (100mM Tris (pH8.5), 1mM CuSO4, 1.25 μM Azide Fluor 488, and 50mM ascorbic acid) at room temperature for 30 mins.

Leroux we have written an extended commentary with our opinion on the work, which can be found in the link: https://www.qeios.com/read/.... In short, we find that the authors do not properly cite previous work, notably the Gao and Harris paper (2006) that reaches similar conclusions. In addition, the introduction fails to acknowledge even basic issues. For example, the classical PKCs are constitutively phosphorylated by PDK1 without growth factor signaling. Akt/PKB becomes phosphorylated by PDK1 in a  PI3-kinase dependent manner but also has been described to become phosphorylated by PDK1 in a PI3-kinase INDEPENDENT manner. In contrast to what Levina et al. indicate in the introduction, a model to explain PDK1 phosphorylation of substrates must take into consideration that some substrates are phosphorylated in a PIP3-independent manner! For a detailed commentary on the results section, again I recommend that you go to the qeios link above. Most of the hard biochemistry in the paper is dedicated to describing the dimer that must be formed along the very very slow process of trans-autophosphorylation in vitro. The hard-core biochemical studies are based on a fusion of PDK1 to PIF. It is difficult to understand what useful information can be obtained from those ""dimers""... PIF binds with high affinity to PDK1: what would be the sense of crosslinking GST-PIF to PDK1? would you obtain any information about the  GST/ PDK1 heterodimers??? If the model was correct, PIFtide should inhibit trans-autophosphorylation. The authors did not do this control experiment. But it was done previously: this was NOT observed in the paper by Frödin et al (2000). So the dimer model with an important hydrophobic motif binding to the PIF-pocket in the neighbour molecule is very likely incorrect. Finally the authors claim autoinhibition by the PH domain and release of this autoinhibition by PIP3. I have not yet seen any convincing data to support the existence of an autoinhibited PDK1. Please, refer to the qeios link for further details. In short, I believe that the conclusion of this part of the work is also not supported by their data nor by 25 years of careful work by different laboratories.",2022-08-14T20:38:52,ricardombiondi,Ricardo M.

We see that cryopreserved cells have better cell quality, higher UMI and higher gene counts. We haven't test the ambient DNA, but given that cells are not permeabilized, I would assume that should also be true. Yet, there are two things to consider: 1) Given that your cells are alive they get stressed when you thaw them, and this is reflected in their transcriptome. Not really strongly, but it is something to consider. 2) DMSO is toxic for cells and some cells, such as neurons, are more sensitive to it. In our analyes we observed a significant depletion of neurons in the DMSO cryopreserved samples (and not using any other preservation method). We think this may be due to DMSO toxicity or simply because neurons are more fragile and survive worse freezing/thawing cycles. In any case, it impacts the cell composition. So, if you wanna study neurons, as in our case, with DMSO you are loosing lots of them and getting more progenitor cells instead (that survive better the freezing/thawing cycles).",2022-08-10T10:58:29,mireyaplass,Mireya Plass,10.1101/2022.08.03.502652,Methanol fixation is the method of choice for droplet-based single-cell transcriptomics of neural cells,"Ana Gutiérrez-Franco, Mohamed N.

Authors: Oana M. Enache, Veronica Rendo, Rameen Beroukhim, Todd R. Golub and Uri Ben-David A couple of years ago we reported Cas9-induced p53 signaling in cancer cell lines (ref 1). Here, Guo and Xiong address the possibility that this finding is affected by cell line sex biases (ref 2). In their preprint, they are trying to make 3 points related to our paper. We will address each of these points separately. 1) TP53 mutations also shrink and not only expand upon Cas9 introduction. To study the trend of p53-inactivating mutations to expand or shrink following Cas9 introduction, we performed an analysis of pre-existing subclonal mutations (Fig. 3d in ref1). As mentioned in our paper several times, we deliberately restricted this analysis to pre-existing mutations with 0.02 1% in gnomAD (ref3); see Supplementary Data 3 and our exclusion criteria described in the Methods section of ref1). We therefore think that it is a mistake to consider this mutation as an ‘inactivating TP53 mutation’ as well. Importantly, if one were to include the clonal inactivating mutations that Guo and Xiong have added to our analysis in their Fig. 1a2, then there is no justification for the exclusion of mutations that were not detected at all (AF~0) in the parental cell line but were present in the Cas9-expressing cell line, such as the mutation observed in the cell line SNU1 (Fig. 3c in ref1). However, this event was excluded in Fig. 1a of ref2. Similarly, if one were to include known SNPs in the analysis, then there is no reason to exclude the one in the cell line JHH7, which emerged from AF=0 to AF=1 (and was excluded both from our original analysis and from Fig. 1a2). In other words, the inclusion criteria for Fig. 1a of ref2 are inconsistent. Lastly, if we add the clonal mutations to the analysis (but exclude the known SNPs), there is still a significant trend for the expansion of TP53-inactivating mutations (p=0.03 in a one-tailed McNemar test for directionality). Guo and Xiong’s statement that they found “significantly shrinking inactivating subclonal mutations of TP53 in Cas9-cells, which means Cas9 also selects against TP53 inactivating mutations” (Abstract of 2) is therefore misleading. (We note that Guo and Xiong report that “four inactivating mutations from four cell lines were shrinking (P=0.039)”, but their manuscript does not provide any information about the statistical test that was applied to calculate significance.) 2) There is a potential sex-bias in our results. We did not test whether any of our results were affected by a potential sex bias. Given that p53 has an effect on X chromosome inactivation, we cannot rule out the possibility that sex may affect p53 signaling following Cas9 introduction. However, sex representation in our cell line cohort was very balanced, and Cas9-induced p53 activation and selection were found in both male and female lines. Of the 43 TP53-WT lines used for the gene expression analyses, 21 were female, 21 were male, and one was of unknown sex; of the 122 TP53-mutant lines, 62 were female, 59 were male, and one was of unknown sex. Moreover, we used TP53-WT cell lines from both sexes (3 male lines, 2 female lines, 1 of unknown sex) to validate p53 activation following Cas9 introduction, and detected p53 pathway activation in both the male and the female lines (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2 in ref1). Of the 10 cell lines in which a TP53 mutation was found to emerge or expand (Fig. 2c,d in ref1), 6 were female and 4 were male. Therefore, there is no evidence for any sex bias in these results. While Guo and Xiong raise an interesting hypothesis, they do not provide any real evidence that any of our results were indeed affected by sex bias. Instead, they make a few anecdotal statements on the matter: a) “The largest fold-change of p53 activation was observed in a female cell line (BT159)”. This is meaningless, as we tested the mRNA expression in 165 cell lines and protein expression in 9 cell lines. Guo and Xiong do not report any systematic comparison of the expression changes between male and female cell lines (although all of the data necessary for such analysis are available in our original paper). b) “There were more DNA damage foci in MCF7, which is a female cell line”. This assay was performed in only 3(!) cell lines, precluding any meaningful interpretation of sex bias. We also note that Cas9-induced p53 activation was actually mild in MCF7, compared to other male and female cell lines (Fig. 2e in 1), further weakening this particular anecdotal claim. c) “The largest TP53-inactivating subclonal mutations expanding or shrinking (293T, HCC1419, and OVK18) is seen in female lines”. This claim does not hold true if OVK18 is removed from the analysis. Moreover, according to Fig. 1a of ref2, 2 out 4 shrinking mutations and 4 out of 10 expanding mutations are actually seen in male lines, so the trend of mutations to expand or to shrink seems to be pretty sex-balanced. d) In the final paragraph of their manuscript, Guo and Xiong state that “We think the possible sex-biased effects of Cas9 may provide a possible reason for their failure to detect p53 activation in Cas9-expressing HCT116 (male) cells."" This is factually wrong. We found significant activation of p53 in HCT116 cells transduced with Cas9, as is clearly shown in Extended Data Fig. 2d and 2e of ref1. We note that the majority of the manuscript by Guo and Xiong (Fig. 1b-d, Supplementary Fig. S1-S4, Supplementary Table S1) is an analysis of sex bias in CRISPR screens, which does not directly pertain to our paper. Sex biases in CRISPR screens may have nothing to do with the Cas9-induced p53 signaling that we observed. Moreover, we compared CRISPR to shRNA screens and found significant differences associated with p53 mutation status (Fig. 5 in ref1). Guo and Xiong do not discuss this at all, nor do they provide any evidence that this analysis was affected by cell line sex bias. 3) TP53 mutation status of some cell lines is inaccurate in our paper. The Supplementary Note of 2 reads: ""We found that 11 cell lines (RERFLCAI, SISO, SNU761, COV644, COLO684, HS294T, G292CLONEA141B1, D283MED, G401, SJSA1, and SNU1041) used as TP53-WT (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Data 5 in ref.1) by Enache et al. actually have non-silent TP53 mutations (Supplementary Table S2), although this should not affect their conclusions."" There are 698 cell lines in Supplementary Data 5 and Fig. 5a, and we clearly did not validate the TP53 mutation status of each individually, but rather followed established annotations. There are several ways to classify TP53 mutation status in cell lines, and mutation calling algorithms constantly evolve. As described in our Methods section (ref1), we followed the annotations by Giacomelli et al. (ref4), which are based on the CCLE cell line annotations (ref5), according to which all of the 11 cell lines listed above are TP53-WT. These annotations have since been updated, however, and in the version downloaded by Guo and Xiong (22Q2, https://depmap,org/portal/), these cell lines are now classified as TP53-mutant. Importantly, exclusion of these cell lines has no effect on the outcome of the single analysis in which they were used (Fig. 5a in 1; p=8.8x10-6 instead of the original p=2.7x10-5; one-tailed t-test). Therefore, the slight discrepancy between the annotations used by us and those used by Guo and Xiong is irrelevant to the points that they raise. In summary, we thank Guo and Xiong for raising the intriguing possibility that sex may affect the cellular response to Cas9, in particular in the context of p53 pathway activation. However, this question remains open for now, as more research and data analysis are needed to determine whether this speculation is correct. References 1. Enache, O. & Rendo V. et al.

Review synthesized by Richa Arya. In the manuscript titled “Nanog organizes transcription bodies” Kuznetsova et al. discuss how the transcriptional bodies are assembled. They show that Nanog and Sox19b cluster before the transcription actually starts and initiate the formation of transcription bodies. The following comments and suggestions were raised to help strengthen the manuscript: 1. Result: RNA Pol II transcription localizes to two transcription bodies when zebrafish genome activates… The heading of the section is a bit confusing. Does it refer to the transcription of RNA pol II or transcripts of RNA pol II? Within the result section: ‘…as 64-cell stage… ’ Would be good for the reader to clarify that this is division number 6 to make it clearer that it is way earlier than what is reported in the previous sentence. ‘...productive transcription starts in two transcription bodies in the nucleus. These transcription bodies are isolated, large, long-lived, and appear at a predictable time during development… ’.  At this stage the study has reported localization data but not activity data (this is included later). The formation of clusters (which is what is detected) might suggest but cannot conclude about the activity of the enzyme or whether RNA is actually being produced. 2. Figure 1 ‘…the percentage of nuclei with at least one Pol II (Ser5P or Ser2P) cluster is indicated… ’. The injection is happening at the 1-cell stage. Then observations are made at the 64/128/256 cell stage. Are all the nuclei labelled at these stages? or only a subset? Recommend providing some clarification about the percentages reported? Are they a consequence of the embryo being mosaic, some cells containing the label injected at the 1-cell stage and some not? Or is it biological noise? Or a combination of both? Is this the ratio of (# of cells with puncta)/(total # of cells) or is it (# of cells with puncta)/(# of cells containing some labelled Pol II)? ' C. Tracks of transcription bodies at 64-, 128-, and 256-cell stage. The presence of Pol II Ser5P, Ser2P, or both, is indicated by red, blue, and white circles, respectively. Time on the x-axis in minutes after mitosis. ’. The sample size seems too small, can some clarification be provided to help with the interpretation of this data: In the first plot, one embryo is 64 cells. Even taking in consideration the fact that the embryo might be a mosaic with 50% of the cells labelled and that one can not image all of the cells due to the thickness of the sample, it should leave a few cells imaged per embryo (5-10 cells). It would be good if one experimental replication was made of multiple embryos injected in parallel. So, with all these considerations, the 20-ish tracks displayed on the first plots seem like a small number. If one experimental replicate is 3-4 embryos and 5 cells can be imaged per embryo then around 20 tracks would be the result of 1 replicate (vs 3 as indicated in the methods). If 10% of the cells can be imaged at 256-cell stage, with 3 replicates each made of multiple embryos, it would give more than 60-ish tracks. ‘ For wt, N=3, n=111; for mir430 mutant N=3, n=72… ’. Please clarify what the two n refer to in the figure legend? The methods state "" A minimum of 3 biological and 3 technical replicates was generated for each experiment. The number of experimental replicates (N) as well as the number of measured nuclei (n) are reported for each conducted experiment individually in the respective figure legend."" - Recommend including a shorter but similar clarification in the figure legend. 3. Result: Transcription factors cluster prior to, and independent of transcription ' and visualized each transcription factor in combination with the initiating form of RNA Pol II (Figure 2A, and Movies S4-6… ’ Suggest adding a clarification about when zygotic translation starts in zebrafish and whether translation starts before transcription in zygotes. ‘ We conclude that transcription factors cluster prior to, and independent of transcription elongation. ’ From the data it should be possible to estimate a mean delta T from TF clustering to Pol II clustering, it may be relevant to report such a number. 4. Figure 2: Pairwise non-parametric Wilcoxon tests: There is a concern about the use of a pairwise test as the two conditions CTRL and amanitin are two different conditions. 5. Result: RNA accumulation results in dissociation of transcription factor clusters ‘...the appearance of RNA Pol II Ser5P (initiation) clusters was also delayed in the absence of transcription elongation (Figure 2E)… ’. Suggest calculating the delta in time between TF cluster appearance and Pol II cluster (as suggested above). It appears the ""delay"" in the apparition of the Pol II puncta is the delay observed for the TF, which would indicate that with or without transcription Pol II joins the TF cluster at the same time. ‘…while accumulation of RNA causes them to dissolve… ’. Is this based on the observation that inhibition of transcription results in a longer cluster lifetime? RNA accumulation might promote clusters to dissolve, but whether it is the ""cause"" of their dissolution has not been tested. Recommend reframing the fragment to avoid conclusions about RNA accumulation. 6. Result: Nanog organizes transcription bodies '…cycle (Figure 3A)… '. There is a concern about comparing Nanog and Sox apparition time if they are not observed within the same embryo / nuclei. The present data are convolved by variations between embryos and between nuclei, recommend providing some clarification and looking at the time difference between each TF and the corresponding Pol II cluster. ‘...Nanog RNA Pol II Ser5P could still be detected… ’. Suggest re-phrasing this part as ""to determine if RNA Pol II Ser5P could still be detected in the absence of Nanog"". 7. Figure 3. ‘ In C-D, the percentage of nuclei with the indicated pattern is indicated… ’.  Suggest some further clarification about the percentages reported. In C does this indicate that 9 % of the cells form Sox clusters in absence of Nanog? And in D that 27 % of cells form Pol II clusters in absence of Nanog? If that is the case, recommend discussing it as it might impact the conclusion that Nanog is ""required"" for Pol II clustering. ' Pairwise non-parametric Wilcoxon tests were performed, ns indicates P > 0.05… '. Reconsider the use of pairwise tests, as noted above. 8. Figure 4 - ‘ percentages indicate how often the shown phenotype is observed. For D and E, N ≥ 3 and n ≥ 18. ’ - Please clarify how these percentages are calculated. Is this the percentage of nuclei with the described phenotype per embryo? Or the percentage of embryos with at least one nucleus with the depicted phenotype? In Figure 1 the percentage for Pol II in WT at 128-cell stage is 80%. Figure 4 reports 100%, is it evaluating the same thing? If it is preferable not to write exactly N and n values for all the conditions, maybe these could be shown in the figure itself. 9. Result: Nanog DBD as well as IDR are required to organize transcription bodies ‘ In this study we analyzed the assembly of two transcription bodies… ’. Recommend placing this under a separate Discussion/conclusions section. ‘…and RNA accumulates, transcription factor clusters disassemble. ’ It is not clear that the statement is supported by the data, consider reframing the fragment. 10.

Also consider depositing the custom scripts to a public platform such as github or zenodo where these materials can be publicly accessed and referenced, supporting reproducibility. ‘ Preparation of embryos for use in live-cell microscopy….At 16- to 32-cell stage… ’.

Review synthesized by Michael Robichaux. The manuscript presents a cryo-electron microscopy focused study of a recombinant type V-K CRISPR-associated Cas12k transposon recruitment complex from Scytonema hofmanni that is DNA-bound and includes a complete R-loop formation. In addition to mapping the assembly and interactions within this transposon complex, the study also details the discovery of ribosomal protein S15 as an essential component for the transposition activity of the complex. The work presented in this manuscript may contribute to the development of new programmable CRISPR-associated genome-engineering tools in eukaryotic cells. Major comments - The figures in the manuscript are generally well-organized and clear. In particular, the 2D diagram of the Cas12k-TnsC complex in Figure 1A is a useful figure panel; however, please consider refining the diagram for readability by replacing the current nucleotide sequence rearrangement with simpler shapes or graphics. - For the structural complex models in Figure 2, please consider adding annotations that highlight both the completed R-loop as well as the 122॰ angled confirmation of the PAM distal to proximal DNA, which are both features that are highlighted in the Results section text. - The title for the “TniQ nucleates TnsC filament formation” Results section and the title for Figure 4 are both possibly overstated since these mechanistic conclusions are based solely on transposition assay results. - In the discussion, please consider revising the language used to describe the mechanism of transposon complex assembly (the model in Figure 7) to better justify a rationale for proposing a “cooperative” assembly mechanism that is based on the data in this manuscript, which is a structural assessment of the whole complex and its sub-complex interactions. Minor comments - In the first section of Results section, consider adding a description of the recombinant system used to purify the protein complex used for cryo-EM as done for the Figure 1 legend (“V-K CRISPR-associated transposon system from Scytonema hofmanni (Strecker et al., 2019)”). - For Figure S1B, the orientation map is not clear, an adjustment to the color contrast may improve the clarity of this panel. - For the cryo-EM data in Figures S2, please better define the TnsC oligomer organization (i.e., hexameric, variable). Also for Figure S2, please consider improving the image contrast for the angular distribution images in panel B. - For Figure S3, both the incomplete R-loop and the missing Cas12k-sgRNA + TsnC contacts described in the text for this non-productive complex structure are not evident or identifiable in the models presented in the figure. Please consider annotations or descriptions in the figure legend. - For Figure S4, please consider defining all rotations and dispositions that make up the conformational rearrangements in the RuvC domain, as described in the Results section text. - For Figure 2, please consider adding a 2D diagram of the current complex structure in comparison to previously-reported structural models. - The organization of Figure 3 is too busy, please consider re-formatting for clarity. - For Figure S8, please consider including a “zoomed-out” image of the Cas12k+S15 structure. - In the concluding paragraph of the Discussion section, please elaborate more on how the findings from this work may impact the “genome engineering application of CRISPR-associated transposons ”. Comments on reporting - As outlined in Figure S1, 75K particles were used for the final cryo-EM reconstruction of the Cas12k-TsnC recruitment complex. Please consider discussing the structural elements or discrepancies of the other classified particles. - Table S2 and S3 appear to be missing. - In the “TniQ recognizes tracrRNA and R-loop” Results section, please specify which TniQ and tracrRNA mutations reduced transposition activity.

Since the stems of stem-loop structures require parity (Chargaff’s second parity rule) this decreases the false alerting of immune mechanisms by double-stranded self RNAs (1-3). With their base parity less impaired than exons, structural constraints on introns should be less than those on exons. Thus, with more flexibility in the ordering of their bases, introns would seem to have a higher potential for structure. Indeed, Rangan et al. (4) report that yeast “introns include more non-random secondary structure elements compared to coding regions.” What could these structures be doing? They suggest there might have been evolutionary selection for regulatory elements: The widespread presence of structured elements in S. cerevisiae introns raises the possibility that similar motifs and stable secondary structures play a role in introns in higher-order eukaryotes, perhaps forming regulatory elements in human pre-mRNA. While this may be partially correct, it should be noted that eukaryotic pre-RNA structures reflect evolutionary pressures acting directly on both the DNA genomes from which RNAs are transcribed and the RNAs themselves (to ensure their proper functioning). The natural editing of RNA transcripts (pre-mRNA to mRNA) would have included both intron removal (as discussed by the authors) and the removal (or modification) of any exon structures that had primarily operated at the DNA level but were unacceptable at the RNA level. Thus, the structural landscapes of mature mRNAs reflect evolutionary pressures affecting both their cytoplasmic functions (e.g., protein-encoding and purine-loading) and the few (if any) remaining nuclear (DNA) level structural functions that happen to be acceptable (i.e., are neutral) at the mRNA level. It is a laudable goal to detail accurate RNA structures as they might operate within living cells (4). However, genome-level structure functions should not be forgotten. For this purpose, it is of fundamental interest to compare genes under negative Darwinian selection (slow mutation rate) with those under positive Darwinian selection (high mutation rate). In the latter case, protein-encoding functions in yeast should more effectively out-compete nucleic acid structure functions for a place in exons (3). Indeed, when genes under positive selection pressure were examined in higher-order eukaryotes, using computational methods similar to some the authors employ (5), it was found that the base order required for structured stem-loops was more constrained in exons (i.e, less structure). However, the base order required for local intron structures was less constrained (much more structure). Stem-loop potential in introns was conserved more than in exons (6). In other words, a dispersed genome-wide potential for structure - such as might be required to support recombination – seemed to have been diverted from exons to neighboring introns (7). If they have not already done so, I encourage the authors in their future work to compare intron structure landscapes in two classes of yeast genes – those conserved under negative selection and those subject to positive Darwinian selection. 1.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.08.487606v1#comment-5934804686,biorxivstage,1,"Summary: In this paper, the authors have employed Microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) to identify the positions of hydrogen atoms in hen egg-white lysozyme. The major success of the paper results from the continued improvement of MicroED data collection procedures: 35% of hydrogens contained in the structure can be visualized with visible hydrogen bonding networks and hydrogens on water molecules. They were able to locate more hydrogen atoms in the protein backbone than in the side chains owing to more rigidity of the backbone structure. They observe density for acidic side chain residues and their negatively charged side-chain carboxyl groups which are thought to be poorly resolved in single particle cryo-EM at moderate resolution. This observation is tantalizing, but incomplete. By our eye in Fig 2c the “right oxygen” in Asp18” is lower signal than the “left”. Presumably this indicates that the side chain is not protonated - and it is possible that there may be opportunities here to test the strength for “for negatively charged atoms at lower scattering angles” based on such differences in signal. Such an analysis would be very interesting (and potentially using different truncations of the data, truly test this model). The last section of the paper describes that the inter-nuclei distances are more accurate to determine the hydrogen bond lengths than the center of mass of electron clouds, which agrees with the analysis in Molprobity (Williams et al, Protein Science 2018). Comparison to X-ray (which occurs a bit in the discussion) and neutron data (e.g. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... on this point would be very interesting. Further missed opportunities include comparisons of the h signal strength to detection by neutron/X-ray and whether there are any trends that would connect with hydrogen-exchange measurements. Overall, the paper is concise and focuses on the observations enabled by the new data collection improvements, but misses opportunities to connect to other analyses on lysozyme (perhaps the best system to make such comparisons in!) Following are some minor points that we would like to mention: Minor points: Abstract line 18: instead of “informing” it should be “information” Line 61: “Here, hydrogen atoms were identified by omitting them from the model and inspecting the peaks in a calculated Fo–FC difference map following refinement in Servalcat based on crystallographic refinement routines implemented in REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 2011; Yamashita et al., 2021). Since resolution is a local feature in cryo-EM, the accuracy of hydrogen identification varies across the map.” There is some ambiguity in the way we read this. By “here” do the authors mean in the previous single particle EM work to high resolution outlined in the preceding sentences or their current manuscript? If they mean the preceding papers suggest starting the paragraph, “In those works,”; if they mean the current manuscript, the statement about resolution varying across the map needs a more full and nuanced explanation. Line 91: “Lowering the total exposure also reduces the effects of radiation damage that can affect the structural integrity of the protein and the ability to localize hydrogen atoms” It would be interesting to test the radiation damage directly here, but maybe prohibitive across 16 crystals? Line 110: ‘‘Nevertheless, these results are the most complete hydrogen bonding network visualized to date by macromolecular MicroED’’ The authors did a nice comparison of all the hydrogen bonds based on X-ray, MicroED and neutron diffraction. It would be worth mentioning if they were able to identify any new hydrogen bond position or network which was not previously reported, this would further connect to the other methods as mentioned above. Line 127-128: ‘‘Interestingly, whereas the Asp52 and Gly54 N-H distances are close to the idealized positions, the difference peak for the Asn44 N-H is located at an almost equal distance shared between the donor and Asp52 carbonyl acceptor’’ Which idealized positions are the authors referring to? idealized from the neutrons or X-ray or both? There may be settings in Phenix that allow this to be controlled (although REFMAC is used here). Line 182/183: ‘‘The number of observations for some 183 bond types is insufficient for a rigorous statistical analysis’’ The authors can mention which bond observations are significant and the observed bond length elongation. For example, C-H2 has the highest number of observations (99) with a deviation of 15. However, there is no mention for the apparent elongation of bond length in this case. Figure 2d: Label the contour level for the 2 additional water molecules w1079 and w1005. Figure 3: Legend needs explanation for MicroED curve too. Supplementary Table 1: We understand that the overall crystal quality statistics are weak in the case of MicroED. However, the low completeness after merging 16 datasets is not entirely understood and perhaps deserves some comment here. Is there a preferred orientation on the grid that leads to a systematic problem in filling reciprocal space?

We have missed valuable works of Turner et al. 2008 and Trampel et al 2011 while writing the initial version of our manuscript. Now we included them: “However, despite the rich variety of MRI contrasts acquired by the previous work (Barbier et al., 2002; Bollmann et al., 2022; Bridge et al., 2005; Budde et al., 2011; Dinse et al., 2015; Duyn et al., 2007; Federau & Gallichan, 2016; Fracasso et al., 2016; Kemper et al., 2018; Lüsebrink et al., 2021; Lüsebrink et al., 2017; Mattern et al., 2018; Petridou et al., 2010; Sanchez Panchuelo et al., 2021a; Sánchez-Panchuelo et al., 2012; Schira et al., 2022; Tardif et al., 2015; Trampel et al., 2011; Turner et al., 2008; Zwanenburg et al., 2011), there has been no openly accessible quantitative in vivo human T2* measurements at mesoscopic resolution (see Supplementary Table 1).” 1c. Considering the other reviews and comments we have received, we have decided to remove the mesoscopic analysis tool development discussion and novelty claims in our initial manuscript. We agree that such methods discussion is critical and deserves a separate detailed manuscript only focusing on the capabilities and challenges of various analysis strategies and algorithms. 2. We thank you for this detailed explanation. Now we more strongly claim “This structure is the stria of Gennari (Fulton, 1937; Gennari, 1782; Glickstein & Rizzolatti, 1984; Stüber et al., 2014)”. We have also now added a new sentence in the Discussion section: “Faster acquisitions leveraging e.g. echo planar imaging (Sanchez Panchuelo et al., 2021b) are especially needed for clinical populations”. 3. Thank you for this explanation and pointers. Following your advice, we now more strongly state state in Secion 5.1: “T1 contrast is clearly shown to be related to myelination (Leuze et al., 2017; Morawski et al., 2018) and therefore used for delineating areal borders (Cohen-Adad et al., 2012; Deistung et al., 2013; Dick et al., 2012; Dinse et al., 2015; Geyer et al., 2011; Haast et al., 2016; Marques et al., 2017; Sanchez Panchuelo et al., 2021b; Sánchez-Panchuelo et al., 2012).” 4. We have rectified our oversight by including these papers: “However, as argued within (Kuehn et al., 2017; Skeide et al., 2018; Wallace et al., 2016), mesoscopic in vivo imaging may still be insufficient to capture the subtle changes in myeloarchitecture aside from the primary visual cortex where layer IV is extremely thick”. 5. We are glad that you have brought up denoising. Yes, we did try multiple denoising techniques on our images to highlight different spatial features of our images such as layers and vessels. Our preliminary results are promising. However, considering the general criticism that we have received on the first version of our manuscript from other reviews and comments, we decided that detailed investigation of denoising our images is currently outside of the scope of our manuscript. We hope that these changes are sufficiently addressing your concerns, comments and questions. We would be happy to receive further comments on the second version of our manuscript.",2022-07-30T17:53:24,omerfarukgulban,Omer Faruk Gulban,10.1101/2021.11.25.470023,Mesoscopic Quantification of Cortical Architecture in the Living Human Brain,"Omer Faruk Gulban, Saskia Bollmann, Renzo Huber, Konrad Wagstyl, Rainer Goebel, Benedikt A.

To compare our dataset to other state-of-the-art methods we included Supplementary Table 1. It can be seen that, for the last decade, there has not been any mesoscopic T2* imaging. It seems that Budde et al 2011 (at 9.4 T) and Sanchez-Panchuelo et al 2012 (at 7 T) were the last times mesoscopic (<0.5 mm in at least two voxel dimensions) T2* values were measured. Therefore, in combination with other reviews and comments we have received, we have decided to solely focusing on reporting our T2* data. To keep the scope of our manuscript focused, we have decided to leave detailed SNR and CNR analyses for measuring the effectiveness of our blood motion artifact mitigation method for a future manuscript. 2. Although we did not encounter problems downloading our data from OSF, we decided to upload our data to an additional server. We are going to add this new link in the next iteration of our manuscript. For the time being we decided to not rework on our analysis pipelines by incorporating Jupyter notebooks and containers because two users from different institutes had no problem performing similar data acquisition and using our analysis script on their datasets. Based on this, we concluded that our analysis documentation is satisfactory for now. However, we are going to consider this advice in our next project. 3. We have added figure legends to Figure 1 (but forgot to compile with this new version in the last moment before updating bioRxiv, so the updated Figure 1 can be seen here). More substantially, now we provide Supplementary Figures 3 and 4 to qualitatively show the image stability across runs. In addition, we have downgraded the position and importance of our MP2RAGE T1 dataset in our manuscript. Now we state in section 2.2.2: “These T1 data were acquired primarily for cortical gray matter segmentation purposes and were not intended to serve as quantitative T1 measurement”. Also, now we report the MP2RAGE T1 results in Appendix A rather than within the main text with a disclaimer: “We highlight that our primary focus for acquiring the T 1 contrast was for cortical gray matter segmentation. Therefore, we have used a speed-optimized MP2RAGE sequence that provided good contrasts for cortical segmentation purposes. However, we believe that there could be some value in reporting our findings”. As a note, we did acquire field maps (considering Marques and Gruetter 2013) but did not use them as we are now not focusing on T1 quantification. However, although only visually, it can be seen that the scan-rescan similarity of our imager seems high in Supplementary Figures 3 and 4. These MP2RAGE T1 images served us very well during tissue segmentation. 4. The reason behind 6/8 partial fourier in MP2RAGE was to shorten our single data acquisition run durations to be able to get more repetitions. We have chosen this strategy during piloting because single run MP2RAGE images were visibly more noisy compared to our ME GRE images (see Supplementary Figure 3 and 4). We did mention our Bandwidth in Table 1 (250 Hz/Px under MP2RAGE column) in the initial version of our manuscript. However this information was missing from the “Data Acquisition” text. Now we have fixed this oversight. For our discussion section, now we added the sentence “Faster acquisitions leveraging e.g. echo planar imaging (Sanchez Panchuelo et al., 2021b) are especially needed for clinical populations.”. EPI is proven to be a big time saver that comes at a cost of image distortions and larger sampling time windows that can cause mixing of T2* signal sampled over longer durations. We have addressed the minor points. Not mentioning the manufacturer or the field strength was an oversight. Now we mention “using 7T MRI (Siemens) with a 32-channel Rx head coil (Nova)” in the data acquisition section. We have also updated our title to mention the field strength: “Mesoscopic in vivo human T2* dataset acquired using quantitative MRI at 7 Tesla”.",2022-07-30T17:09:38,omerfarukgulban,Omer Faruk Gulban,10.1101/2021.11.25.470023,Mesoscopic Quantification of Cortical Architecture in the Living Human Brain,"Omer Faruk Gulban, Saskia Bollmann, Renzo Huber, Konrad Wagstyl, Rainer Goebel, Benedikt A.

Review synthesized by Vasanthanarayan Murugesan. In this preprint, the authors describe a novel pathway that maintains protein homeostasis in cells recovering from heat stress termed stress-induced protein disaggregase activation pathway (siDAP). siDAP induces the DNAJA1+DNAJB1-Hsp70 protein disaggregase and targets aggregates of tightly misfolded proteins. This pathway is distinct from more-known ubiquitin-dependent quality control and works in sequence with it. Further, the authors show that this pathway is compromised in aging cells. The authors have provided a wealth of convincing data to support the claims made. The following items were raised: Major comments Manuscript It is recommended to revise the manuscript to better integrate the data and the text. The paper provides extensive data to support the study claims, but further background material for the experiments in the introductory or results section would support interpretation e.g., concepts required to understand the final two figures are not discussed in the introduction. Reducing the number of supplementary figures may make the manuscript easier to follow and help in tightening the narrative. Experiments Results ‘ Immediately after HS, DNAJA1 and DNAJB1 rapidly relocalized to nucleoli’ - It is unclear from the DAPI stain what happens to the nucleolus at 0h after HS. It seems to be present in some cells but not all. Could a marker of the nucleolus be used and/or some clarification included? Results ‘ This suggests that predominantly newly synthesized DNAJA1 and DNAJB1 molecules drive the assemblage of the DNAJA1+DNAJB1-Hsp70 disaggregase in cells after HS ’ - Fig S5D shows that B1 forms puncta after HS even in CHX treated cells, which suggests that protein synthesis is not needed. Can some clarification be added for this fragment. Results ‘ diffuse GFP fluorescent signal (cyan) indicating that protein aggregates were largely absent ’ - The presence of aggregates or puncta before HS cannot be ruled out, the puncta or aggregate could be too small to be resolved. Recommend commenting on this. Results ‘ Blocking Hsp70 activity by VER-155008 also caused DNAJA1+DNAJB1 scaffolds to persist up to 24h after HS, presumably due to their continuous association with the aggregates (Figure 2D). ’ - The HSP70 aggregates look different after treatment with VER, they look more like the A1/B1 puncta than in the DMSO condition, it may be worth commenting on this. In Figure 6, the distinction between biological aging and replicative aging could be stated more clearly. Cell lines derived from donors of different biological ages form siDAP puncta and recover from heat shock. However, the cells lose this ability when cultured in dishes at passage 12 or 18 irrespective of biological age. Hence it is not clear if passaging cells mimics biological aging with regard to protein homeostasis. Minor comments Figure 1H: Recommend including some comments on why the size of HSF is more at 0 hr, and commenting on whether HSF-1 depletion changes HSP70 levels. Figure 2 (B-D) - The size of cells in U vs 0 hour appear different, the 0 hr cells look bigger. Suggest adding a scale bar and clarification on whether the magnification is the same. In Figure S4/S5, it is hard to infer the state of the nucleolus during stress with DAPI staining and subsequently the localization of DNAJA1 and DNAJB1 to the nucleolus is not clear. In Figure S4D, it is shown that CHX doesn’t affect the formation of puncta but the text states that newly synthesized DNAJA1 and DNAJB1 are required for the assembly of DNAJA1-DNAJB1-HSP70. Please provide some clarification for this contradiction. In Fig S8, statistical analysis of different siDAP induction is suggested. In Fig 3, please provide clarification for the choice of experiments in CHX-treated cells for testing the effect of VER-155008. In Fig 5, the caption mentions cells with/without VER-155008 treatment which cannot be seen in the figure. ‘ In fact, we found that human cells can tune the activation of siDAP according to the level of protein damage sustained after HS ’ - It may be informative to check if the cytotoxicity levels differ from HS at 39ºC and at 42ºC. In Fig 6, quantification of PLA^Dt, similar to Fig 1F is suggested. Please also report the conditions used for heat shock in these experiments, 42oC for 2 hrs? ‘ Moreover, siDAP was fully active in all fibroblast lines tested (Figure 6A; Figure S22A and B). Similar to immortalized HeLa cells, primary dermal fibroblasts only induced the DNAJA1+DNAJB1 JDP scaffold after HS (Figure S22C) ’ -  May be worth mentioning that the apparently higher intensity of the fluorescence signal in the cells derived from aged subjects. The fluorescence signal per cell looks much greater in 70 yo (Fig. S22 only) and 75 yo (Figs. 6 and S22). The next few lines discuss the relevance of decreased fluorescence (representative of loss of siDAP induction) with serial passaging/replicative age. However, upon HS, siDAP signal seems to go up with chronological age, but then in the replicative aging experiments, siDAP is lost quickly. Discussion ‘ There is some evidence to suggest that cellular surveillance systems that usually keep protein aggregation in check deteriorate during aging…. ’ - There may be some conflation of biological aging and ""replicative aging"".  There seemed to be conflicting results when looking at differently biologically aged samples, which may affect interpretation of whether replicative aging in a dish recapitulates aging processes. Methods Cell culture - Please provide further information about the age and other details for the 6 primary fibroblast cell lines.

Review synthesized by Bianca Trovò. Antibody-based technologies for the detection and quantification of analytes in complex biological samples present challenges regarding the infrastructure and chemical modifications involved. There is therefore interest in developing alternative biosensor platforms that leverage split luciferase enzymes. Single-component luminescent biosensors can be more easily produced and work in both homogenous and immobilized assay formats. The manuscript reports the design of BAT, a single-component, NanoLuc-based, Binding Activated Tandem split enzyme biosensor for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in multiple assay formats. The reviewers praised the efficiency and practical value of the reporter system described, as the reporter protein works even in crude bacterial cell lysate, as well as the novelty of the mechanism of action for the reporter system. A few comments and suggestions raised are outlined below. Major comments - In the introduction, the manuscript mentions the single-component, NanoLuc-based, Binding Activated Tandem split enzyme (BAT) biosensor, which is said to “ not rely on a large conformational change in the binding module or competition with a tethered decoy as with other single component platforms ”. The manuscript argues for the uniqueness and generality of the BAT approach based on a mechanism that does not rely on conformational change. Further references and explanation for the mode of action would be helpful to support the argument. Given the lack of conformational change in the binding module, can an explanation be included for what causes the split components to come closer and reconstitute again? - Results, Design and optimization of SARS-CoV-2 biosensor “S-BAT”: the explanation of Figure 1a and Figure S1f provided in the context of the model for the mechanism of BATs could be strengthened with crystal diffraction data to validate the hypothesis, especially for clarifying how steric hindrance occurs when binding with the antigen (although this will not elucidate any conformational change happening in LCB1 upon binding). - Results, Design and optimization of SARS-CoV-2 biosensor “S-BAT”: the manuscript reports a full mutational analysis, or deep mutational scanning (DMS) leading to the generation of “ a point mutant in the S-BAT binding module at Asp30 (“S-BAT*”), designed to ablate salt bridges formed with Lys417 and Arg403 in the Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) ”. Would it be possible to have this mutation motivated in the manuscript, and why was it chosen over other possible mutations in that context? - Results, Design and optimization of SARS-CoV-2 biosensor “S-BAT”: the statement that “the absence of a hook effect at super-stoichiometric concentrations of Spike binding sites to sensor copies supports a predominantly cis activation mechanism ” is a strong point but further clarification on this point is recommended, for example, further context on the Hook effect, and what would have been expected if trans activation was the major mode of action. - Discussion: the manuscript has shown different versions of the same assay, so a discussion on advantages of one version over the other would be important. Minor comments - Results, Design and optimization of SARS-CoV-2 biosensor “ S-BAT”: “In addition to having high thermal stability, rigidity, and no disulfide bonds to complicate purification ” - Please clarify which protein these qualities refer to. - Results, Design and optimization of SARS-CoV-2 biosensor “S-BAT”: “ This suggests that cis activation is likely the predominant source of signal in the assay, but we cannot rule out the contribution of a trans activating mechanism. In the trans mechanism, simultaneous binding to multiple protomers in a single Spike might increase the effective concentration, driving activation. ” - Please provide further comments on the cis and trans mechanisms. - Results, S-BAT is functional in multiple assay formats: “ Adsorption-based immobilization is advantageous in that it requires no chemical modification to the protein reagent ”, recommend reporting the efficiency of this step and how much signal is left after the washing steps. - Methods, Cloning: the manuscript reports that all BAT constructs were subcloned using NcoI and BamHI restriction sites via Gibson assembly. Restriction site cloning and Gibson assembly seem to be two orthogonal methods, suggest providing further information on the cloning procedure. - Methods, Recombinant Protein Production: "" The un-cleaved BAT sensors were concentrated to ∼1.0 mL, and the concentration was calculated from the A280 value ”. It is unclear if this was done using highly pure imidazole or if the signal was subtracted from Imidazole? A280 quantification is known to be difficult with Imidazole present. - In Figure 1c: “ Performance (Signal to Noise (S/N) multiplied by the magnitude of signal change (S-N)) ” please provide the mathematical expression for this analysis",2022-07-29T11:32:47,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2022.06.15.496006,A single-component luminescent biosensor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"Matthew Ravalin, Heegwang Roh, Rahul Suryawanshi, G.

It would be interesting to compare them but it seems to me, there is not significant difference in the infection of the TTMV-Ly1, Ly2, Ly3 viral particles (Figure 45). I looked at the TTMV-Ly2 because it has two characteristic repeats in the 5’-noncoding region, the second repeat was probably created by the insertion of about 66nts (insert: gccggaaaaccacataatttgcatggctaaccacaaactgatatgctaattaacttccacaaaaca).

I especially like Figure 3 where the authors compare the severity of partial knock down of SEPTIN9 with siRNA vs in the knock-out CRISPR cell line. The complete lack of cilia in Figure 3J/K is very striking. The experiments using centrin-fused RhoA and ARHGEF18 are very creative. It is impressive how long the cilia are in Figure 5D! I find it interesting that expressing the Centrin-GFP-DHPH construct doesn’t cause the same long cilia phenotype in the Septin9 KO cells. This observation is based on the images shown in the panels because I do not see cilia length measured in Septin9KO + Centrin-GFP-DHPH. I appreciate the use of scatter plots to highlight the variability/reproducibility of the data. I assume the different colors relate to different replicates, but this is not clearly stated. I have a few specific comments with regards to Figure 7: I found it difficult to see the 3 RPGRIP1L puncta. I think if the panels were more zoomed in or larger it would help to better highlight the shift from 3 to 2 puncta in the Septin9 KO cells. In the Septin9 KO cells RPGRIP1L and TCTN2 staining was not observed at the transition zone. This observation is not surprising since the Septin9 KO cells do not have cilia (Figure 3J/K). As such, I do not believe that the conclusion that Septin9 “mediates the localization of transition zone components to the ciliary base” is founded. Septin9 could have a function early in ciliogenesis that is not necessarily specific to mediating the localization of transition zone components. Perhaps this could be better resolved in the Septin9 siRNA knock down where short cilia are present. The data showing that expression of constitutively active RhoA restores RPGRIP1L and TCTN2 at the transition zone (7I,7J,7M,7N) is very nice and consistent with this construct restoring cilia in the Septin9 KO. However, I think the data in 7M and 7N would be clearer if you included the Sept9 KO data on this graph. One last point – Figures 7A, 7B, and the inset on 7C state RPGRIP1 while the text only refers to RPGRIP1L. The Materials and Methods do not mention which antibody was used so I am not clear which protein was the focus of this study.

Using the BH3 swap mutants is nice, but does not tell you much about the activity of the full-length (endogenous) protein. You may be aware that the ""BH3-only"" version of BCL-G is barely expressed in most cells and the version with BH2 & BH3 domain is much more abundant (PMID_23059823). So, studying the BH3 domain in isolation appears somewhat artificial to me. Also, in the CT26 xenotransplant experiment you show would benefit from overexpressing a BH3_mut version of BNIP5 and some data that documents it is really impaired BAK-dependent cell death that gives the growth advantage.....there could be many alternative explanations. So, comparing CT26 lacking Bax or Bak ± BNIP5 wt vs. mut would be a strong experiment to test your hypotheses.  Happy to chat more.....",2022-07-26T16:45:31,,Andy Villunger,10.1101/2022.07.24.499430,Anti-apoptotic BH3-only proteins inhibit Bak-dependent apoptosis,"Sebastian Ruehl, Clifford S.

The manuscript reports an increase in pHi at the G2/M transition, decreased pHi at the G1/S boundary, S/G2 boundary, and prior to division, and increases during mid-S phase and G2, and suggests that pHi dynamics are necessary for cell cycle progression. The reviewers praised the topic of the study, measuring intracellular pH during the cell cycle and looking at the heterogeneity between cells are both important questions. However, there were some  questions raised about the methodology as well as the interpretation of the data, as outlined below. Comments about methodology The pH sensor used in the study has been used previously but the single-cell level use requires new types of control and validations. It would be relevant to report: - What is the measurement error? - How efficient is the permeabilization protocol? - How homogeneous is the expression of the sensor? How does the expression level impact the pHi readout? These technical parameters could explain the heterogeneity in pHi reported in Figures 1,2,3, and they are relevant to understand if the fluctuations reported are relevant biologically or at the level of technical variability. Recommend providing additional details on the methodology for single cell pHi measurements, to ensure the experiments can be fully reproduced. Please report sample sizes. There is apparent intra-cellular heterogeneity present within each cell. The text should highlight whether the cytoplasm is heterogenous in pH. The study uses a single ROI per cell to measure intracellular pHi, however, if the cytoplasm is heterogeneous as some images show, the location of the ROI can influence the readout. It is recommended to use image analysis tools to segment cells and use the whole signal rather than a selected portion. There are concerns about the statistical analysis for several figures (including Figs 2I, 3I, and 5), in particular regarding the calculation of p-values based on multiple measurements or cells within each sample. The t-test and ANOVA assume that each measurement is independent, while multiple nuclei within the same sample are not independent. Recommend not reporting p-values or averaging together the values from each sample and then calculate the p-value using those sample-level means. For more information, see https://doi.org/10.1371/jou... and https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb... The median is used as the reporter of the populations, the context for this choice is unclear. There are concerns about reporting standard deviation to estimate the spread around the median. Specific comments Introduction ‘In normal cells, intracellular pH (pHi) is near neutral (∼7.2)... ’ - Could the text specify the type of cells the statement relates to, does it apply to all eukaryotes, mammalian cells, or even more specific and only demonstrated for human cells? Results ‘ single-cell standardization is performed using buffers of known pH containing the protonophore nigericin (Fig. 1A, see methods for details). ’ - The experiments use two pH extremes (~6.7 and 7.7 per the Materials & Methods)) and assume a linear relationship of the emission ratio between these extremes. Is this linear relationship verified? The supplementary Fig S2. shows an increase in signal across just two points. Suggest presenting an analysis of the biosensor across 4-5 different pH points to demonstrate linearity and dynamic range within the first set of figures. Plotting the ratio as well as the fluorescence intensities of individual channels across these pH ranges would also be relevant. Figure 1 - Is there an explanation for the signal from the nucleus? It seems initially more acidic than the cytoplasm and then it does not change as much as the cytoplasm during the nigericin treatment. Is this due to bad permeabilization? - ‘ B) NL20, C) A549, and D) H1299’ - Please indicate which cells are normal and which cancerous. - ‘ E-G) Histograms of single-cell pHi in E) NL20 (n=173, 3 biological replicates), F) A549 (n=424, 4 biological replicates), and G) H1299 (n=315, 3 biological replicates). ’ - The distributions are aggregates of 3 or 4 biological replicates. What do the distributions look like in each replicate? Are the differences between conditions visible? If the E, F and G histograms are generated using data pooled from different replicates, recommend separating the replicates and presenting the distributions separately for each replicate experiment. ‘ We next measured single-cell pHi in individual NL20-mCh-pHl (Fig. 1B), A549-mCh-pHl (Fig. 1C), and H1299-mCh-pHl (Fig. 1D) cells ’ - From the methods: ""Individual Regions of Interest (ROI) are drawn for each cell in each condition (initial, high pH nigericin, and low pH nigericin), and mCherry aggregates are removed using thresholding holes."" From the cells in the image, it appears that the cytoplasmic signal is not homogenous and suggests that the choice of ROI will affect the reading for each cell. In this condition, to do single cell measurements, it is recommended to use the signal from the entire cell (cytoplasm) rather than using an ROI. ‘ Representative pHluorin and mCherry channels and single-cell standardization lines can be found in Fig. S2 ’ - The pH probe appears to be comprised of a straight fusion between the pH sensitive GFP (pHluorin) and pH insensitive mCherry. One would expect that the ratio of GFP to mCherry is only determined by pH (and not by expression level or excitation intensity). A question arises around the dynamic range (shown in fig. S2) being different between the different cell lines. For instance, the ratios observed for pH=7 and pH=7.8 are 3 and 8 for NL20, 3 and 5 for A549, and 0.5 and 2 for H1299. Can an explanation be provided  for the differences between cell lines? Were the single cell measurements verified with a dye (BCECF/SNARF/SNAFL)? Was the permeabilization protocol validated? ‘ (NL20-mCh-pHl) (Fig. 1E; 7.42±0.07). ’ - The first sentence of the results section indicates ""In normal epithelial cells, pHi is near neutral (∼7.2), while cancer cells have a constitutively increased pHi (pHi>7.4)."" According to this statement, the NL20 cell line has a pHi corresponding to cancer cells, can this be clarified? ‘ These data show the advantages of measuring single-cell pHi under physiological culture conditions that match population averages, but also provide pHi distributions lost at the population level. ’ - The single cell data reveal the heterogeneity, can further explanation be provided for the advantage gained by these data over bulk measurements? ‘ These data also show that pHi is heterogeneous even in clonal, genetically identical, cell lines, suggesting pHi may be a biomarker for non-genetic cell phenotype ’ - The data show heterogeneity, but do not address how much and what the source of heterogeneity is. It would be helpful to: report the error on the measurement, compare the spread of pHi to something else to get a sense of the normal level of noise in the measurement. Could this be compared to the spread of mCherry intensity, to check if there is more spread in pHi than in expression level of the construct. Independent measurement of the heterogeneity of the pH (e.g. with another probe/dye) would shed some light. The heterogeneity (or spread) of basal biosensor distributions could be compared against the distributions achieved after nigericin treatment - to bring out the differences in biological heterogeneity versus measurement error.  The results could then further elaborate on whether the biological heterogeneity has relevance in the regulation of cellular processes. ‘ pHi in physiological environments ’ - Can some clarification be provided for how prior studies did not follow physiological conditions, while the current set up would provide such physiological conditions? ‘ We synchronized H1299-mCh-pHl cells using Palbociclib’ - The study uses H1299 line in most figures hereafter, A549 line in some while not the NL-20 lung cells, can some justification be provided for the selection of cell lines for specific experiments. ‘ In this representative replicate, we observed single-cell pHi significantly decreased between 0 and 4 h, significantly increased between 4 and 8 h, decreased between 8 and 12 h, and increased again between 12 and 24 h (Fig. 2D).’ - It is not clear whether these data are consistent with the other replicates (Figure S3). For example, another replicate shows a consistent decrease of pHi between 0-4h and 4-8h, which is not the case for the example shown in the main figure. Can some clarification be added about discrepancies between replicates. In Figure S3 the different time points were statistically compared to their previous time point, can the same statistical analysis be applied to the replicate in Figure 2? Figure 2 ‘Box and whisker plots of F) cyclin E1, G) cyclin A2, and H) cyclin B1 immunoblot data across 3 biological replicates’ - There is a concern about the use of boxplots for n=3 as they summarize the data into 5 statistics (2x whiskers, Q1, Q3 and the median): www.nature.com/articles/nme.... It is recommended to show the individual data with a dotplot. ‘ Figure 2I. Violin plots of raw pHi across 3 biological replicates ’ - A superplot is recommended for identifying the biological vs. technical replicates: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.... The significance should be determined based on n=3 (not on the pooled technical replicates). ‘ Cyclin immunoblots and pHi agreed across 3 biological replicates, and additional blots are shown in Fig. S3.’ -The replicates from Fig. S3 and Fig. 2 do not appear to show a clear behavior. For example at 4h, two replicates show a decrease while the third shows an increase in pHi. Could some clarification be added for this? ‘ When pHi measurements on Palbociclib-treated cells were compared over three biological replicates, we found that pHi significantly decreased at the G1/S transition (4 h, 7.75±0.15) and in late S phase (12 h, 7.69±0.09), significantly increased at G2/M (24 h, 7.82±0.11) (Fig. 2I), and then significantly decreased once more at the end of the experiment in asynchronous cells (36 h, 7.67±0.10) (Fig. 2I). ’ - The population in Fig 1 shows a large spread from around 7.4 to 8. This emcopasses all the distribution shown in Fig 2 and if the individual time points are undersampled, small fluctuations are expected in the mean and the median. Can some comment be provided about the potential influence of undersampling on the fluctuation? If the fluctuations were due to undersampling they would be random and could explain why the replicates are not in very good agreement. Also, can some clarification be added about how many cells were measured in each time point. Figure 3 - The various replicates provided here and in Sup. Fig. 4 show variability. For example, only the replicate in the main figure shows a decrease at 4h and 12h. The third and fourth replicates are in good agreement and for those pHi stays roughly the same and then drops between 12h and 24h. Should this be reflected in the text? From the values on the y axis for each time point and replicate, it seems that the sample size varies between replicates. There is the risk of undersampling, and also that if one replicate contains much more cells than others, it would dominate the distributions once the data are pulled together. Can the sample size for each time point and replicates be reported? ‘ and decreases at 12 h and 24 h (Fig. S5B-C) ’ - The text previously reported that pHi increased between 12 and 24h for H1299 cells, here it reports that there is a decrease at 24h. Please provide a clarification. ‘ we established a time-lapse approach to track pHi dynamics over an entire cell cycle in a single cell. ’ - This is a robust approach to detect pH changes over time. ‘w e selected prophase as a “normalization point” for each individual dividing cell ’ - Recommend referring to ""synchronization point"" instead of ‘normalization’. Figure 4 The paper shows that synchronization alters baseline pHi. Could a similar experiment be completed without synchronization? ‘A) Representative stills of Video S1 of a dividing H1299-mCh-pHl cell at indicated time (h) ’ - It would be good to compare this to the metastatic cells used to establish how much of the pHi fluctuations observed during the cell cycle are ""cancer"" related. ‘ Furthermore, the pHluorin increases observed over time in dividing cells are not correlated with increased mCherry fluorescence, which indicates pHluorin increases are not due to increases in biosensor expression (Fig. S8B-C).’ - It is great that this measurement was completed. However, from the plots provided Sup. Fig. 8 B and C, in dividers and non-dividers, it looks like the two signals (mCh intensity and pHluorin) are well correlated (first a decrease for a few hours, then it rises until 10h then it decreases). Could this indicate that the readout is influenced by protein concentration / expression? Suggest plotting the two signals vs each other’s on a scatter plot and formally testing for correlation. Figure 5 For the FUCCI reporter, plotting mVenus and mCherry intensities normalized between the max and min value for each cell allows clear identification of transition between phases. It may be helpful to present example single cell traces from 5-10 cells for each treatment, to more clearly appreciate the cell cycle phase transitions and their durations on panels F,G and H. ‘D) Single-cell pHi of H1299-FUCCI cells treated with EIPA and SO859 (E+S, n=233) to lower pHi, untreated (CRL, n=267), or treated with ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, n=202) to raise pHi (see methods for details) ‘ - Please clarify how or when delta pHi was calculated for data in Fig. 5D. ‘ previous work in lower- order organisms ’ - ""lower-order"" has a negative connotation, please consider re-phrasing to include the species or at least family of organisms. Discussion - Recommend further discussion about altered progression through cell cycle phases at different pHi and how it could be altered in cancer cells. Is increased intracellular pH in cancer cells related in any way to their increased proliferation? If so, which cell cycle steps are affected? High intracellular pH seems to elongate all phases except the M phase. Methods ‘ Multiple Z-planes were collected with the center focal plane maintained using a Perfect Focus System (PFS). ’ - Please report whether pH was analyzed on a projection, a single z-slice, each z-slice? Single-cell pHi measurements - Please provide additional detail for the protocol for the single cell pHi measurement. Include information on whether the work involves single image, stacks, projections, etc, and the size and location of the ROIs. Please also provide further context for the ""mCherry aggregates"", does this mean the construct is cleaved and the mCh aggregate? Does the GFP aggregate too? NIS Analysis Software//GraphPad Prism - Please report the version of the software used. ‘ Individual Regions of Interest (ROI) are drawn for each cell in each condition’ - Could the ROI on a few of the cells be drawn and highlighted in the main figures to show the size and location of the ROI? ‘8% laser power for GFP; 700 ms exposure time and 10% laser power for TxRed; and 100 ms exposure time and 5% laser power DAPI’ - Please report the exact wavelengths used to excite the fluorophore, (e.g. 8% power of a 488 laser (GFP excitation)). Supplementary figures Figure S3 panel A - Should the calibration slope be the same for every cell? Can some explanation be provided for why some cells have a steeper slope than others? Figure S4 - Replicates appear to show different trends in pHi and Cyclins, which makes it difficult to interpret the data. Figure S8 panel A - This plot shows correlation between the two quantities, they both rise and fall at the same time.
