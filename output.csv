https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.11.475783v1#comment-5789296069,biorxivstage,2,"The manuscript by Cuitun-Coronado et al. investigates the effects of circadian and diel cycles on the photosynthetic processes of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. The authors clarified three points: 1) they confirmed that M. polymorpha does display circadian regulation of several photosynthetic parameters; 2) they showed that light-dark cycles mask circadian cycles for these parameters; 3) by using a pharmacological approach, they showed that chloroplast translation is necessary for the circadian regulation of photosynthesis. The study fills a gap of knowledge in the circadian regulation of photosynthetic activity across evolution, by providing an additional link to what was known in cyanobacteria, microalgae, and vascular plants. It is original and  well-conducted. The interpretation and the discussion of the results is very convincing, and the conclusions are carefully drawn and backed up by the data. Major comments -	Page 7, lines 173-176: it is stated that the differences in period length observed between PAM and DF measurements might be due to differences in light intensity. How about light quality, as the PAM measurements were performed under blue light, vs. mixed red/blue for DF? -	Blue light, which was used in both types of experiments, has been shown to impact circadian rhythms in plants through the action of cryptochromes (e.g. Chaves et al., Annu. Rev. Plant Biol., 2011). Also, BL is responsible for chloroplast relocation responses, which is mediated by phototropins (e.g. see Kong et al. Plant and Cell Physiology, 2013). In Arabidopsis it can also impact plastid transcription through the intermediate of the blue-responsive plastid sigma factor SIG5 (Tsunoyama et al, FEBS Lett. 2002) and it is regulated by BL photoreceptors cryptochromes (Onda 2007, Plant Journal). Can you comment on these potential effects? Has their involvement in Marchantia polymorpha been investigated? Did they motivate your use of blue light for these experiments? -	Page 13, lines 316-323, please discuss the lack of effect on circadian rhythm by rifampicin: at first it may appear odd that translation has an effect but transcription doesn’t. Could it be due to rifampicin only inhibiting PEP and transcription by NEP compensates? -	Page 14, lines 354-363: 1)	Is there a reason why you performed light curves with increasing light intensity up to 789 µmol m-2 s-1 if you end up using only the data with light intensity closer to growth conditions (108 µmol m-2 s-1)? 2)	Could the 20 minutes of dark-adaptation every two hours and increasing light intensity up to 789 µmol m-2 s-1 have affected the circadian rhythms of plants that were supposed to be at constant LL? This experimental setup could be considered as fluctuating light condition. Please discuss whether this may have an effect on the observed results. Minor comments -	Page 2, lines 27-28, ""the circadian regulation of several measures of photosynthetic biochemistry (delayed fluorescence, the rate of photosynthetic electron transport, and non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence)"": please rephrase this sentence as it seems that the circadian regulation has an effect on the measurements themselves while they are tools to see something happening at photosynthetic levels. We suggest replacing it with ""circadian regulation affects photosynthesis performances, detectable by several photosynthetic parameters such as delayed fluorescence, the rate of photosynthetic electron transport, and non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence"". Same can be applied in Pages 4-5, lines 98-99. -	Page 4, lines 84-90, this sentence is very long and difficult to read, please rephrase and split it into at least two sentences for better readability and clarity. -	Page 5, lines 114-118, discussion might be a better place for this. -	Page 5, line 118, please replace ""Features of PAM fluorescence"" with ""Features of chlorophyll fluorescence as measured by PAM"" as the first indicates a specific method to measure an intrinsic phenomena (Chl fluo) and it is not the only one for Chl fluo measurements. -	Page 5, line 123, please replace ""PAM metrics"" with ""prompt fluorescence"" for consistency with DF, named just before. -	Page 6, lines 126-127, to be consistent with the nomenclature, ""LL"" should be ""low light"", not ""constant light"". Consider replacing LL with CLL (""constant low light"") since the plants are actually exposed to a lower light compared to the standard growth light described in materials and methods. Also, please include in the description of the light conditions “LD” together with its full name (which is directly mentioned before in line 138 without its full name ""light-dark cycles""). -	Pages 6-7, lines 152-154, this sentence is more technical and it does not seem necessary to understand and interpret the results described later. Please consider moving this sentence in Material and methods to keep the results section more readable. -	Page 7, lines 167-172, please provide a reason why photosynthetic activity was measured only under LL and not also in the other two conditions described for DF. -	Page 8, lines 196-199, reading the text it seems you used only T24 and T28. Please list all the T lengths (T20, T22, T24 and T28) as reported in Figure 3 legend. -	Page 10, line 254, please add a short sentence to briefly comment the results obtained with the rifampicin treatment. -	Page 13, lines 316-318, ""Perhaps inhibiting the expression of these proteins prevents or reduces PSII repair, which disrupts circadian cycles of the rate of electron transport by interfering with the electron transport process"". Please rephrase this sentence, as it is written it can be interpreted as defective PSII repair disrupts circadian cycles. -	Page 13, line 335, describe conditions of its natural habitat “such as”. -	Page 14, lines 341, in the growth conditions you describe that the standard light conditions used were 100 μmol photons m-2 s-1 of white light. Is there a reason why for the DF experiment described in this manuscript you decided to use 60 µmol m-2 s-1? -	Page 18, legend of Figure 1: line 421, “thallus” should be “thalli”; “light/cycles” should read “light/dark cycles”. -	Line 430, define FFT-NLLS. -	Please move the definition of RAE from lines 433-434, to its first occurrence line 430. -	Line 433, define SEM. -	Page 19, line 470, please write SEM instead of s.e.m., for consistency with the legend of Figure 1. -	Figure 1: the figure is very big and can create confusion, please consider to split it in two figures, e.g. a-f Figure1 and g-k Figure 2. -	In the legend, include the abbreviations for the light conditions and correct ""ligh/cycles"" with ""light-dark cycles"" as reported in the text. -	Panel g. Please better describe this panel, especially the colours meaning in the clock. -	Figure 1 (a,c,e) 2 and Figure 4: the alternance of white and light grey bands to mark the 12h periods can be very easily misinterpreted as light/dark cycles. To clarify and display the constant light conditions at a glance, please consider using another means to evidence them, such as dashed lines. -	Figure 4: similarly to Figure 1, this figure is very large and hard to read. Consider splitting it. -	Please write the concentrations of lincomycin and rifampicin in the relevant panels, as the different shades are difficult to distinguish and understand in panels a-d, g-j, m-p and s-v. -	Panels f-l and r-x: please use the same scale on the y axis, or, if not possible, bring attention of the reader to the different scale in the figure legend. At first, we were puzzled by the ‘no-treatment’ not starting from similar amplitudes.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.15.480607v1#comment-5781173513,biorxivstage,1,"We have some technical and theoretical concerns about the experiments. Hopefully our comments will help the authors to improve their manuscript and clarify the issue for the readers. There are some methodological issues that could be important in the interpretation of their results. Because the authors used wide-field imaging with one-photon excitation, which results in PSFs that are likely several times larger than the size of a spine (after tissue scattering), it is likely that the spine signals were contaminated by dendritic ones and by out of focus contributions. Also, since the experiments were performed in brain slices, and near the cut surface of the tissue, the studied spines may not have been in a physiological state. Moreover, the repeated patching of the neurons could lead to cellular damage, and the long periods of whole cell dialysis and high light exposure add serious risk of incident photo damage, affecting neuron’s biophysical properties. Indeed, dendritic beading, a classic sign of tissue damage already described by Cajal, is evident in most of their images. Also, although glutamate uncaging has been broadly validated by many groups, including our own, it is still not equivalent to the response of spines when synaptically activated in a physiological state, which could involve different set of receptors, conductances, inhibitory signals, etc.. With respect to the criticisms they raise about our recently published work (Cornejo et al, 2021), aside from major experimental differences in species (rat vs. mouse) and age (developing vs. adult animals) and without dwelling in the details of the analysis, we would simply encourage the authors to view our movies of voltage imaging of dendrites in vivo. In these movies, included as supplementary material in our recent paper ( https://www.science.org/sto..., one can directly see with one’s own eyes how individual spines are often activated in the absence of any significant depolarization in the dendrites. Also, while the authors suggest that the voltage compartmentalization could be an artifact of the slow sampling, in fact, the known frequency-depending filtering of electrical signals would predict the opposite. Finally, we would note that the authors own data (Fig. 1, for example) confirms the large amplitude of spine potentials made in our recent paper and in the intracellular recordings of Jayant et al. 2016, which they criticize. It is important to mention that many previous experimental or calculated explorations of spine voltage compartmentalization (Harnett et al., 2012; Tonnesen et al., 2014; Jayant at al., 2017; Kwon et al., 2017; Cornejo et al., 2022), have revealed a significant heterogeneity in spine responses. Indeed, even disregarding the technical issues mentioned above, inspections of the authors’ own data, for example Figure 1D (or in Popovic at al., 2015), demonstrates that a significant number of spines are compartmentalizing voltage to a similar extent than what we have measured in vivo. The authors ignore these data points and the heterogeneity that their results reveal. Given this, and the methodological problems of their approach, we would encourage the authors to soften their tone in their one-sided conclusions and do justice to their own data. We are looking forward to constructively conciliate different experiments and interpretations in order to better understand together spine physiology and biophysics.",2022-03-07T15:26:54,,Rafael Yuste,10.1101/2022.02.15.480607,Contribution of individual excitatory synapses on dendritic spines to electrical signalling,"Ju-Yun Weng, Cesar Ceballos, Dejan Zecevic",2022-02-17

The goal of this pipeline is to be able to generate structural models of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants in complex with existing therapeutics (nanobodies, antibodies, etc) and (re)design antibodies to maintain or improve antibody binding interactions. The authors initially develop a set of computed structural models (CSMs - an acronym/term that we find unnecessary and confusing, wouldn’t “model” suffice?) of Omicron Spike protein bound to ACE2 and therapeutic entities using experimentally-determined structures optimized by Rosetta FastRelax or predicted structures from AlphaFold2. The major confusion we have with this paper is the utility of generating predicted structures from AlphaFold2 when there are numerous experimentally-determined structures available on the PDB as starting models for mutagenesis and Rosetta optimization. The justification for using AF2 is not outlined clearly in the manuscript, and the data do not suggest that AF2 provides any obvious benefits over using Rosetta alone. The majority of the paper uses a consensus approach to score predictions based on different procedures. However, we could see a compelling argument for using AF2 in future VOC (or new viruses) that are even more diverged than Omicron. If this is the type of future application the authors imagine, presenting consensus scores as the sum of scores instead of the individual scores for each procedure undermines the potential comparative utility of having both experimental and predicted models in this analysis (a potential strength of the manuscript). The major limitation of this study is that it is purely computational and while the anecdotal evidence that certain clinically relevant antibodies retain (or lose) effectiveness against Omicron is a good validation, the rescue mutant studies will likely have little resonance with the community until validated experimentally. Perhaps there is a greater argument to be made based on some of the deep mutational scanning data that is emerging. The presentation of energetic changes as either “stabilizing” or “destabilizing” without accompanying quantitative values or calibration to experiment obscures the magnitude of de/stabilization caused by each amino acid substitution. Overall, this manuscript is an interesting exploration of how researchers can utilize computational structural biology to (re)design therapeutics in real-time to address the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The manuscript would benefit from providing stronger justification of why predicted structures can be essential for understanding how host-pathogen protein:protein interfaces evolve in an evolving pandemic - and from learning how to make those predictions stronger. Major Points 1. The justification for generating CSMs with and without position coordinate restraints should be explained. 2. Consensus Scoring currently obscures the Rosetta Energy Unit value for each CSM and does not help the reader better understand why 4 CSMs are needed to accomplish the outlined goal of the paper. 3. Is it conceivable that the degree of (de)stabilization is related to the magnitude of the REU value, i.e. 1.4 REU vs 3 REU? 4. L309-311: Citation 26 proposes that Omicron may have developed into immunosuppressed chronically infected COVID-19 patients, but this is a hypothesis and not currently supported by data. I would remove this statement or cite primary literature supporting this claim such as Kemp, S.A., Collier, D.A., Datir, R.P. et al. SARS-CoV-2 evolution during treatment of chronic infection. Nature 592, 277–282 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41.... 5. Figure 2A: why is the cryoEM structure overlaid with the predicted structure? The structures look nearly identical, so unclear what this representation adds. If positional differences between experimental and predicted structure is important, color residues in AF2 structure by RMSD. 6. Figure 2B-C: if you’re trying to highlight changes in the extensive interaction network between WT and Omicron, show as an overlay. 7. Figure 3: this figure does not make sense. 8. Figure 2, 4-10: Represent WT and Omicron comparisons as an overlay in one panel instead of two structures in side by side panels. This will be easier for reader to visualize the differences. Minor Points 1. Refer to Wuhan-Hu-1 as WT, by NCBI number, or other identifier that does not use the city name, so as to reduce stigma. 2. L121: The definition of “cocktail” as “two or more bound proteins in a single multi-protein complex.” The term “multi-protein” implies two or more proteins, either protomers of the same protein or monomers of different proteins. Suggested edits would be “two or more proteins bound to an oligomeric protein complex (ACE2 trimer).” 3. L132: Define pLDDT earlier than line 136. 4. L152-154: Why were N- and C-termini included in both experimental and predicted models if they are not necessary and will skew the overall Calpha RMSD? 5. L251-252: Recommend adding a figure/table showing sequence consensus between Omicron and other variants only for AA sites mutated in Omicron 6. Figure 2A: In the inset, it is unclear why Res 387-389 are annotated if the authors want to focus on Res 364-376. I would show the full residue range 364-376 as sidechains and label each residue. It seems that there are additional residues 477-478 shown as sidechains in the full image to represent mutations found in omRBD. This is unclear from the text and figure legend. I recommend removing the inset. 7. If using a yellow-to-green spectrum coloring scheme, include a scale bar on the image. Also, yellow to green is a difficult color spectrum to visually interpret, and this is made more difficult given that the backbone is colored green.

For now, a few comments: + In Fig. 1, the two peaks that merge into one come very clearly from two independent nucleation events. Eventually, the two clusters merge. + In the case of GSY at the lowest concentration (Fig. 2), there certainly is diffusion of the condensate from left to right of the box, even if part of the effect in the figure may be due the COM-centering in the density calculation.  At the lowest concentrations there is barely enough ""protein"" for spanning the box from side to side and hence the condensate is more droplet-like. I think it makes sense that the condensate diffuses more easily than when the slab is thicker and comfortably spans the simulation box. + With respect to the single or multiple nucleation spots (e.g. GSY 2 M), I haven't yet looked at critical number of particles, but from my many simulations, I can say different things will happen in different runs.

Quick question, when we see in figure 1 the formation of two smaller clusters before emerging a larger and single one, can we say these are initial LLPS formation steps or two well-formed smaller condensates that fuse into a bigger one? It's interesting to see in figure 2 that lower concentration GSY condensates diffuse from left to right in the box, while higher concentration condensates remain fixed (don't diffuse) once formed. Is this an MD artefact, or does it represent larger bodies' diffusion hindrance? Also, in figure 2 B), for 2M concentrations, we see forming two initial condensation spots (dark blue). In contrast, this is not so visible for other concentrations, and the system seems to transit straight to a single cluster. Is there a concentration lower and upper limit to form these initial smaller clusters? Have you found this behaviour to depend much on the initial seed number? It does depend on the force-field, as seen in FigS1. Minor typos. fig 4: y-axis legend of panel C - missing ( figS1 - have the starting colours be a bit darker.

Previous work has shown that the transcription factors QstR and TfoY are key regulators of the V. cholerae T6SS in a pandemic strain, but the authors demonstrate constitutive expression and activity of the T6SS in other V. cholerae strains that have a single SNP in the intergenic region upstream of the T6SS genes. This work has important implications for how T6SS expression has evolved in different V. cholerae lineages, and the conditions under which the T6SS is active in different strains. More broadly, the paper demonstrates that a single SNP in an intergenic region can dramatically affect gene expression. The data are of high quality throughout the paper, and the use of complementary assays of T6SS activity and expression provides independent assessment of T6SS regulation. The major conclusion of the paper is that a T at position -68 is associated with strong expression/activity of the T6SS, whereas a G at -68 has much lower T6SS expression/activity unless qstR is overexpressed. This conclusion is well supported by the data. However, the authors also argue that having a T at position -68 makes T6SS expression independent of QstR, but they do not test this. It may simply be that a T at -68 leads to overall higher expression of T6SS genes that could be further boosted by overexpression of qstR. Whether or not T6SS expression is affected by QstR in strains with -68T has important implications for the mechanism by which position -68 influences T6SS expression. Major Comments: 1. The authors claim in several places that the base identity at position -68 determines whether or not T6SS expression is activated by QstR. However, the authors do not test whether overexpression of qstR (i.e., the qstR * strain) impacts expression of T6SS genes in strains with a T at -68. For some strains, expression may already be so high that any effect of qstR overexpression will be difficult to see, but that is likely not the case for strains VC22, 2479-86, and 2512-86. The authors should test the effect of overexpression of qstR on T6SS expression or activity in one or more of these strains. 2. The paper implies that QstR expression is induced by chitin. This connection should be more clearly explained. If QstR expression is indeed induced by chitin, an important additional experiment would be to show that chitin promotes T6SS expression/activity in C6706, and that this effect is reduced in a Δ qstR strain. Minor Comments: 1. We recommend quantifying the data shown in Figure 1G and moving this to the supplement. Alternatively, Figure 1G could be removed from the paper since it is largely redundant with Figure 1C. 2. It would be helpful to modify Figure 3A to include the phylogenetic tree from Figure S3. 3. Position -68 is sometimes referred to as -388, presumably reflecting the position relative to the start codon of the first gene in the operon. We recommend using “-68” throughout. 4. One of the data points in Figure 2B/C is labeled as “IGRV52”. While this is correctly labeled, we suggest changing the label to “G-68T”, as this makes the figure easier to interpret and easier to compare to Figure 2D/E. 5. There are published ChIP-seq data for QstR. It would be informative to briefly discuss where QstR binds relative to position -68. This could be indicated in Figure 2A. 6. The discussion is very brief. We encourage the authors to elaborate on (i) possible mechanisms by which the SNP at position -68 alters T6SS expression, and (ii) possible selective pressures associated with the SNP at -68 for the different V. cholerae strains. 7. A figure at the end of the paper showing a model for the two types of regulation would be helpful for readers. This schematic could include what we already know about the roles of TfoX, TfoY, and QstR in T6SS regulation.",2022-02-28T21:28:13,disqus_y9FR6hyg5J,Joseph Wade,10.1101/2022.01.11.475911,Evolution of a cis-acting SNP that controls Type VI Secretion in Vibrio cholerae,"Siu Lung Ng, Sophia Kammann, Gabi Steinbach, Tobias Hoffmann, Peter J Yunker, Brian K.

Together with the functional data, the new structures described in this preprint greatly contribute to a better understanding of neuromedin U receptors (NMURs) and potentially related peptide-binding GPCRs. Here, I add a short, constructive comment regarding one of the NMURs’ related peptide-binding GPCRs, i.e., the neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1). In wild-type NTSR1, residue 3.33 is Asp, not Glu. Therefore, the labeling of residue 3.33 in the panel “JMV449-NTSR1” in Supplementary Fig. 5d should be corrected. In addition, the sentence in lines 119–121 of the main text PDF beginning with “Noteworthily, a conserved salt bridge between...” should be slightly changed; e.g., “E3.33” should be changed to “E/D3.33” or to “acidic residue at position 3.33”. The shorter D3.33 side chain in NTSR1 compared to E3.33 in the related NTSR2, NMURs, ghrelin receptor, and motilin receptor probably affects the strength and possibly the role of the ionic interaction between the acidic residue at position 3.33 and R6.55 in NTSR1 compared to the above-mentioned related receptors. In the ghrelin receptor, the salt bridge between E3.33 and R6.55 has been proposed to play a role in the receptor’s constitutive activity [ https://doi.org/10.1038/s41... ], and the same could also apply to NTSR2. In contrast, NTSR1, which bears D3.33, has almost no constitutive activity. The shorter D3.33 side chain probably plays a role in agonist-induced activation of NTSR1 [DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abe5504 (ref. 47 in this preprint)] and is related to the “R6.55-mediated activation mechanism” that the authors of this preprint point out in the Discussion section.

The authors introduce inducible shRNAs against the native PRKACA into a PDX model of FLC. The shRNA target regions that are common for the DNAJB1-PRKACA and the native PRKACA. Inducing shRNA expression reduces protein levels of both proteins. The authors show a reduction in tumor volume in the PDX model during doxycycline treatment. However, expression of endogenous PRKACA is essential for most cell types and knockout of PRKACA is embryonically lethal. As the shRNAs are not specific to the fusion oncogene, no claim can be made that FLC cells are addicted to DNAJB1-PRKACA. Additionally, they fail to demonstrate specificity for FLC (e.g. by using the shRNAs in models of HCC).  The experiments demonstrate that PRKACA is an essential gene for FLC cells, which holds true for most cell types. The authors additionally demonstrate that two molecules that inhibit PRKACA also slow tumor growth. This result similarly fails to reveal oncogenic addiction: it lacks specificity between native PRKACA and DNAJB1-PRKACA as well as specificity for FLC. Therapeutic strategies that target PRKACA are expected to show significant toxicities to most cells and tumors. This undermines the conclusion that targeting PRKACA provides a viable therapeutic strategy for FLC.",2022-02-27T02:57:07,,Sanford Simon,10.1101/2022.01.31.477690,Evaluation of PRKACA as a Therapeutic Target for Fibrolamellar Carcinoma,"Stefanie S.

Genes of unknown functions represent a critical gap in microbiology as they prevent deeper insights into the ecology and evolution of key microbial traits and their impact on microbial phenotypes, thus, the purpose and findings of the study are of great interest. While we commend their efforts to unify known and unknown gene families and generate community resources such as https://novelfams.cgmlab.org/, we regretfully report that the manuscript by Rodríguez del Río et al. fails to acknowledge extensive previous work on this topic such as FUnkFams by Wyman et al. [1], and our recent study by Vanni et al. [2], which has made available a similar resource, AGNOSTOS-DB [3]. Even though studies mentioned here have already reported many of the major findings reported in Rodríguez del Río et al., the current manuscript does not cite FUnkFams, and cites Vanni et al. only once from the Introduction, without highlighting significant parallels between the approaches and findings of the two studies, which we find unfortunate. Here we highlight key similarities between Rodríguez del Río et al. (first posted on bioRxiv on January 27, 2022) and Vanni et al (first posted on bioRxiv on July 01, 2020): - Both studies report that the largest number of gene clusters with unknown function or novel protein families (hereafter referred to as unknowns) are found in uncultivated taxa.  Rodríguez del Río et al. describe their findings in the section "" High content of unknown protein families in the genomes of uncultivated taxa"". Vanni et al. report the same observation, "" the phyla with a larger number of MAGs are enriched in GCs of unknown function"" and are mainly composed of "" newly described phyla such as Cand. Riflebacteria and Cand. Patescibacteria (Anantharaman et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2015; Rinke et al., 2013), both with the largest unknown to known ratio"" (Figure 5D, Supp. Note 14) and that "" metagenome-assembled genomes are not only unveiling new regions of the microbial universe (42% of the reference genomes in GTDB_r86), but they are also enriching the tree of life with genes of unknown function"". - Both studies identify unknowns that are lineage-specific.  Rodríguez del Río et al. identify "" a core set of 980 protein family clusters synapomorphic for entire uncultivated lineages —that is, present in nearly all MAGs/SAGs from a given lineage (90% coverage) but never detected in other taxa (...) these newly discovered protein families can accurately distinguish 16 uncultivated phyla, 19 classes, and 90 orders, involving 179, 104, and 697 novel protein families, respectively."". Vanni et al. provide more than 600K lineage-specific gene clusters of unknown function within the domain Bacteria (36 at the phylum level, 428 at the class level, and 1,641 at the order level (Supp. Table 10)) and Archaea (1 phylum, 25 classes, and 378 orders (Supp. Table 13-1)). - Both studies conclude that there is an increase in the number of lineage-specific unknowns towards the lower levels of taxonomy (i.e., genus, and species).  Rodríguez del Río et al. report these results in Figure 3C and Vanni et al. in Figure 5A. - Both studies report that the unknowns could be considered relevant from an evolutionary perspective. Rodríguez del Río et al. provide a set of novel gene families that are phylogenetically conserved and under purifying selection, which parallels an observation that has been described in Vanni et al. based on phylogenetic conservatism of traits: "" the unknown GCs are more phylogenetically conserved (GCs shared among members of deep clades) than the known (Fig. 5B, p < 0.0001), revealing the importance of the genome's uncharacterized fraction. However, the lineage-specific unknown GCs are less phylogenetically conserved (Fig. 5B) than the known, agreeing with the large number of lineage-specific GCs observed at Genus and Species level (Fig. 5A)."" - Both studies find unknowns that are widely distributed in the environment. Rodríguez del Río et al. report that  "" the majority of the new protein families (55%) are detected in more than ten samples, span at least two habitats"", indicating a possible role as "" core molecular functions from widespread microbial lineages, or derive from promiscuous mobile elements."". Similarly, Vanni et al. report the existence of a ""pool of broadly distributed environmental unknowns"", which "" identified traces of potential ubiquitous organisms left uncharacterized by traditional approaches"". Furthermore, the results reported by Vanni et al. also support the findings observed by Coelho et al. [4] and mentioned by Rodríguez del Río et al. “ This result contrasts with the habitat-specific pattern observed for the majority of individual species-level genes ” where Vanni et al. also show the narrow ecological distribution of the unknown fraction reported in Figure 4D. In addition, as shown by our colleagues in Holland-Moritz et al. [5] the majority of these dominant unknown genes are associated with mobile genetic elements in the soil. - Both studies report a collection of small proteins of unknown function. In Rodríguez del Río et al. they report  "" 13,456 families of proteins shorter than 50 residues, 486 of which have been reported previously as novel functional genes"" in Sberro et al. (2019). Vanni et al. report a similar  finding: "" 12,313 high-quality gene clusters [..] encoding for small proteins ( "" Parallels in major scientific insights between the two studies likely stem from parallels in computational strategies implemented to study datasets of similar nature. Overlaps between computational approaches implemented and described by Vanni et al. and Rodríguez del Río et include the following: - Both studies apply strict quality and novelty filters to generate the basic dataset. In  Rodríguez del Río et al.  Figure 1A shows the basic workflow used to compile “ a collection of high-quality novel protein families from uncultivated taxa ”. Similarly, Vanni et al. workflow (Supp. Fig 1) produce “ highly conserved intra-homogeneous ” gene clusters (Figure 1B), “ both in terms of sequence similarity and domain architecture homogeneity; it exhausts any existing homology to known genes and provides a proper delimitation of the unknown genes ” to provide “ the best representation of the unknown space ”. - Both studies group the predicted genes into gene clusters using the clustering workflow of the software MMseqs2 [6] with a minimum identity threshold of 30%. - Both studies detect and remove spurious genes searching the AntiFam [7] database. - Both studies use a multi-search approach with different sensitivity levels to confidently identify unknowns. - Both studies search the unknowns against a database generated by Price et al. [8] using RB-TnSeq experiments.  Rodríguez del Río et al. wrote “ we mapped the protein family signatures derived from our catalog against the set of 11,779 unknown genes recently annotated based on genome-wide mutant fitness experiments, and found 69 matches to genes associated with specific growth conditions ”. Vanni et al. wrote, “ We searched the 37,684 genes of unknown function associated with mutant phenotypes from Price et al. (2018) [...] to identify genes of unknown function that are important for fitness under certain experimental conditions ”. - Rodríguez del Río et al. identify “ Synapomorphic protein families ”, “ by calculating the clade specificity and coverage of each protein family across all GTDB v202 lineages ”. “ Coverage was calculated as the number of genomes containing a specific protein family over the total number of genomes under the target clade. Specificity was estimated as the percentage of protein members within a family that belonged to the target clade. We considered protein families as synapomorphic if they contained at least 10 members (i.e., protein sequences from different genomes) and had a coverage higher than 0.9 and a specificity of 1.0 for a given lineage. ” Vanni et al. similarly identify a gene cluster as lineage-specific if present in less than half of all genomes and at least 2 with F1-score > 0.95 using the methods described in Mendler et al. [9], where the F1-score is calculated combining trait precision and sensitivity, where Precision indicates the degree to which a trait is conserved within a lineage, and sensitivity the exclusivity of that trait to a lineage. Indeed, both studies also included novel findings that are not covered by either. We recognize the following findings as novel findings that are unique to the study by Rodríguez del Río et al., and are not covered by recent literature to the best of our knowledge: - Rodríguez del Río et al. calculate the dN/dS ratio for each protein family, showing that the majority of unknown families are under a strong purifying selection (Figure 1B). - Rodríguez del Río et al. also investigate the presence of potential antimicrobial peptides in their novel families and “ found 965 unknown protein families in the genomic context of well-known antibiotic resistance genes, 25 of which are embedded in clear genomic islands with more than 3 resistance-related neighbor genes (as predicted by CARD) (Figure 2C). ” - Rodríguez del Río et al. report that “ unknown protein families are slightly enriched in transmembrane and signal peptide-containing proteins (being 7.6% and 7.9% more frequent than in eggNOG, respectively), which suggests that they may play an important role in mediating interactions with the environment.” - Vanni et al. pinpoint the potential of genomic context analyses to generate functional hypotheses both in Supp. Note 12 (“ Next, we examined the genomic neighborhood of the broad distributed EU on the MAG contigs. Investigating the genomic neighborhood can lead to the inference of a possible function of the EU. ”, Figure 12-1 C ) and in the genomic neighborhood analysis shown in Figure 6D. However, Rodríguez del Río et al. provide a much more exhaustive analysis of the genomic context of protein families of unknown function. They provide a summary of unknown protein families linked to metabolic marker genes (“ Presence/absence matrix of unknown protein families forming operon-like structures with marker genes involved in energy and xenobiotic degradation KEGG pathways in Figure 2A.” and “ unknown protein families tightly coupled with genes for every nitrogen cycling step (Figure 2B). ”). Overall, they identify “ 74,356 (17.98%) novel protein families in phylogenetically conserved operon regions ”, and a total of 1,344 families sharing a genomic context with “ genes related to energy production or xenobiotic compound degradation pathways ”. - Moreover, Rodríguez del Río et al. identify unknown families probability involved in “ cell-cell or cell-environment interactions ” and reported “ 502 novel families from the Patescibacteria group potentially involved in molecular transportation, 34 in adhesion, and 13 in cytokinesis ”. Science is incremental, and significant overlaps between different studies can be seen as an opportunity to address the reproducibility crisis in science. However, failure to recognize previous work appropriately has serious implications. Not only does it make it difficult for future generations to trace the origins of novel ideas, but also impacts the careers and well-being of ECRs. We hope the authors will reconsider their omission of the previous work and cite novel findings that are already published. Antonio Fernandez-Guerra, On behalf of all authors of Vanni et al.

Answering your question about the sterility of selection - this research forms part of a broader and long-term study of various life forms in permafrost, mainly microorganisms. In our work, we used the methods accepted, tested and published by many microbiologists (Juck DF, et al., 2005; Shi et al., 1997; Abramov et al., 2021). Unlike you expected permafrost is not a dynamic system; on the contrary, it is a very stable environment, with a constant negative temperature, the absence of free water and the possibility of diffusion from the surface of modern soil. The burrow where the nematodes were isolated was collected from a depth of about 40 meters from the surface. It remained frozen during sampling, transport and storage in the laboratory. Live worms were obtained in the laboratory after thoroughly cleaning the frozen sample under sterile conditions and thawing. In the frozen sample, the organisms  were in a cryptobiotic/frozen state. The absence of background contamination is very important - nematodes (as well as living protozoa) were obtained only from this burrow sample, and they were not found in the enclosing frozen sediment above and below the burrow.  Apart from our study, several other studies of living organisms isolated from samples of buried burrows and soils of the Kolyma outcrops have already been published by biologists and virologists (Yashina et al., 2012; Legendre et al., 2014). As for your question regarding the radiocarbon dating, this outcrop has been previously dated by many paleontologists and geologists using various methods (Murton et al., 2015), our dating correlates well with data obtained earlier. We did not carbon date the nematode itself, but the plant material contained in the burrow. The method of radiocarbon dating of plant or animal material from an ancient burrow is accepted widely  in studies of  lifeforms  survived in the permafrost  (Abramovetal.,2021). We really appreciate your interest in our work and thank you for your comments.

I think the applicable audience would be considerably greater if you add a few comparisons including: 1. delivery efficiency of the icRNA compared against traditional 5' capped, 3' polyA mRNA with/without nucleoside modifications and the prior reported pre-injected circularized RNA systems (with same IRES) A. If you do compare to standard polyA mRNA, one of the benefits that could be included is better packaging efficiency in LNPs since the polyA is known to disrupt efficient LNP production 2. Delivery efficacy as a percent transfection or geometric mean fluorescence in vitro with dose titration. The figure 1 b microscope image is also missing scale bars 3. Delivery efficacy in vivo for expression assessment with luciferase RNA at a minimum would be much more informative than immunogenicity assessment or gene editing Other comments from a limited read through: 1. ELISA presentation without indicating the dilution factor of the serum (I see 50-fold dilution in methods) doesn't give much information beyond the fact that it seems your LNPs or RNA cargo didn't work particularly well compared to standard LNPs with nucleoside modified mRNA 2. one of the primary benefits of pre-endocytosis circularized mRNA is thought to be avoidance of TLR activation. It might be beyond the scope, but you could consider comparing the different constructs for TLR and RIG-I activation using in vitro reporter lines like those from Invivogen. 3. Presumably in situ circularization is not compatible with nucleoside modifications but it'd be really interesting to check given that that the non-nucleoside modified RNA as a linear construct being endocytosed would encounter the same TLR challenges experienced as standard mRNA. Perhaps there's a way to generate a hybrid construct where the regions acted upon enzymatically are unmodified and you can incorporate nucleoside modifications for the coding sequence to minimize inherent immunogenicity?",2022-02-22T02:23:47,disqus_2QfOMtjwMY,David R.

So, in order: 1 - It is likely that its a similar mixture of EHG and WHG as e.g. Iron Gates HG-s, and in general it seemed more of an eastern characteristics, but sadly for the relatively lower coverages and relatively high dilution even in Bk-II of this component we were not able to run such analyses. Also, I tried qpGraph, but the high level of intermixture between populations (including the many background of their overall HG ancestry from West, EEF and East, just to name the main lineages) of this era made the results highly unreliable and complicated. Maybe in the future with better coverages and higher HG component samples. 2 - We did not calculate the actual percentage of this HG ancestry in other populations for low coverages and high similarities to other HG-s, we would need more data in the future for that. 3 - Sadly the skull of S13 preserved only without significant distortion, the other bone material was highly distorted for the swampy, moisty soil of the site, making such analyses extremely unreliable. I personally struggled a lot to assemble the skull remains to get a basic idea of cranial shape at least, but if you check individual S11 at SI section 1 you can see what am I talking about.

I appreciate your interest in COHCAP, but I thought that I should mention a couple things: 1) You cited the COHCAP corrigendum, not a primary reference for the method or applications. This would be OK if you were citing something was specifically said in the corrigendum.  Likewise, there are comments that complement the factual errors that were formally corrected. However, I think you may have meant to cite the following? https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... I apologize that I think this is confusing.  PubMed correctly lists the 2019 citation as an "" Erratum"" if you view the original publication, although the separate listing for the corrigendum might look similar to a regular publication in PubMed among a set of search results. 2) The default setting for the methylation threshold is 0.7 and the default setting for the unmethylated threshold is 0.3. For the patient data, we do offer using 0.3 as a troubleshooting suggestion. This may already be clear to some or most readers, although I wanted to mention again that some testing of various parameters may be needed.  I also tend to use COHCAP along with at least 1 other method (such as methylKit) to try and assess the data, even if only 1 method is used in the paper (which may or may not be COHCAP). There is a newer location for support questions on GitHub ( https://github.com/cwarden4..., but most previous questions are still on SourceForge ( https://sourceforge.net/p/c.... So, I think that is OK, but I am not sure if something like the following helps give additional context for readers of this paper: https://sourceforge.net/p/c... I believe that you referenced the use of thresholds rather than the method, but I am not saying that a beta value of 0.31 is truly significantly different than a beta value 0.29 by itself.  The thresholds are 2 possible criteria out of several parameters considered in COHCAP, with the goal being to look for differential methylation. I hope this helps. Thank you again!

Building on OME, as discussed, is great.  But I find that a far larger problem than instrument settings is not having information on the biology (and other reagents).  Knowing that an image was taken with a 60x N.A. 1.4 Nikon planapochromat lens at 100 ms with an Andor Zyla 5.5, LED excitation at 555 nm, bandpass emission 580+/- 40 nm, with Micromanager 2 beta with ImageJ 1.53q23 running under Java 1.8.005.93b is irrelevant if you don't know the cell type and molecule labeled.  In fact, we could change every detail of the technical minutiae about the microscope to digital file and the only important thing would be the cell type and molecule labeled.  Metadata need to prompt the user to include details about the experiment.  Proprietary systems do save the technical details pretty well, at least for standard imaging, but none record the biology (or whatever is being imaged).  One critical field that’s should be added a phrase stating the goal of the experiment (like a tweet).  Every notice that when you go for a clinical diagnostic medical procedure that the technician enters all sorts of data about the patient or pulls them out of an existing record?  This is what is missing from microscopy metadata.  This is where there really is a crisis. Sample prep and biological samples are mentioned in the introduction, but are largely absent throughout the text.

Their data presented in this manuscript include a reduction in lifespan and a cardiac phenotype that starts in young mice and is characterized by cardiac hypertrophy that ends up in cardiac dilatation and fibrosis. The cardiac phenotype is also present in two cardiac-specific MKK6 KO models, which is consistent with an important role of MKK6 in the heart. Importantly, they present mechanistic data to propose a model in which MKK6 deficiency leads to hyperphosphorylation of MKK3-p38γ/δ and increased mTOR signaling, a well-known cause of cardiac hypertrophy. The paper is well structured, the data is clearly explained and the results are relevant in the sense that they identify a novel pathway in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. After reviewing this preprint, these are our questions and comments to the authors that we think may help to improve this manuscript. Major points: The image that is represented in Fig. 2D may not be the best to represent the size effect observed for cardiac fibrosis. Most of the mice seem to show a similar degree of fibrosis. Also these mice are 23-24 month-old, long after the first mice start to die due to cardiac dysfunction, so this specific population of Mkk6 KO mice may show some kind of resistance to develop cardiac dysfunction when compared to others that died before. If cardiac dysfunction is the cause of the death, it should be present earlier in life. Thus, measurement of cardiac fibrosis at an earlier time point would be important to sustain authors’ claims. The investigation of the two cardiac-specific KO is very relevant for the conclusions of this study. It would be important to know whether those cardiac-specific KO develop similar phenotype compared to that developed by the global KO, besides the cardiac hypertrophy already described. There is no mention of the n of animals used for the data shown in Fig. 5. For example, Fig. 1A has panels with n=2 and n=1, whereas Fig. 1B and Fig. 1C has n=4. This should be better described, and mentioned in figure legend. Minor points: Data shown on Fig.1 re MKK6 KO animals is shown at different ages. It would be beneficial for the message of the paper to clarify the progression of symptoms in these mice. For example, Fig. 1C shows phenotype at 20 months of age, but then kyphosis is shown on Fig.1D at 19 weeks of age. It could be a typo but anyway paper would improve by clarifying this aspect. Fig. 1D does not have a scale bar but taking into account that MKK6 KO animals are smaller, if images have been enlarged to show better the kyphosis, a scale bar is needed. Authors may discuss this possibility if they do not have the data available. Authors claim that MKK6 KO mice have decreased BW due to increased browning of the adipose tissue and increased energy expenditure. However, it seems they have not considered the possibility that they have a reduced food intake, which could be the case due to the ataxia present in these animals. On Fig. 2, the observed size effect on different cardiac parameters may be better visualized if authors include the baseline value 0 for each parameter measured. Scale bar units in Fig. 2D does not match with what is stated in Fig legends. After the mention of puromycin, the source of the remaining antibodies is not mentioned. Why did the authors use a global p38gamma but a MCK-driven p38delta-specific KO to study the role of these 2 kinases in the phenotype of MKK6 KO mice? We found no reasoning behind that explained in the manuscript and doing so would help the readership of this paper.",2022-02-14T13:24:42,jessicapolka,Jessica Polka,10.1101/2021.11.15.468612,MKK6 deficiency promotes cardiac dysfunction through MKK3-p38γ/δ-mTOR hyperactivation,"Rafael Romero-Becerra, Alfonso Mora, Elisa Manieri, Laura Sanz, Ivana Nikolic, Ayelén M.

I sincerely hope that the concerned labs will respond in a productive and open-minded manner. I am not qualified to discuss most of the technical aspects of this preprint but had a suggestion that might be, if nothing else, fun to do with the Infernal/R-scape work: (Writing from memory so please excuse any mistakes in names) The authors aptly show that the Hox9a hTL shoes no evolutionary signal for a conserved RNA structure. They also discuss inconsistencies with cryo-EM data with regards to the P4-ES9S interaction. Infernal/R-scape cannot natively work on trans interactions - but perhaps by stitching the P4 and ES9S sequences from the already studied ~550 genomes together with a synthetic, fixed stem loop sequence, Infernal/R-scape could be used to assess the likelihood of a evolutionary signal for the trans interaction? The idea would be that a P4 and ES9S sequence from a single genome would be stitched together and then subjected to assessment after alignment. I'm not sure what the Eddy or Rivas groups would say about such a use of their tool..",2022-02-12T04:05:27,,S.
