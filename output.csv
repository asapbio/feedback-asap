There are a few questions regarding the architecture and the benchmark study. 1. Is the loss function for the loss function of RGN2 (i.e. loss function for the output of the geometry module). Is it the same as RGN1, i.e. dRMSD, or a new loss function that can differentiate mirrored structures. 2. The performance of RGN1 is highly dependent on the random seed used to initialize the training. Is this still the case for RGN2? In other words, for the same testing protein, if we use two RGN2 models trained on the same training set but different random initialization, what is the GDT_TS between the two resulting structure models? 3. What is the accuracy of predicted theta and phi? This question is similar to a comment on the RGN1 paper ( https://www.biorxiv.org/con... which was not fully explored. It is likely that including an auxiliary loss for theta and phi can not only improve local structure correctness but also resolve the chirality issue, which was not addressed by the dRMSD loss. 4. Both RGN1 and RGN2 construct the peptide chain in torsion space, i.e. Ramachandran angles for RGN1;  a bond angle phi and a torsion angle theta for RGN2.  As pointed out by a recent preprint ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2105...., ""One well-known problem is that internal coordinates are extremely sensitive to small deviations as the latter easily propagate through the protein, generating large errors in the reconstructed structure [37]."" Is there an attempt to address this issue? 5. RGN2 is trained on ASTRAL domains, most of which are ""normal"" proteins that are neither orphan nor designed proteins. Therefore, the single-sequence structure prediction performance difference between RGN2 and third-party programs (AlphaFold2, RoseTTaFold and trRosetta) should be comparable regardless of whether the testing proteins are orphan or not, provide that only a single sequence rather than MSAs is fed to the three third-party programs. On non-orphan proteins, e.g. CASP14 FM targets that are not used in RGN2 training, can RGN2 still outperform single-sequence-based AlphaFold2.

I am curious to hear why the authors did not make any reference to the fact that if Spike is inducing endothelial inflammation via integrin5 and NF-KB, this means that there is a very real risk of such occurrence in people vaccinated with mRNA and vectorized vaccines that lead to the endogenous production of full length (or, even only RBD) of Spike. In other words, 2+2 should equal 4, even in these strange times.

We believe that we address many of these concerns in the manuscript and supplemental materials and we are happy to address them again here. To our knowledge, possible artifacts include carry-over effects, irreversible aggregation, and EX1-like behavior. Our results are reproducible (highlighted in figure 2C though we acknowledge we can and should include more demonstrations of reproducibility in our next draft) despite samples being injected in random order, which is not consistent with a carry-over effect. We demonstrate reversibility (figure 2C, supplemental figure 3C), proving this is not irreversible aggregation. And our observed bimodal distributions have a fixed ratio during continuous-labeling time courses at 25C (supplemental figure 3A/B), which is not classic EX1 or EXX behavior, but is most consistent with two structurally distinct, slowly interconverting forms undergoing EX2 exchange. Some might call this sort of sample heterogeneity an “artifact”, but this heterogeneity is exactly what we are aiming to characterize in this manuscript. In regard to this being an artifact specific to our sample, in our manuscript we report this reversible bimodal behavior for three variants of the spike protein prepared in two different labs. Not included in this manuscript is HDX data for other spike constructs from two other labs that also show this same behavior. We would also like to point out, as we did in our manuscript, that bimodal or multimodal distributions can detect multiple conformations and have been used to great effect in other studies of viral proteins (we think Benhaim et al. Science Advances 2020 is a particularly good example). Additionally, the structural transition we report in this manuscript is consistent with Cryo-EM data of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (Edwards et al. NSMB 2021), and of structural transitions of other viral spike proteins that have been previously studied (Gilman et al. Nature Communications 2019). We are aware of three publications that include HDX data of the spike ectodomain, Raghuvamsi et al. eLife 2020, Zuzic et al. biorXiv 2021, and Huang and Nguyen et al bioRxiv 2021. We have already included a supplementary note to address the fact that Raghuvamsi et al., and Huang and Nguyen et al. did not observe the heterogeneity we report. While we have not had conversations with the Anand lab, we have discussed our results with the D’Arcy lab. In reviewing their data - they do note wider than expected isotopic distributions that are consistent with the heterogeneity we report, although in their case it does not result in two separately quantifiable distributions, likely due to the multiple reasons we discuss in our supplemental note. Zuzic et al. do report a bimodal distribution for a single peptide, in a region where we too observe bimodal behavior, and conclude this is consistent with heterogeneity, but do not state whether this is observed in other regions, or why it was not observed or noted in Raghuvamsi et al, despite appearing to share the same data set. To summarize what we have said here and what we say in our supplemental note, we believe that all released spike HDX data sets are consistent with our findings. Lastly, we agree that it is important to include raw isotopic distributions across relevant timescales, which is why we include them in our supplemental information (supplemental figure 3A/B). We also include observed isotopic distributions many other times in our manuscript to support our conclusions (figure 2A/B, figure 3D, figure 4A, and supplemental figure 3C). For ease of plotting and for clarity, these are extracted distributions (normalized intensity for each isotopic state for an individual peptide).

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.04.451066v1#comment-5481035988,biorxivstage,1,"Hi Charles, One reason I didn't include Canu in my tests was the excessive amount of start/end overlap that it usually creates (as described in that FAQ link you gave). This complicates the sequence analysis (you have to fix this overlap before adjusting the contig start position) and often necessitates additional manual intervention if using Canu assemblies as input to Trycycler. More generally, Flye is my overall favourite assembler for bacterial genomes for a number of reasons. In particular, its assemblies have fewer 'glitchy' regions than other assemblers. In the benchmarking study, this is demonstrated by Flye's low 'max indel' values. In the Trycycler preprint, we measure this with 'worst-100-bp identity'. Since I think Flye is the best single assembler for bacterial genomes, I wanted it to be the main point of comparison with Trycycler. Put another way, based on the results in the benchmarking study, I expect Canu would perform considerably worse than Flye in the Trycycler paper analysis. And regarding the links in the paper, one is to a Trycycler paper GitHub repo ( https://github.com/rrwick/T... which has most of the data and scripts, and the other link is to a bridges site ( https://bridges.monash.edu/... which contains datasets too large for the GitHub repo. If I understand correctly, you were expecting a link to the Trycycler GitHub repo as well? That's a good point, and I will add that in the next version of this paper. Hope that clarifies things!

Most terms are mixed without understanding of their meaning: uncertainty, error, model, map, accuracy, validation. There is a complete mental confusion in this article, and many of the proposed solution arise because of ignorance of the underlying problems and basic misunderstanding of statistical analysis. Aggregation at the pixel level. Do the authors realize that this is again nonsense? Spatial prediction is made at point, pixels are just visualization. Aggregating (I guess the authors mean averaging) means that the short-scale variation is removed. This is simply wrong and the same as manual modification of the data. This is explained in any spatial statistics book, see the book of Cressie (1991). For accuracy statistics, see Janssen et al (1995). The paper of Janssen explain what are accuracy statistics, and how to use them. This is basic literature, but still… Janssen, P. H. M., & Heuberger, P. S. C. (1995). Calibration of process-oriented models. Ecological Modelling, 83(1-2), 55-66. “spatial insight into the model inaccuracies” is not provided by bootstrapping. This is explained in any book on ecological modelling. Do the authors work in a bubble? And 100 bootstrap is too little to obtain a reliable confidence interval. There are other solutions in the literature, such as quantile regression. But for this the authors should read the literature. At some point the authors attempt to detect extrapolation, I must say this is poorly made and again there are a lot of confusion of what extrapolation is. I would simply argue that the sampling data should have sufficient coverage to not have to worry about this problem, and if extrapolation occurs the prediction intervals will show it. Also, extrapolation is not simply related min-max of predictor variables. The authors want to detect extrapolation but then use spatial cross-validation to force extrapolation, that is, validation of the model at unseen places in both geographic and predictor space to correct for spatial correlation. Again, the serious literature never recommended this, can you please read the book of Cressie on spatial statistics and validation of spatial models? I am sorry to say that also the discussion and recommendation is poor. What about validation of models? Overall in the paper the authors are confused about uncertainty and error, and between the different sources of uncertainty.

The emphasis, understandably, is on the mechanistic basis of the fitness-benefit arising from the duplication of the ancestral gene that gave rise to the two ERN paralogues: the broadly expressed ERN1 and mucous producing secretory epithelium-selective ERN2 of vertebrates. The finding that epithelial-selective depletion of mouse Xbp1, phenocopies the consequences of germline deletion of Ern2 is taken as evidence that Ern2 exerts at least some of its effects in goblet cells, via XBP1 - an effector common to the products of both ERN genes (IRE1a and IRE1b). This conclusion is plausible, but the data presented in figure 1A and 3A also suggests that the consequences of XBP1 depletion in terms of Alcian Blue positive cell number are 2X more severe than those of Ern2 deletion (~0.17 cells per crypt in wildtype, versus ~0.12 in the Ern2∆ and ~0.06 in the XBP1∆). This may arise from XBP1 having a broad role in tissue development, with secondary consequences on goblet cells, but may also arise from a contribution of IRE1a (the product of the Ern1 gene) to XBP1 splicing in goblet cells - in other words reflecting functional redundancy between the two ERN isoforms in mucous producing cells. The latter possibility seems at odds with the emphasis in the abstracts on non-redundancy of the two isoforms, which suggests important qualitative differences between the two, whereas the two genes may in fact be pullin.g in the same direction, in so far as their effector functions are concerned.",2021-07-30T10:11:56,disqus_JNVBDeaHLu,David Ron,10.1101/2021.07.28.453864,The epithelial-specific ER stress sensor IRE1β enables host-microbiota crosstalk to affect colon goblet cell development,"Michael J.

Some mechanisms for microtubule polarity sorting in axons had been previously proposed but were recognised as being insufficient to fully explain the observations. Very nice original science with important implications for nervous system development, axon regeneration and neurodegenerative disease. Summary of findings Unlike dendrites, axons have microtubules that are almost all oriented with their growing (+) ends outwards. The mechanistic basis of this is not completely understood. Axonal microtubules are in a constant state of dynamic equilibrium, with their + ends growing but being subject to periodic ‘catastrophe’ that shortens them, either by dying back from their previously growing + ends or by severing them to create two 'daughter' microtubules, each with the potential for new growth. Unlike in other cell types, axonal microtubules are not attached to the centrosome but form a tiling array along the axon composed of individual microtubules from a few microns to over 100 microns in length (see work of Peter Baas and colleagues). Some kind of relationship between this dynamic equilibrium and selection of polarity appears likely but it has been unclear what that might be. To understand the mechanism, Jakobs et al used live imaging of microtubules in Drosophila axons in culture, labelled with EB1-GFP, which marks the growing tip. They find that during early axon growth in culture, microtubules with their + ends oriented distally have a growth advantage over those in the opposite orientation, so that over time + end-out becomes the dominant orientation. First, they show that each microtubule growth events is (on average) longer if the microtubule is further distal in a growing axon and if the microtubule is oriented + end out. The difference between + end out, and in, microtubules is more marked distally. Then, they measure the shrinkage distances in these same orientations and locations using double labelling of EB1 and tubulin. They use a mathematical model to show that + end-out oriented microtubules near growing tips have essentially unbounded growth (since the average growth event is longer in distance than the average shrinkage event), while in other locations and orientations average microtubule length stabilises because of the larger contribution of shrinkage events. Using two methods to disrupt microtubule polymerisation (nocodazole and increased osmolarity) they then confirmed the importance of this +/- growth difference in establishing unipolarity. They also hypothesised that microtubule growth promoting proteins locally synthesised at the axon tip, such as p150, would explain the longer growth cycles of +end out oriented microtubules there, and supported this hypothesis with p150 knockdown and dominant negative mutants. Again, removing the growth length differential also removed the orientation difference. Finally, they address the orientation imbalance in more proximal axon regions that is less easy to explain based on a p150 gradient. They propose a model in which dynein-mediated sliding of – end out orientated microtubules towards the cell body, and templating of new microtubules, essentially matching existing orientation bias, could explain these differences. No additional data are presented for this part but it clearly forms a new hypothesis for further testing. Implications Axonal transport deficits are an important driver of axon loss and neurological deficits. For example, mutations in the anterograde motor protein KIF5A are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, Charcot-Marie Tooth disease and ALS, all disorders of long axon degeneration in which distal regions are affected first. Toxic blockade of axonal transport, for example in vincristine neuropathy, is also an important cause of axon damage. This article sheds light on the basic mechanisms that establish, and presumably also maintain effective, directional axonal transport. Severe defects in this process of selection would be expected to result in failure of neuronal differentiation or axon growth. The likely phenotypic outcome of a severe defect would be embryonic lethality but partial defects could also occur and could therefore underlie disorders of axonal transport even if axons do initially form and carry out the process. Indeed, p150 mutations are associated with ALS. It would be really interesting to know how such mutations affect microtubule polarity and whether this underlies pathogenesis in these cases of ALS, or indeed in any other neurodegenerative disorders. It is challenging to address this in vivo, even in animal models, because of the requirement for live imaging of microtubule growth so I am not aware of any previous studies, but it is in principle an achievable aim now this mechanism has been identified. Limitations At present these findings are limited to Drosophila axons (seemingly dispersed starting from the entire CNS?) so it remains to be confirmed whether there are similar patterns in mammalian axons, and in different neuronal subtypes (e.g., CNS/PNS, motor/sensory, etc). Minor suggestions for improvement Just a presentational thing but in Fig 1E legend, would it be clearer to say ‘blue, right to left downwards’ than ‘blue, left to right upwards’ since these microtubule are in fact growing from right to left? Or probably the colour-coding explained in part D is already sufficient without this extra explanation? A bit more introduction to what is templating and sliding would be helpful. It would be just marginally easier to follow without the switch in axon orientation between Figs 1-3 and Fig 4. But this is a minor point that perhaps just keeps our reversal learning sharp anyway! Questions for the authors Superficially, it could be imagined that the more stable an axonal microtubule the better, since they are so crucial for axonal transport. Yet, this is clearly not the case, otherwise the state of dynamic equilibrium would not have evolved. Does this new model for selection of orientation shed any light on what that advantage of the dynamic equilibrium is? Studies of shrinkage events are so far limited to shrinkage from the distal end. Is there any contribution also from severing and how could that be measured? If +end-out microtubules at the distal end have unbounded growth what eventually stops them? Something must do this in the end because otherwise a mature axon would be clogged with lots of microtubules extending right up to the distal tip. Is this one of the functions of severing? In Fig 3b and c, there seems to be not only a decrease in + end-out growth distances but an increase in the growth of – end out microtubules. The same is true in Fig 3j and k when p150 is disrupted. Are these consistent observations and what could explain them? It would seem more likely that these interventions would disrupt microtubule growth regardless of orientation? To what extent do you think similar mechanisms may operate in mature axons, or is this phenomenon limited to axon growth stages? At the very least it seems likely that they also recur during axon regeneratio but in this context it would be very interesting to know if there are CNS/PNS differences in vertebrates given the difference in axon regeneration.",2021-07-29T10:14:35,disqus_VYxqCWKMak,Michael Coleman,10.1101/2021.06.03.446862,Unrestrained growth of correctly oriented microtubules instructs axonal microtubule orientation,"Maximilian AH Jakobs, Assaf Zemel, Kristian Franze",2021-06-03

I think those also had duplications and repeats that added more complication than your average assembly. While I think the most important message was a need to critically assess each sample's assembly on a case-by-case basis (without locking down one single assembly method and parameters in advance), I thought Canu tended to perform better than Flye on the samples that I have worked with. So, I was surprised that I didn't see any Canu results in this preprint, even though I also noticed that you said you did a previous benchmark. Since the title of the paper says "" Bacterial,"" I guess checking for circular BAC constructs is slightly off topic.  However, Canu does have a suggestCircular output column, and I found it useful for providing a good ""initial"" assembly for circular sequences (even if that particular column wasn't perfect). It looks like you encourage the use of additional polishing, which matches my experience.  I also strongly agree with the point "" Trycycler is not a fully automated pipeline – it requires human judgement and intervention."". However, is it out of the question to have comparisons with Canu assemblies, and/or have something to add for others like myself that found Canu to be preferable to Flye for other circular assemblies (with additional downstream steps, such as the MUMmer visualization recommended on the Canu FAQ)? 2) I encountered an issue clicking the Data availability link in the abstract.

I have 1–2 suggestions regarding the structural comparison with the related neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), e.g. as shown in Extended Data Fig. 8f. As inactive-state NTSR1 structure, the complex of rat NTSR1 with the full agonist neurotensin 8–13 fragment is shown (PDB ID: 4BUO). While this structure was obtained without G protein and adopts a closed conformation at the cytosolic side, the extracellular receptor half is virtually identical to other agonist-bound, active-state (or active-like) NTSR1 structures (e.g., PDB IDs: 6OS9, 4XEE, or 4GRV). We have recently determined three structures of rNTSR1 bound to two inverse agonists. Compared to the agonist-bound structures, the inverse agonists caused a pronounced outward tilting of the extracellular ends of TM6 and especially TM7, and of ECL3. It may be interesting to point out the similarity between GHSR and NTSR1 in the large extracellular displacement of TM7 upon activation / inactivation. PDB IDs: 6Z4S (structure with the least engineering), 6ZIN, 6Z4Q. Full story DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abe5504 We also shed additional light on the activation mechanism of NTSR1, and on how nonpeptidic agonists and inverse agonists modulate receptor activity. There are striking analogies and some interesting differences between our findings with NTSR1 and those on GHSR presented here (e.g., the involvement of residues 3.33 and 6.55; the importance of the aromatic cluster composed by residues 6.44, 6.48, 6.51, 6.58, and 7.42; cavity II in GHSR and a corresponding hydrophobic sub-pocket in NTSR1 crucial for activation / inactivation). Presenting a slightly more detailed comparison of NTSR1 and GHSR may substantially expand our mechanistic understanding of the ghrelin family receptors and thus represent another valuable contribution to the field.

While wound repair in multicellular organisms is well-studied, wound repair in single cells is not as well understood. To address this, the authors used a microfluidic guillotine in order to inflict wounds with both low (Regime 1) and high (Regime 2) viscous stress to wound Stentor cells. They then used a fluorescence-based assay to visualize the timescales and mechanisms of wound repair in Stentor. The authors discovered three mechanical modes of wound repair: contraction, cytoplasm retrieval, and twisting/pulling. Furthermore, they concluded that Stentor requires 100-1000 seconds to close the wound and that the timescale depended on the severity of the wound. This manuscript’s experiments were well-designed with convincing results, and we recommend its publication after the major and minor points below are addressed. Major Points 1.      The authors observed that while most of the injured cells used at least one mechanical mode of wound repair, no cell used all three modes that they characterized. This raises the question about how/why a given mechanical mode of wound response is selected by a cell. For instance, cells wounded under Regime 1 preferentially use contraction or cytoplasm retrieval over the twisting/pulling method, but how does the cell choose to use one over the other or a combination of the two? Possible reasons include the energy cost of each method or potential correlations between cell sizes and the mode of wound response. Or the mechanical mode of wound response used could also be completely random. 2.      In their conclusions, the authors address that the large variation in the time it took for cells to heal could be due to differences in initial cell size. They provide a supplemental figure for cell size variation (Additional File 1, Figure S4), but it would be useful to include such a figure within the paper itself. In doing so, the authors could compare the initial cell sizes with the time it took the cells to heal to determine whether cell size truly does correlate with the timescale of healing and whether it warrants further investigation. 3.      Within the paper, the text states that cytoplasm retrieval was utilized by about 50% of cells wounded in Regime 1 and by only about 35% of cells wounded in Regime 2. Despite this, Figure 3B shows cytoplasm retrieval by cells wounded in Regime 2 rather than cells wounded in Regime 1. Referencing figures that align with the findings, for instance, representative images of a cell wounded in Regime 1 undergoing cytoplasm retrieval rather than a cell wounded in Regime 2, would better reflect the observations, and support the conclusions made in the paper. 4. 	The use of the microfluidic “guillotine” as intended was ensured through previous research utilizing and developing it, which is cited in this paper. The microfluidic “guillotine” could theoretically stop functioning and lead to no wounding of the cells, but the Sytox Green staining indicates that because the lack of any staining to a cell would suggest it was never wounded. However, it would be helpful to see a control for the microfluidic “guillotine” in which the cells travel through a similar apparatus but would not be cut. This would control for any contributions that travel through this device could have on wound healing. Minor Points 1.      Figure 1G indicates that cells wounded under Regime 2 took about 1000 seconds to heal, yet the brightfield and corresponding fluorescence images of wounded cells in Figure 1F jump from 630 seconds, in which a wounded cell with Sytox staining is still visible, to 7230 seconds. It would be easier to follow Figure 1F if it better aligned with Figure 1G and the observations made in the paper by including an imaging panel at or around 1000 seconds that shows a healed cell for Regime 2. 2.      Within the text, the authors state that the cell’s oral apparatus was stained very brightly by immunofluorescence of acetylated tubulin in Figure 2. Yet Figure 2 itself does not have the oral apparatus labelled, nor is the oral apparatus mentioned in the figure legend. Per the text, the disruption or complete absence of the oral apparatus in cells wounded under Regime 1 or 2 indicated the severity of the wound and was useful in visualizing the cell’s healing process. Thus, it makes sense to label such an important visual aid in the figure itself, in addition to mentioning it in the text. 3.      It would be easier to follow the contraction mode of wound response in Figure 3A in the paper if, instead of an arrow pointing to the wound, a red line was drawn through the wound to show the wound’s diameter and how it changes as time proceeds, as was included in Additional File 1, Figure S3.",2021-07-27T21:49:16,mugdha_sathe,Mugdha Sathe,10.1101/2020.11.12.379123,Microfluidic guillotine reveals multiple timescales and mechanical modes of wound response in Stentor coeruleus,"Kevin S.

I can think of a number of questions, but I hope these are the most important: 1) I noticed that you filter for samples with “ 10,000 and <500,000 classified microbial reads.” Does this filter also apply to returning results to customers? Based upon data / results I will mention in 2), I believe my cat’s samples may have had ~25% bacterial reads (at least for the ~15% WGS sample).  For the earlier lcWGS samples (for “Health + Breed” kits), I thought they were 2-4 million reads each.  If the Dental Health Test was similar, then I think my cat’s sample(s) would have had “ <500,000 classified microbial reads ”.  However, I am not sure if I am misunderstanding something? 2) You can see the various measurements for my 1 cat here: https://github.com/cwarden45/Bastu_Cat_Genome/tree/master/basepaws_Dental_Health_Test My question is whether there is some figure in this preprint that I can use to compare the scores for my cat (or any customer can do for their cat), compared to the density distributions cases and controls used for the risk estimation in this paper (for what I might call a training set)? I am also curious if those proportions say consistent among batches (and filtered samples or full samples, if they are all returned to customers). I think this might be similar to Figure 3, but I am not sure how to map the scores for my cat. 3) Relative to the ordinary sample collection, is anything added to the liquid to limit or prevent post-collection bacterial blooms? If something was already added, is there any evidence that helps restrict / prevent bacterial growth from earlier tests? 4) The Competing Interest Statement currently says “ The authors have declared no competing interest ”.  However, because you are working for a company that offers a Dental Health Test based upon these results, I believe you need to declare a competing interest.  Is there something that I might be missing? Thanks again!

The authors have clearly shown that APE1 is a thylakoid membrane protein required for the proper function of PSII at high light intensities. The absence of APE1 leads to changes in thylakoid architecture and an altered composition of photosynthetic complexes (20% less D1/D2 and 20% more LHCII in ape1). In this new submission, they have unequivocally demonstrated that APE1 directly interacts with PSII (co-migration of APE1 with the monomer and dimer of PSII which is altered in deltaPSII but not in deltaPSI as well as cross-linking with PSII). Furthermore, they have shown that in the absence of APE1, PSII supercomplexes (sc) accumulate (BN-2D and in vivo measurements of antenna size). This accumulation of PSII sc leads to photoinhibition and the authors propose that the role of APE1 is to modulate the formation of supercomplexes for optimal photosynthesis. I largely agree with these conclusions and think that this body of work moves the field forward. I have several comments however that should be addressed (see below). My main issue lies in the interpretation of Figure 7A and B (photoinhibition experiment) and lines 314-318. My previous comment on that point still stands: if D1 damage would be increased in ape1, we should expect a lower amount of D1 upon inhibition of repair. However according to Fig7B, this is not the case ( ape1 has apparently the same level of D1 as in wt). The mph1 mutant described by Liu and Last 2015 Plant Journal 82:731–743, is proposed to have more PSII damage which translates as less D1 accumulation upon inhibition of repair (coincidentally also in Figure 7B!) Granted this is in Arabidopsis and the timepoint for D1 is 2h HL, I would still recommend repeating that experiment e.g. a 2h HL+inh checking D1 accumulation. As is, what I take away from Fig7B is that the rate of repair is slower in ape1. If I understand correctly, the authors imply that because of the large antenna size, D1 is more prone to photodamage but given this other interpretation (slower D1 repair), how about the idea that repair is slower due to D1 being more trapped in PSII dimer and sc? You discuss this idea in paragraph from line 519. This interpretation better fits the conservation of APE1 in cyanobacteria which do not possess PSII sc and agrees with the possible constitutive function in maintenance of PSII state described line 516. The title of the article should then be changed accordingly. Major comments Line 71 - I understand the decision from the authors to cite reviews and state that “many” proteins are involved in PSII biogenesis, maintenance and repair. I would however recommend citing Liu and Last 2019 Frontiers in Plant Science 10:975 and either introduce or discuss more what factors are known to modulate PSII sc (e.g. from this review MET1; in met1 mutant less PSII SC, accelerated D1 degradation; as stated above should we expect ape1, more PSII SC, slower D1 degradation?) Line 114, line 256 - RC47 should be defined as reaction center 47 (see Komenda J 2006 J Biol Chem 281: 1145–1151), it can be both an assembly or repair intermediate. Line 129 - “Atape1” should be written as “The Arabidopsis ape1 mutant” for clarity. Line 229 – “and is not strictly required for their assembly”, I do not agree with that statement, chaperone required for assembly can accumulate to wild type level in absence of the main subunit of a given complex. Line 319 to 325 – Description of partial complementation (lower chla/b in HL and intermediate GPX5 accumulation) and possible explanation (since APE1 protein accumulates to wild type level) should be provided. Line 341 – for this paragraph, it would help the non-initiated to add more introduction on alpha and beta centres and what is meant exactly by “PSII heterogeneity”. Line 573 – The method for generating the mutant library that led to isolation of ape1-1 is missing Line 676 -  Provide amino acid number where the sequence used for recombinant proteins starts Fig1D,E – The data is the same as in the previous submitted version, ape1-1 should say drbcL ape1-1 in Fig1D,F and 1E control is cc-4533. Figure 2B – orientation of protein? please indicate stroma and lumen compartment Fig2C – comment on reason for signal to be lower in isolated thylakoid compared to total cell extracts, usually the opposite occurs, unless APE1 is dual-targeted? Fig4B – comment on more PSI(2) band in ape1 mutant Fig5 – comment on APE1 oligomers. I agree that cross-linking with PSII demonstrates that APE1 is not a free protein but upon solubilization different subcomplexes are resolved, especially in the deltaPSI and deltaPSII mutants. Fig7C – comment on nature of the band right below E and above F enriched in the complemented line. Minor comments Line 147 and other instances – Figures are called twice Line 184 – should read “violaceus” Line 286 – change decorated to probed Line 401 – should read “photoinhibition” Fig6A – annotate nature of B5 and 8 to help reader Fig9 – is this in MIN? how many days?

Indeed upon high light stress, chlorophyll fluorescence quenching is observed attributed to PSII photoinactivation, and this work demonstrates that it stems from PSII reaction center and that degradation of D1 by FtsH is required to relax to an unquenched state. The authors further show that qI formation is more rapid in presence of oxygen but independent of PSII activity (in DCMU) and propose that qI is due to oxidative modification to chlorophyll molecules of PSII reaction center (RC). Accordingly a minimal model was built with qI-ON RC and qI-OFF FtsH-processed/broken RC which successfully fits the experimental data indicating that photoinactivation mechanisms at donor and acceptor sides co-occur. Here are some suggestions/comments. Looking forward to discussion! The first point pertains to semantics, I would suggest using the word “photoinactivation” of PSII instead of “photoinhibition” as much as possible. I was convinced of this idea by Barbara Demmig-Adams when I worked on a review about qH, reserving the term photoinhibition for decrease in CO2 fixation. We proposed a possible new definition for qI that would be quenching due to photoinactivation of D1 rather than due to photoinhibition, as qZ and qH are also photoinhibitory (in that they decrease CO2 fixation). Take a look here, see intro, section 1.1.2. and 4.: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.05.005. Title: I’d suggest a more descriptive title of findings stating where qI stems from, e.g. with oxygen sensitization of D1 as the origin of qI. As is, one could understand the title as qI doesn’t exist (dogma rose and fell kind of idea) but you mean instead molecular origin/mechanism of qI induction and relaxation, right? Throughout text, I’d suggest to use the word “relaxation” instead of “quenching loss”. The word loss is used elsewhere to describe fluorescence decrease i.e. quenching and it can be confusing to have the word “loss” used for both quenching induction and relaxation (e.g. line 94 loss= relaxation; line 96 loss= decrease). I’d also suggest for clarity to use “new synthesis” instead of “repair” (e.g. line 101), as repair encompasses both degradation and new synthesis, it seems confusing to read that qI relaxation is independent of repair but relies on degradation. e.g. Figure 2 title becomes: qI is transient and its relaxation is independent of new D1 synthesis and Figure 3 titles becomes: qI relaxation is due to PSII core proteolysis by FtsH Also for clarity, in title of Figure 1 add - is a quenching “due to energy dissipation”- And line 452 - Using quenching -add “of Fm” - might be beneficial for (f)uture studies Line 202 FtsH-mediated (name of protein uppercase here; not mutant italic lowercase) Line 211 side -> sites There’s a lot of crucially ;-) To go further in the discussion, here are some points that could be interesting to raise: -	Addition of lincomycin blocks synthesis of all chloroplast-encoded proteins, impact on qI formation/relaxation. -	qI relaxation in presence of nuclear gene synthesis inhibitor. -	Slower relaxation of qI in the dark compared to low light (at least after 30min HL). -	qI transient: explanation for differences between strains (e.g. 1009 vs. 124). - ftsh complemented line (in ftsh1-1), comment whether less qI compared to control because more repair enabled; due to higher level of FtsH in that complemented line compared to one in ftsh1-3? -	formation of qI site precedes cleavage (line 242) would need deg mutant to definitely say that. Might be better to say that it precedes D1 degradation (at timepoint 0 there are some D1 fragments, so there has been cleavage already before HL starts). -	damage at acceptor side triggers cleavage in the lumen?

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.25.449905v2#comment-5462653813,biorxivstage,1,"(My peer review no longer appears because it was made on the first version of the article, and it unfortunately did not receive a response before the manuscript was updated. I am thus reposting it here on the second version, hoping for a response. The review is identical to the first one, apart from the comment on the new sequencing data.) With this study, Patterson et al. present a potentially very significant finding: that SARS-CoV-2 antigen persists in non-classical monocytes from Long COVID patients up to 15 months after the initial infection. The data supporting this finding are of moderate to low strength, as presented, primarily due to a wide range of major and minor presentation issues that are listed below. Most of these can be addressed easily, though it is unclear if some additional controls may be required. Finally, some orthogonal approaches are suggested that could be potentially very valuable in terms of increasing confidence in the findings (namely microscopy and immunoblotting), though these are not essential for the interpretation of the results as shown. The authors are to be commended for tackling Long COVID head-on and getting right to the heart of the matter in terms of finding the pathological cause of this disease. That said, unfortunately, this manuscript requires considerable revision in order to be interpretable and allow others to reproduce the findings (which will be of critical importance, given their potential significance). Major issues: - Table 1 and the accompanying text seems to indicate that PBMCs were tested for the presence of viral RNA by ddPCR. However, in the Material/Methods section, it is stated that nucleic acids were extracted from plasma, not from PBMCs. Please clarify this point as it is of critical relevance. Indeed, both plasma and PBMCs should have been individually tested in order to determine whether viral RNA was solely intracellular. - It is very unclear what Figure 2 is presenting. Presumably each row represents a different subject, but it is not denoted which subject belongs to which group, making intepretation very difficult. I presume this was an ommission. - Supplementary Table 1 was not provided, making it very difficult to evaluate the flow cytometry data. Even if that table were present, the methods provided for flow cytometry are very sparse. What steps were undertaken to establish the specificity of the Spike antibody? Was the Spike staining done after fixation and permeabilization? Was PE conjugation of this antibody done in-house, and if so, using which kit, and how was it verified that the conjugation and quenching were successful and that staining was specific within the context of the entire antibody panel? Were FMO controls done in the context of this new panel that includes the S1 antibody? Was Fc block included? etc. - The newly-added sequencing data are difficult to interpret. It seems that the authors interpret the poor sequence coverage as indicative of non-replicating virus and in line with high Ct values, yet they do not seem to comment on the fact that there is nevertheless some seemingly full-length viral genome present in these cells! This is a potentially very important finding and its source will need to be investigated. Additionally, the sequencing results are inconsistent with the PBMC RT-PCR results, where only LH5 was positive, yet LH1-5 all had similar sequence coverage. The names of the samples in Table 2 do not correspond to any other name in this manuscript, clearly they were not renamed as they should have been. In fact, some of these sample names look curiously like name initials, which is a potential study subject data privacy issue. Finally, it does not seem that any healthy controls or previous COVID/non-LH subjects were tested in the same manner, which would be very valuable information. - In general, the Figure Legends are very sparse and should be much more descriptive. Minor/moderate issues: - Table 1 shows that one of the study subjects was asymptomatic. Where is this subject grouped in the subsequent analysis? ALso, ""NS"" is not defined, presumably it means ""nasopharyngeal swab""? - In Figure 2, left column, the CD14/CD16 gates shown were not applied equally from sample to sample. Furthermore, in the middle column it looks like S1+ non-classical cells tend to have a low-SSC profile, while S1- cells have a high-SSC profile that clusters together with intermediate cells. This suggests that the intermediate/non-classical discriminating gates may not have been set appropriately. - The quantification shown in the middle column of Figure 2 is labeled ""CD16+CD14+COVIDS1+"", however no ""CD16+CD14+"" subset is defined. Presumably the authors refer to the aggregate of the ""CD14++CD16+"" intermediate and ""CD14loCD16+"" non-classical subsets. This should be clearly stated as it makes interpretation of the data shown very difficult. Additionally, the quantification is based on the aggregate population, whereas based on the color coding, one would expect individual quantification for each subset. Given the relatively very minor contribution of the intermediate subset to the observed Spike S1 signal, it is unclear why this was included at all in this plot - why not just show the non-classical subset and base the quantification solely based on that, or alternatively, show quantification of each subset rather than their aggregate? - The labeling in Figure 3 could be better, the angled X axis labels are very difficult to follow. Maybe just indicate the monocyte subset as a title above each plot, and/or label each plot as a subfigure? - No information is provided on the statistical analyses done. - I did not look into all the cited work, but in one case (ref. no. 19) was puzzled to see that a review article was cited in which the relevant information was in turn derived from a single primary research article. Surely it makes more sense to just cite that primary research paper rather than the review? General comments: - Why was S1 the only SARS-CoV-2 antigen stained for? One would expect that you would have quickly tried to look for other viral antigens, particularly Nucleocapsid, in order to begin to understand whether there might be virus particles present, especially since you found viral RNA in some samples. Additionally, some microscopy data on sorted non-classical monocytes would have been very valuable to validate what you see by flow cytometry, also because one could then evaluate whether the Spike signal in these cells looks like the expected pattern for protein being actively synthesized by the cell and present on the cell surface, or whether it is captured antigen from some site of viral persistence and is sequestered in some intracellular compartment. Finally, a Western blot for Spike (and other viral antigens) in flow-sorted monocytes would be of immense value to further validate the presence of this antigen and observe the state of the protein - indeed, it is rather odd that you seemingly went for LCMS before trying either microscopy or a Western blot! - The potential connections with the CX3CL1 pathway mentioned in Discussion are very interesting. Unfortunately, the authors have not demonstrated any elevation of CX3CL1 associated with severe acute COVID or long COVID disease, nor the presence of CX3CR1 on the particular cells of interest. If such data exist, please present them, otherwise this Discussion is rather speculative and much more work will be required to frame it in the appropriate context for a primary research paper. Alternatively, this discussion might be better suited for a separate Review article. - Much of the published work on Long COVID and other post-COVID conditions such as MIS-C is omitted here, and should be cited and discussed as appropriate.

The approach claims to work regardless of cell type, species and sequencing assay. There are several things to like about the paper. In particular, the tricycle method is very simple: i) compute the first two PCs on 500 annotated cell-cycle genes in a data set where cell cycle is the primary source of variation; ii) project any future observations to this 2-d embedding and compute the polar angle to predict its cell cycle position. Further, the empirical results are promising. At the same time I think the paper could be substantially improved by removing or reducing some of the less innovative parts, toning down some of the rhetoric, and focussing on the most convincing empirical results. My comments expand on these suggestions. Main comments: 1. I found most of the material on PCA not to be especially novel or interesting. The use of PCA to determine cell cycle position has a long history (including many papers cited here), and existing mathematical results already go far beyond the analysis presented here. The behavior of PCA on cyclic phenomena is much more general than presented here, and does not rely on sinusoidal functions or ""two distinct peaks"" etc. Rather it stems from the result that cyclic phenomona lead to circulant covariance matrices, and all circulant matrices have the same eigenvectors: the columns of the discrete Fourier transform matrix. The result is that, when the covariance patterns primarily reflect cyclic phenomoena, the first two PCs will form a circle/ellipse. See Novembre and Stephens (2008) and references therein for further discussion. Figure 1 is useful for summarizing the method, but most of the other material could be condensed or removed and I think the paper would be improved because it would better focus on what is actually new and interesting, the tricycle method (currently not introduced until p6) and the empirical assessments of its performance. 2. The paper left me asking myself this: what is the strongest empirical support that tricycle cell cycle assignments work in practice? To me, Fig 5 panels c and g are the most convincing, because they are quantitative comparisons with an alternative technology (and one that is often considered the""gold standard"" in this area). I also liked the quantitative comparisons with other methods,  and it seems some of those might be worth including in the main text. In contrast, the results in Fig 4 are not quantitative, and overall not that compelling. The top row of panels are kind of useful in demonstrating you get something like a circle. but we don't actually know that this corresponds to cell cycle from this picture (unless I misunderstood, the colors are inferred, not known). And looking at the mPancreas results one might be tempted to use (-3,0) as the center of the circle, which would change computation of polar angle quite a bit. Is there reason to think that sticking with (0,0) is better? If so, any idea why does the circle show this shift? (Similar issues arise, to a lesser extent, with HippNPC). The Top2A results are, on their own, too noisy to be convincing -- why not show R2 plots for all cell-cycle genes (which could be contrasted with non-cell-cycle genes, and also compared with other methods). And as far as I can see Fig 4c is, at best, only interesting once one is convinced that the cell cycle is being correctly inferred -- nothing here to say that the cell cycle inferences are accurate. To be clear, I'm not saying the method does not generalize well across data sets; I'm saying that the evidence for this needs to be more clearly presented. 3. A less fundamental issue: I don't really think describing this as an example of ""transfer learning"" is helpful. Indeed it is not even clear to me it is accurate. For example, in the cited Pan et al 2008, they describe the transfer learning problem as follows: ""In a transfer learning setting, some labeled data Dsrc are available in a source domain, while only unlabeled data Dtar are available in the target domain."" That does not apply here - everything is based on unlabelled data. More generally, giving the approach a name like ""transfer learning"" seems to suggest that there is something going on to actually make this transfer from one dataset to another, or some deeper theoretical reason to think it should work --  but I don't believe either of these is true. You are just hoping that the PC weights learned in one (carefully chosen) data set will also work to capture cell cycle on other data sets. It isn't obvious in advance that this rather simple approach would work well, and the major contribution of the paper is to assess this empirically. 4. The abstract is hyperbolic.

I am glad you found our manuscript interesting. 1) As per you suggestion, we did check VPD, but there is not much correlation with floral UV patterns. What we see is that floral UV patterns in sunflowers are inversely correlated with both temperature and relative humidity, while VPD increases with temperature and decreases with relative humidity. Our interpretation is that in hot, humid places, preventing over-heating of the ligules through transpiration/evaporative cooling is a priority over reducing water loss (even if VDP might be similar to that of colder, drier places). 2) We did measure flower and ligule size on a subset of ~700 individuals that were grown in the first of our common garden experiments, and there is plenty of variation in flower and ligule size, ligule shape and ligule number (that data is included in a recent paper, Todesco et al., Nature 2020). However, this variation is more difficult to interpret because inflorescence size is very well correlated with flowering time in wild sunflowers (plants that flower later are bigger, and bigger plants make bigger inflorescences). There was extensive variation in flowering time between populations of wild H. annuus in our common garden experiment, with plants flowering anywhere between 30 and more than 130 days after being transplanted. While we can control for when these plants flowered in our common garden, we don’t really know how flowering time in Vancouver translates to flowering time in the location of origin of these plants. Measuring flower/ligule size in situ would be much more informative, but we do not have that data. That said, there is some decent correlation, particularly between relative humidity and relative ligule size (that is, the size of the ligule relative to the size of the whole inflorescence), with plants coming from population with higher humidity having larger ligules. The correlation might be clearer for relative ligule size because it is be less likely to be affected by flowering time/plant size; we use ligule UV proportion (LUVp) to measure floral UV patterns instead of absolute measurements of UV bullseye size exactly for that reason. A previous study from our lab (in H. argophyllus, a different sunflower species) found that in a segregating population, all absolute measures of floral UV pigmentation (e.g. diameter of UV bullseye) mapped to a big flowering time QTL, while LUVp measurements mapped to different regions of the genome (incidentally, in the paper I mentioned before we also confirmed that that QTL in H. argophyllus is indeed due to a well-known flowering time regulator, which was part of a recent large introgression). To sum up, while there is some indication that sunflowers have smaller flowers/ligules in drier climates, it would take in-depth field studies to be able to say something with a modicum of certainty.",2021-07-19T17:21:41,marcotodesco,Marco Todesco,10.1101/2021.06.26.449999,Genetic basis and dual adaptive role of floral pigmentation in sunflowers,"Marco Todesco, Natalia Bercovich, Amy Kim, Ivana Imerovski, Gregory L.

Borgs - another remarkable discovery by Banfield Lab that could illuminate the origin of ancestral viral lineages (1); the other discoveries I have in mind are the huge phages (2) and ARMAN/Thermoplasmatales inter-species connections (3). True to their data, Al-Shayeb et al. (1) seem, at least for a moment, to limit their speculations on the nature and evolutionary origin of Borgs to open questions: “ Are they giant linear viruses or plasmids unlike anything previously reported? Alternatively, are they auxiliary chromosomes? ” Then, to my big surprise, the authors, rather casually, write: “ Perhaps they were once a sibling Methanoperedens lineage that underwent gene loss and established a symbiotic association within Methnoperedens … ” (1). So, why is this a big surprise? Over the last four decades or so, I have been searching for data and observations that are consistent with, or support, the Fusion Hypothesis on the origin and nature of the ancestral or emerging viral linages (4-6). Although, it is clear that the extant viruses originated from other viruses, and there is compelling evidence that the endogenous viral elements, such as transposons and plasmids, originated from exogenous viral lineages, the evolutionary origin of the ancestral viral lineages has remained enigmatic. According to the Fusion Hypothesis, the ancestral viral lineages originated from parasitic cellular organisms, including endo- and ecto-parasites that, to increase their access to the resources present in their environmental niche (i.e. the host cell), fused their cell membrane with the host cell membrane, thereby losing their own cellular organization within the host cell. However, after synthesizing their proteins and other specific molecules and replicating their genome, these novel type of organisms induced the morphogenesis/differentiation of cell-like reproductive forms (i.e. virus particle, or virions), which started a new life cycle by fusing with new host cells. [Metaphorically, the Fusion Hypothesis places the ancestral viruses at the intersection of Hollywood and Greek ‘mythologies,’ in which 'viral Borgs' assimilate their hosts, and reemerge just like Phoenix. Factually, within the host cell, viruses, which have been historically and conceptually misidentified with the virions (4-9), are considered to be in the eclipse phase designated as “ The time between infection by (or induction of) a bacteriophage, or other virus, and the appearance of mature virus within the cell ”(10)]. A fundamental premise of the Fusion Hypothesi s is that only symbiotic/parasitic lineages that have a cellular and molecular composition, and processes compatible with those of their host cells (e.g. an archaeal lineage parasitizing another archaeal lineage) have the opportunity to evolve into a viral lineage (4-6); this implies that bacterial or archaeal lineages parasitizing eukaryotic host cells, for example, are unlikely to be able to evolve into viral lineages, regardless of the degree of their genome/proteome reduction (11). Another intriguing inference from this evolutionary model is that numerous cellular lineages evolved into viral lineages throughout the history of life, and that, remarkably, this process might still be active (5-6). The Fusion Hypothesis is a radical departure from the conventional thinking on the evolutionary origin and nature of ancestral viral lineages, including the historical reductive hypothesis, which lost its appeal more than half of century ago because it could not explain the gradual evolutionary transition from a cellular organisms to viruses (15), which have been conceptually misidentified with the virions and have been erroneously defined based on their physical, biochemical and biological properties (4-9). Perhaps no one has questioned the dogma of viruses as virus particles more explicitly, and in stronger terms, than Jean-Michel Claverie, one of the leading researchers in the field of giant viruses, who asked: “ what if we have totally missed the true nature of (at least some) viruses? ” (8). Claverie answered this intriguing question in a rather revealing way: identifying viruses with the virus particles, he wrote, might “ be a case of ‘when the finger points to the stars, the fool looks at the finger.” (8). Nevertheless, likely, very few readers of this note are familiar with or even heard of these radical perspectives on the origin and nature of viruses. That might change, though, if the researchers realize that, as discussed next, these new perspectives might better explain the existing data and observations and might open new research venues and objectives for grant applications. Fortunately, there are only 2 broad ways of thinking about the evolution of viruses, and these paradigms   could critically inform the hypotheses on the origin and nature of ancestral viral lineages: (i) viruses have evolved and diversified from simple to more complex entities by increasing the size of their genome/proteome/virions, or (ii) vice versa, they have diversified by reductive evolution. The first paradigm supports the hypothesis that the ancestral or incipient viral lineages were simple genetic entities, usually referred as ‘replicons’, which apparently preceded the cellular organisms at the dawn of life (13-14), and the second paradigm supports the hypothesis that the incipient viruses originated from more complex organisms as suggested in the Fusion Hypothesis. Because of the high rate of genome evolution and rampant sequence exchanges among various viruses and their hosts, the current sequence analyses cannot clearly differentiate between the two broad evolutionary pathways. Nevertheless, currently, the hypothesis that the complex viruses have evolved from simpler siblings dominates the literature and discussions in the field (e.g.13-14). This perception, though, is in stark contrast to the well-established fact that all intracellular parasitic or symbiotic microorganisms, which count into thousands of species, have evolved toward a smaller genome/proteome/cell size. Although, similar to their free-living ancestors or relatives, these parasitic and symbiotic cellular organisms do occasionally acquire new genetic material, there is overwhelming evidence that, overall, these species have experienced reductive evolution; and this principle apparently also applies to many free-living species. If this is indeed the case, why would viral lineages evolve in opposite direction? Without addressing this critical question, the dominance of the simple-to-complex hypothesis on the origin and evolution of viruses is questionable. Although, just like any symbiotic/parasitic cellular species, viruses can occasionally increase the size of their genome/proteome (the ‘accordion model’ on viral evolution) it is difficult to define the selective forces leading to the overall evolution of a parasitic organism towards complexity within an intracellular environment. Also, it would be difficult to envision the development of experimental approaches addressing the evolution of ‘replicons’ into simple and, eventually, into more complex viruses; interestingly, Howard Temin’s protovirus hypothesis on the origin of extracellular viruses from endogenous viruses (15) was abandoned when it became clear that the millions of endogenous viruses present in humans and other species originated from exogenous viral lineages, not vice versa. On the contrary, the Fusion Hypothesis on origin and diversification of viral lineages by reductive evolution is consistent with the life cycle of many viruses, which fuse with their host cells to start their intracellular development (4-6). Given the nature of their intracellular environment, which can provide basically unlimited resources, including ribosomes and other components of the metabolic and informational machineries, and considering the dominance of deleterious mutations over those beneficial, as well as the strong selection for increasing their reproductive rate, it is likely that, overall, viruses have experienced reductive evolution. And, very importantly, this reductive evolution is in line with that of all symbiotic and parasitic cellular species. Nevertheless, the huge advantage and appeal of the Fusion Hypothesis is that it can be addressed experimentally in the laboratory using various experimental models (5, 6). Even more thrilling is that, as I previously made the case (5), some parasitic/symbiotic cellular lineages are currently in the process of natural transition from a cellular to a viral type of biological organization. To realign this discussion with Al-Shayeb et al. study and intuition (1), it is likely indeed that the ancestor of the 'colorful Borg' was “ a sibling Methanoperedens lineage that underwent gene loss and established a symbiotic association within Methnoperedens ”, after fusing with it and losing its cellular organization. So are the Borgs viral lineages? To answer this question, we need to add a few more ‘dimensions’ to the Fusion Hypothesis. As I previously discussed (4-5), the paradigm behind this hypothesis is the ‘cellular fusion’ or ‘hybridization’ phenomena. In principle, two cellular organisms can interact and co-evolve in multiple ways: (i) one cell enters the other, keeps its individualizing membrane (i.e. cell-like structure), and integrates its symbiotic life style and life cycle in synchrony with those of the host cell, as has been the case with the mitochondria and chloroplasts lineages; (ii) a parasitic cellular organism enters its host cell, maintains its cellular structure, and after reproduction it leaves the host cell, which is a very common  phenomenon; (iii) a parasitic cellular organism enters the host cell by a membrane fusion mechanism, synthesize its components using the host’s resources, and induce the assembly a cell-like progenies (i.e. virions) that leave the host cell and restart the viral life cycle by fusing with new host cells (iv) in an analogous case, a parasitic cellular organism enters the host cell by a membrane fusion mechanism, ‘assimilates’ the host cell, synthesize its components using the host’s resources and induce the host cell to divide and fuse with other cells, which is another putative viral type of biological organization; (v) and, finally, two related/compatible cellular organisms fuse with each other  (i.e. hybridize), and integrate their metabolism and life cycle, generating a new hybrid organism; likely, this has been a very common phenomenon in the history of life, but because of the integration of the sibling partners, it is difficult to detect. It remains to be seen exactly in which group of biological organization and co-evolutionary pathway the Borgs and their apparent ‘partners,’ the Methanoperedens lineage, fall in, but the discovery of Borgs , and the mystery surrounding their nature and evolutionary origin, should stimulate the interest in developing experimental approaches for addressing the Fusion Hypothesis on the origin of viruses. Additionally, studding the fusion/hybridization of various cellular lineages should open new venues for studying cellular evolution and for dissecting various metabolic and information machineries. I think it is meaningful to end this note with the inspiring remarks by Jill Banfield (16), the senior author of the Al-Shayeb et al. (1) article: “ I repeat- I haven’t been this excited about a discovery since CRISPR. We found something enigmatic that, like CRISPR, is associated with microbial genomes. We have named these unique entities #BORGs. Imagine a strange foreign entity, neither alive nor dead, that assimilates and shares important genes... A floating toolbox, likely full of blueprints, some that we may one day harness, like CRISPR… Wait- wouldn’t that just be a virus? a megaplasmid? a mini-chromosome? No… #BORGs are unique... #BORGs are huge, a third the size of their methane-eating hosts, they have assimilated many metabolism-relevant genes, and they have combinations of features not seen before... #BORGs are like turbo boosters for their host’s methane metabolism. This means they could have significant climate impacts... This discovery started in deep mud and was brought to light by an analysis of around 10 billion DNA snippets. That such an approach could reveal something with potentially global ramifications! In 2021, I will again sit across the table from Jennifer Doudna (@doudnalab) and we will talk about how we might begin to explore the technological and environmental importance of this discovery... This may be an example of the type of basic, discovery-based science that can ultimately tackle the big problems that face our world, the type of discoveries that @elonmusk is seeking through his current 100M @xprize Basic science, starting with fieldwork and looking at what nature has invented, is important if we are to discover things that we could not imagine. This type of science deserves more funding. Without it, the world would not be meeting the #BORGs ” References: 1.	Al-Shayeb et al. 2021.

This was the final version: In this manuscript Classon et al. show that following the intestinal infection with the helminth H.polygyrus (Hp), Hp-specific CD4+ T cells enter the skin and become tissue-resident in the skin. This is an interesting finding. Furthermore, the authors show that the Hp-infected mice have a weaker recall-responses to intra-dermal injection of M. tuberculosis lysate (WCL). However, this point remains observational as no mechanistic explanation is offered. The authors suggest in their discussion that skin-resident Hp-specific Th2 cells would dampen the IFNγ production in response to mycobacterial products locally in the skin, but no data to that effect are shown. Would Hp-specific CD4+ T cells produce IL-4/-13 after WCL, or at least, do more total skin CD4+ T cells do so? How do the authors exclude differences in WCL-induce priming in the skin-draining LNs (rather than local effects in the skin as proposed)? Given that it is known that intestinal helminth infection can dampen immune response at other sites of the body, the novel knowledge gained here appears limited. Moreover, several aspects require attention. M&M section: - The B6 mice were 4-5 weeks of age at the start of the experiment. Can the authors show experimental results that similar data could be obtained with adult mice? - It is not clear if the authors used Fc-block for their flow cytometric staining. - The description of the BM-DCs+WCL cultures is not entirely clear and the experimental procedure is not explained in the main text or figure legends (only M&M), although that would be helpful. The BM-DCs were incubated with WCL over-night, but then the WCL was not washed off, but rather the leukocytes were added, is this correct? In that case a direct impact of WLC on the single cell suspensions from the skin cannot be excluded. What is the reasoning for this approach? This potential confounding factor needs at least be discussed. • Figure 1 - Three of the dot-plots in fig.1b (and in other figures) do not show any dots. The authors should use density plots with outliers for all flow cytometry dot-plot data throughout the manuscript (including the supplements). - To the legend: (i) “Representative FACS plots illustrating the gating strategy” - the link to the supplement is missing; (ii) “BMDCs expressing WCL overnight“ - the DCs to not express WCL, they were incubated with it o/n, right?; - Why is the y-axis as CD4+ cells when the cells were gated for T cells? Writing ‘CD4+ T cells’ appears more appropriate. - The figure SF1b suggests that most of the cells purified from the ear are dead. Is this also the case for the CD45+ cells? Is the frequency of dead CD45+ skin cells comparable between the groups? What is the author’s argument that this would not skew the results? • Figure 2 - The authors treated the mice twice for one week with DSS, which did not lead to changes in the numbers of CD4+ T cells in the skin. However, 2 weeks after the Hp infection there was no such difference either. Therefore, the conclusion that bacterial translocation does not lead to increased CD4+ T cells frequency in the skin cannot be made based on this DSS-timing alone. Furthermore, the levels of translocation (with Hp or DSS) would need to be comparable to make such conclusions even with identical timing. However, the sCD14-levels were not measured following the DSS treatment. In either case, the DSS-experiment is in its current form not sufficient to exclude the possibility that bacterial translocation is not involved in the skin homing. However, to this reviewer, excluding this option is a minor point that does not appear essential. - It is not clear to this reviewer why the cohousing of the dewormed mice with the chronically infected mice would not lead to reinfection. - As the experiment in fig.2j has only been performed once, the results are preliminary and should be moved to the supplements and the text should reflect the preliminary nature of the data. Furthermore, the relative percentage of CD4+ T cells should be given, additional to the numbers. - The figure legend lists figures n-p (for the replicates), which are not shown. Furthermore, the abbreviation ‘Dw’ is not explained. Please adjust. • Figure 4 - For figures 4h+i the authors claim that the difference “was more pronounced in H. polygyrus-infected mice”. It is not clear how the authors arrive at this conclusion. Obviously, the difference in the p-values that compare ST2-pos and -neg cells is meaningless in this regard. One would need to perform an Anova analysis of the control groups (ST2-pos/-neg) vs. the Hp-infected groups. It appears, however, that this was not done. Please do so and include the values or adjust the language. - Furthermore, even if the Anova indicates a difference between controls and infected mice, the claim that “TH2 cells … especially targeted to the skin in worm-infected mice” cannot be kept, as the authors did not check other organs to see if this migration is specific to the skin. - Finally; the statement “ST2+ cells expressed higher levels of CCR4 and CCR10 … compared to ST2-cells” does only hold true for CCR4, not CCR10. The authors should be more careful not to claim things in the text that are not supported by their data. - The IL-4 cytokine increase in the ICCS appears questionable. A second method to identify IL-4 production should be included. • Figure 5 - The authors wanted to show “the reactivity of skin-localized CD4+ T cells … and … analysed cytokine mRNA expression”. Obviously, the total-tissue mRNA response cannot be linked to a particular cell and does not show actual cytokines. This requires protein data on a single cell level. This applies similarly to suppl.fig.5 for which the authors claim in the text to have tested ‘cytokines’ when they actually only checked the mRNA. - The statement “CD4+ cells that accumulate in the skin of infected mice are H. polygyrus-specific” is not supported by the provided data as the authors did not clarify if indeed the majority of the accumulating skin CD4+ T cells are Hp-antigen-specific. All that can be said, is that the skin CD4+ T cells contained some antigen-specific cells. Either their relative frequency needs to be established or the claim in the text needs to be removed. - Similar, the data with N.  brasiliensis cannot indicated that the skin CD4+ T cells were Hp-specific. All that this result indicate is that the resident CD4+ T cells are not cross-reactive against N. brasiliensis.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.22.445292v2#comment-5457667960,biorxivstage,1,"The manuscript entitled “Simultaneous pure T2 and varying T2′-weighted BOLD fMRI using Echo Planar Time-resolved Imaging for mapping cortical-depth dependent responses” used a recently described sequence approach of flexible k-t sampling to capture the signal evolution during T2* and T2 decay. This sampling strategy is applied with a combination of high spatial resolutions as well as an advanced subspace reconstruction. The mitigation of T2’ weighting is used to extract functional layer-dependent activation scores with minimal sensitivity to unwanted large draining veins. This manuscript augments the long list of layer-fMRI acquisition approaches that aim to minimise unwanted signal of locally unspecific large draining veins. This manuscript stands out in its beautifully efficient exploitation of redundancies in the ky-t space and careful multi-segment combinations. Efficient sampling of depth-dependent signals without vascular biases is one of the most important problems of the emerging field of layer-fMRI. Thus, I expect that this manuscript is of the uttermost interest to a large readership. The authors have previously used EPTI for similar gradient-echo-spin-echo experiments for the purpose of quantitative T2* and T2 mapping as well at GE-fMRI ( https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm... and has been further improved with subspace reconstructions ( https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.... Here they apply these technical advancements to the domain of high-resolution fMRI. This study confirms what previous non-human animal literature has shown. Namely, single-shot SE-EPI is contaminated by unwanted T2’ contrasts. The presented method can mitigate this contamination by synthesizing undersampled ky-t data at the TE that would be free of T2’ effects. I am extremely enthusiastic about this study and look forward to seeing it published. There are a few minor points that the manuscript could be improved on: 1.) I think the limits of exploiting the temporal correlation in ky-t space are not fully discussed. The experiments use a ky-t matrix of 144 (phase lines) x 45 (echoes). This means that the ky-t space contains 6480 data points. This is a large space! With three segments used in this study, this means that only one out of 48 data points is sampled. That’s a large undersampling factor that needs to rely on a lot of redundancy across time and coils. Thus, I find the (schematic) figure 1B a bit misleading. It seems to suggest that the ky-t space is relatively densely sampled (it suggests a 8 fold denser sampling than the one that is applied). In my understanding there are literally only three data points acquired at the exact TE of a pure spin echo. The remaining 141 data points are reconstructed by means of data points that suffer from a T2’ contamination. Thus, I find the term “pure” spin echo to be a bit of an overstatement. I appreciate that the PCA in the subspace reconstruction can act like a T2’-model, but it is not clear to me to what degree this still works? Another way of phrasing my point is asking: Why did the authors choose to use three segments? If there wouldn’t be any limits about the T2’ contamination they could have used two or just one segment, right? Would the pure spin echo be even purer for 10 segments? If the authors agree, I would suggest manuscript changes along the following: 1.a)  Line 15 on page 7 reads: “we tailor this subspace reconstruction specifically to the SE-EPTI acquisition”. I would suggest providing more details about what was specifically done to tailor it? Does it go beyond what is described in (Dong et al., 2020). 1.b)  Lines 19-20 on page 19 state: “we do not rule out the possibility that there might be some T2′ contrast leakage”. I would encourage the authors to rephrase this double negative into a more specific statement. Maybe the authors can even aim to quantify the amount of T2’ contamination? Or at least make a rough estimate about the order of magnitude of this effect? 1.c)  Maybe, and only if the authors agree, they could think about paraphrasing the term “pure” in pure spin echo. E.g. in the discussion section they seem to use the term “purer” spin echo here and there. 2.) There are a few parallel efforts of obtaining a “pure” spin-echo in multiple other layer-fMRI labs (VA in San Francisco, Nijmegen/Essen, Johns Hopkins etc.). Those laps seem to use an alternative approach of T2-prep pulses. If the authors think this is closely enough related to their work, maybe it would be appropriate to very briefly mention these efforts too? Already published work on T2-prep layer-fMRI contain: Pfaffenrot V, Voelker MN, Kashyap S, Koopmans PJ. Laminar fMRI using T2-prepared multi-echo FLASH. Neuroimage. 2021;(February):118163. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118163 Fig. S4 in Huber L, Handwerker DA, Jangraw DC, et al.

Lines 8-9 on page 12 state: “the EPTI-extracted EPI images were generated after removing the B0 phase in the full k-t data (not possible with conventional EPI data)”. I find it always hard to claim that something would not be possible. Maybe the authors can add the common “without further ado”? The temporal correlation in the ky-t space should be there in conventional EPI too. Which can (and has been) harvested for B0-phases.

I would commend the authors for the meticulous work and large data sets; very impressive. I have carefully read the manuscript and some questions and comments came up, to which I hope the authors could provide some clarification, or might consider the authors to revise their work. I have listed them below. Hopefully, the authors would be able to respond: 1.	A general comment is that the resolution of many of the figures appears quite low, limiting their interpretation. 2.	On lines 88-90 as well as lines 589-600, the authors claim that their work is the first to have used single cells analysis of IVD. I do not believe this claim is correct, in particular as the authors used previously published single-cell data of NPCs to establish their own NPC population types? (paragraph from line 389) 3.	Why did the authors choose to classify the degeneration grade as I-IV for the Pfirrmann grades II-V? This seems a bit misleading; potentially leading to the false impression for some that healthy IVD tissue was employed? 4.	Also, the authors claim that they were obtained 2 samples from patients with LDH graded as Pfirrmann grade 5; How would such far advanced degenerative disc, still classify as LDH? 5.	For me the methods were not fully clear on the tissues used for experiments other than the scRNA-seq? Is it correct that the 8 tissue samples available for RNAseq were all concurrently used for immunohistochemistry FACS, and in vitro culture experiments? How were the authors able to proceed with performing all the experiments from this limited number of samples? Were cells cultured prior to the experiments? I would hope the authors can clarify this aspect. 6.	The authors claim that their work is aiming to look at the changes of the subpopulations with the progression of disc degeneration. Although the authors are able to include samples of different Pfirrmann grades, the majority of the samples were obtained from LDH pathologies. LDH involves rupture of the AF opening up the NP and thereby subjecting it to vascularization etc. I would suggest this aspect should be considered in the aim and title of the manuscript as well as discussed as a limitation. Particularly in consideration with the inflammatory/immunogenic cell population recognized in the NP tissue. 7.	With the previous in mind, currently the authors only report on the change in cell phenotypes for the NPC-classification. How did the GMPs, neutrophils, MDSCs, T-, B-, Plasma, and NK-cell populations change with the progression of degeneration in the LDH samples? Could this data be included in the manuscript? 8.	For the results from figure 1, the authors obtained NPCs from LDH samples, including highly (Pfirrmann grade V) discs. Generally, the pathology is hallmarked by the influx of blood vessels and neurons. Could the authors explain why no clusters of endothelial or neuronal cells were identified in the process? 9.	For the IRB approval, could the authors include the application or approval number for both the animal experimentation and human-tissue collection of the study? 10.	Generally, the methods contain a lot of reagents and equipment for which no manufacturer or concentration/volumes are provided. 11.	The methods also seem to miss a clear description of the statistics applied for each of the different experiments, as well as which values were included or considered as statistically significant. 12.	For figure 1B, D, and F the inconsistency in colors is rather confusing; I think the readability could be enhanced if colors are consistently applied for the different types of subtypes. (particularly as D and F) 13.	Also for figure 1F, a color-map range legend is included that does not seem to apply to the graph? I believe this should be part of G? 14.	One of the limitations for the analysis of figure 2C is that any increase or decrease seen from Pfirrmann II samples to III – V, as that it also involves a stark contrast of burst fracture vs LDH samples; to what extent can these changes really be explained through an increase in Pfirrmann grades? If we only compare the changes in cell populations from Pfirrmann grade III-V; there appear very limited differences between the types of cells present in the NP? 15.	For figure 2E; the authors confirmed the presence of some of the markers used for the identification of the different NPC populations predicted on expression profiles. However, for me, it was not clear on which type of tissue(s) the IHC was performed? Also, why did the authors not quantify the rate of cell positivity in the different degenerations stages to further validate the predicted changes? 16.	The main issue I have with the manuscript is the conclusion of the authors that the FIB-NPCs present a “regenerative” and progenitor cell population in the NPC, even though both consensus suggests fibroblastic NPCs tend to present end-stage NPCs and the authors own data indicates as such; e.g. (1) Fig3A; Fib NPCs are active in catabolic ECM/collagen production, collagen fibril organization, (2) Fig 3E; activity in Angiogenesis (and innervation), (3) Fig 3F; high activity in senescence and SASP, (4) Fig 4I; associated with high apoptosis etc. and inflammasome, (5) Fig 2B the high expression (marker) of COL1A1, MMP2, etc., (6) Fig 3A very low MSC proliferation. All these aspects of the Fib NPCs population seem to suggest a catabolic, end-stage degenerative NPCs population. Not to mention the general consensus in the field that a fibroblastic phenotype presenting NPC being held responsible for the catabolism of the IVD; ( doi.org/10.1371/journal.pon..., https://doi.org/10.1002/jsp..., https://doi.org/10.22603/ss...) The authors suggest the Fib NPC population as a progenitor and regenerative population-based on (1) the expression of CD90; as this is classified as an MSC marker; however, (2) the multipotent differentiation, (3) the lineage trajectory predictions (fig 4, S3) suggesting that Fib NPC give rise to the other cell types, (4) the Fib NPCs have a high association with apoptosis, (5) the Fib NPCs are involved in stimulating angiogenesis. The argument in favor of the hypothesis that Fib NPC present a regenerative progenitor cells population seems rather pre-mature and one-sided. For example, the notion that the Fib NPCs have multilineage differentiation abilities is not fully supported by the current data as the authors only show the multilineage differentiation of the CD90+ FIB NPCs, but did not repeat the experiment of general NPCs or non-CD90+ cells. Moreover, it has already been reported that hNP cells, in general, have multilineage differentiation potential (If would for example refer to https://doi.org/10.1002/jsp....  The fact that the Fib NPCs present high levels of apoptosis also seem precarious, as cell death is part of pluripotency but also linked to cell senesce and inflammation; why would the authors favor the pluripotency hypothesis, while all the other data highlight the catabolic nature of the fib NPCs. Same for the claim that angiogenesis is a regenerative outcome for the IVD, while in general, it similarly associates with degeneration for the disc. I would suggest the authors revisit this hypothesis or at least be more nuanced about their claims. 17.	Going back to my previous comment, the results from figure 4E have very little meaning without a negative control to support the notion that specifically, the CD90+ Fib NPC population has the capacity of multilineage differentiation. 18.	Also, for the Figure 3S and Figure 4 outcomes, the trajectory as suggested by the authors indicate that the Fib NPC gives rise to adhesion/effector NPCs/etc, which then gives rise to homeostatic NPCs. I am not all too familiar with these algorithms, however, would it not be possible that the order of the trajectory might be correct, however, the direction of the trajectory is reversed? I.e. reversing the trajectory from Homeostatic NPCs to finally fibro NPCs would concur much better with the consensus in the literature? 19.	The authors chose to validate their CD24+ MDSC phenotype using a puncture-induced disc degeneration model; Why did the authors make this specific decision? I see some specific issues with the model applied; (1) the different (notochordal) cell population that overall has much higher regenerative potential (2) the degeneration type involving acute degenerative damage compared to chronic LDH, (3) the high levels of CD24 positive cells among these rats notochordal/NP cells ( doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.... 20.	With the previous in mind, the CD11b, OLR1, and CD24 staining performed for figure 5, does not seem to confirm the author's hypothesis that CD24 positive G-MDSCs are present, as from my observation, no overlap of CD24 can be detected with CD11b/OLR1 positive cells? 21.	For figure 5; could the authors quantify the positivity rates of the single, triple, and negative cells within the different obtained samples?! 22.	Same goes for the CD90+ cells; could the location of these cells be quantified? 23.	Moreover, OLR1 and CD11b are supposed to be membrane proteins yet the staining seems to suggest these proteins are present within the nucleus? Can the authors confirm the specificity of the staining? 24.	For fig S5B; the authors present Tie2 and GD2 expressing cell populations however, the UMAP does not seem to match any of the other cluster graphs. Do the authors have any data to indicate which type of NPC population showed high Tie2 and/or GD2 expression? 25.	In general, the figure legends are quite limited in their description of the images and graphs included. 26.	I am generally missing a discussion on the types of classifications and regulatory pathways identified in this study, in relationship with other studies employing sc-RNAseq of NPCs; e..g. doi.org/10.3390/ijms22094917, 10.1038/s41598-020-72261-7 , etc. It would be interesting to see how the authors place their work concerning other works examining the single-cell RNA profiles. 27.

The manuscript also provides multiple perspectives: (1) assessment of brain-behavior CCA & PLS when sample sizes change for the number of features, (2) a meta-analysis/review of brain-behavior CCA studies, and (3) tools, suggestions, and advice on how to approach interpretation of CCA & PLS-based studies for brain-behavior neuroimaging studies. There is a substantial amount of work and the contributions of the manuscript are quite valuable. Overall I think this is a strong manuscript and there are many good things about this paper and the software. However I focus my review on my concerns. I think if some of these are clarified or responded to, then the paper would possibly be stronger and clearer. Below I first bullet point my primary concerns with the manuscript, and how those concerns relate to the overall conclusions and generalizability of the work. Following that, I provide my other concerns generally in order of appearance in the manuscript. My first major concern is that the manuscript generally reads as potential limitations of CCA and PLS. However, only these two methods are discussed and, I believe, that the core issues of stability (and generalizability, replicability, etc…) in neuroimaging are because of (1) small samples, and (2) noisy measurements. So are the issues presented exclusive to CCA/PLS? Or should we expect to see the same effects in other techniques (e.g., standard GLMs, multivariate regressions, statistical/machine learning approaches such as SVM or random forests)? While comparing CCA and PLS is (very, very) useful for many fields, especially neuroimaging, I believe that some of the comparisons here are in effect unfair. In particular, CCA doesn’t really work without extra preprocessing to data when those data have more variables than samples. CCA effectively requires us to reduce the dimensionality of data so that we have more samples than variables or to allow us to invert X’X and/or Y’Y. However, PLS does not require additional preprocessing in order to work (correctly). The pipelines for the data were designed around the limitations of CCA but applied to both PLS and CCA. How does PLS perform when these extra steps are not taken? Effectively, how does PLS vs. PLS with CCA-friendly data vs. CCA compare? Though I comment on it more later, I believe that the observed “bias towards the first principal components” in the PLS results may be due to this. Taken together, I think the general conclusion to take away from the manuscript is that these are the behaviors and limitations of CCA/PLS under these specific conditions, but not necessarily any condition. I expand on this in additional comments and provide some references throughout. Abstract: You’ve noted that the “Application of CCA/PLS to high-dimensional datasets raises critical questions about reliability and interpretability”. Perhaps a small but important distinction here is that these techniques provide a lot of things to interpret, but comparatively are relatively easy to interpret (they are interpreted like PCA). I think there should be a de-emphasis of interpretability and most of the emphasis on reliability and stability. To note: these techniques are still easy to interpret even when results are not reliable (which is, perhaps, a drawback of their use). I apologize for the following comment as it will be repeated a few more times, but I believe that “For PLS [there is a] bias toward leading principal component axes.” is more likely an artifact of how the data were prepared for use in PLS and not strictly a drawback of PLS. If both X and Y data sets are principal components (which include their subsequently decreasing variance), then PLS will (correctly) pick up on those “variables” (components). This is particularly true if/when data submitted to PLS are not normed or scaled in some way (which principal components are likely not, as that destroys the inherent variance in the principal components). Introduction: I think “the dominant latent patterns of association linking individual variation in behavioral features to variation in neural features” would be better rephrased as “the dominant common latent patterns shared between behavioral and neural features”. Or something along these lines as it’s a bit clearer and doesn’t emphasis linking one thing to another thing (as this sounds a bit directional, where CCA and this flavor of PLS is symmetric) When you say “[...] a number of open challenges exist regarding [CCA/PLS] stability in characteristic regimes of dataset properties”, I wonder if it’s more appropriate to also discuss the open challenges of the data themselves. Noisy instruments and measurements are difficult to analyze with most approaches, and this isn’t a problem for just CCA and PLS. In effect, do we have data that are stable and reliable? I find the mixtures of terminology difficult to follow. Could you provide a clearer set of definitions for terminology, and then stick specifically to certain terms? You’ve mentioned both the SVD and eigendecompositions. It might make things clearer to connect CCA & PLS terminology directly to SVD/eigen results, and just use those terms instead. For one particularly confusing example: “weights”. I’m not sure what “weights” are to mean here, especially because “weights” has so many meanings in stats/machine learning. I think the discussions of stability rely too heavily on relatively older literature (e.g., references 10-12) which are also generally from other domains. The same points from those are likely still true (or even more so in larger and noisier data) but I think more modern works that directly discuss high dimensional problems would be helpful. Furthermore, these generally discuss CCA and not PLS. So additional literature on PLS here would be good. For reference 13, the manuscript says “cross-validated association strengths that are markedly lower than in-sample estimates”. Isn’t that expected based on this (and other) work? Should we not expect the smaller sample sizes (e.g., folds) to produce lower (or less stable) estimates? To echo a previous point: most of the literature discussing (in)stability is for CCA and not PLS. This should be clarified or further supported. Though this work is important and well done, I don’t think it’s fair to say “to our knowledge, no framework exists [...]”. There has been a lot of work on the systematic assessment of these techniques, and the SVD/eigen in general. Could you clarify this a bit more? Or instead show that this is an additional element in our understanding of CCA/PLS behaviors? The field of chemometrics in particular has an extensive literature on the stability of PLS (although typically the regression flavor, not the PLSC flavor here). I think this is misleading and possibly incorrect: “CCA and PLS differed in their dependences and robustness, in part due to PLS exhibiting a detrimental bias of weights toward principal axes”. PLS may exhibit this behavior under these data processing conditions (which are required for CCA, but not for PLS). Another repeated point: the manuscript says that “typical CCA/PLS studies in neuroimaging are prone to  instability”. Is this because of CCA/PLS? Are other techniques also unstable? Is this because of the data? Results: “Number of features” as the additive number between X and Y is strange, because each set has a different number of features. And the sizes of X and Y (as well as their internal covariance structures) can have substantial influence on the results. For example, if X were only 1 or 2 (strongly correlated) measures and Y had many 100s or 1000s of measures, then the (joint) solution is fairly limited and (to a degree) constrained by X. The finding of the “average of the cross-validated and in-sample” results struck me, especially given that the bootstrapped results didn’t converge to the expected estimate (but the previous average did). I didn’t expect this, but I think it’s a positive finding. Could you provide more details on these procedures, and could you possibly explain these behaviors/findings in more detail? Why are you quantifying error as the greater of the two errors (X and Y) from their true weights? Why not present them separately? That would tell us if/how CCA/PLS can estimate one set but perhaps not the other. I don’t follow what the authors did to get around the sign-flips in the results. The manuscript says “it is chosen to obtain a positive between-set correlation”, but I’m not sure what this means here. To repeat a previous point about terminology: the term “loadings” has many meanings, too. Here it seems the authors used the correlation between datasets and scores, correct? These correlation loadings are one type of loading, where, say, the singular/eigen vectors are another type of loading. Why switch between Spearman and Pearson correlations for the distance estimate for the various scores? Why not both in both cases or choosing one? I find Figure 3---in particular panels A and B---unclear. First, it’s not entirely clear to me what “weights” and “feature id” convey here. Figure 3B seems to show that PLS weights are spherical. This is not what I would expect from PLS. Could you explain these results in more detail? A reiterated point: The description of what it means for PLS to converge to “the first principal component” is unclear. The first principal component of what? There are two data sets (X, Y) that are sets of PCs (if I am understanding correctly). I think the permutation tests may be too conservative and/or incorrect (as described in CCA/PLS analysis of empirical data). While it is typical to permute just the rows of one matrix vs. the other, this is potentially problematic for CCA/PLS. That’s because each X & Y has an internal covariance structure. If at least one of those structures is strong, then the results will resemble the strong internal structure. This is particularly true when, for example, behavioral data are already very correlated. So a more appropriate permutation may be within each column of the data matrices. However, this is only appropriate in the original data matrices. Permutation should not be done on the PC scores (I am presuming that was the case, but please correct me if I am wrong). For the line that starts with “After modality-specific preprocessing (see Methods)”, I will reiterate and expand on one of my sticking points. CCA requires invertible or rank reduced matrices when there are too many variables but PLS does not. So to reduce specifically to 100 PCs is a limitation of CCA. PLS does not require this. How would the results change if PLS were run directly on the data? Furthermore, 100 principal components is not informative nor a meaningful choice. How many total components were there? How much variance did 100 components explain? Could just 10 or 20 components explain almost as much variance as 100? For analyses based on PCs, it is important to select based on something meaningful: that could be explained variance or by performing tests on the PCs themselves for selection. Though almost any approach is somewhat arbitrary, to select 100 is seemingly unmotivated or unguided. In Figure 4, how are you computing 95% CIs from permutations? Permuations are for null distributions, not distributions around the effects (CIs). I would expect other resampling approaches (e.g., bootstrap) to provide CIs. By the time I get to Figure 4, I’m wondering why are the CCA and PLS results not directly compared? As in, why not present, for examples, correlations or other similarities between the CCA & PLS results? I think it would be important to directly quantify the similarity between CCA & PLS results. Later in the manuscript, you indicate that you “considered reducing the data to different numbers of principal components than 100.” While this is certainly a benefit, the description of the results is unclear. You indicate that “Retaining more than 10 behavioral PCs lead to marginal increases [...]”. But 10 here is not informative. How much variance was explained by those 10? By the 100? How much is explained by 1 PC? The total number of PCs is not particularly informative, rather, the amount of (cumulative) explained variance, the number of retained components, and the total number of possible components makes for something more informative. Discussion: The authors mention that CCA is (more) attractive (than PLS) because it’s scale invariant, which is nice when measures are not commensurate. However, when data are normalized or scaled (e.g., z-scored), then data are commensurate. Did you use normed or scaled data for PLS? How would that change the conclusions about commensurate scales and CCA’s scale invariance? You mention in limitations that you “assume data are described in a PC basis” and then you “expect that a dataset whose features have been rotated into a new coordinate system by an orthogonal transformation matrix to have the same sample size requirements as the untransformed dataset.” In this particular case for PLS: you don’t need to assume that. You can run the same pipelines you have with the untransformed data to see how CCA vs. PLS vs. (untransformed) PLS compare. This would provide a very interesting case regardless of the results (whether the sample size requirements are the same or different). You say that the generative model points out the pitfalls of CCA and PLS. Could you also apply this generative approach to other techniques, even simple linear models? Do the pitfalls also exist there? Are these pitfalls of the methods, or are these pitfalls reflective of the kinds of data we analyze? You note that there are regularized versions of CCA and PLS to “mitigate the problem of small sample sizes”. I have two issues (one small, one a bit bigger) with this statement. Regularized (and penalized, and sparsified, etc…) methods are not necessarily designed to allow for small sample sizes. Rather they help with mitigating overfitting (which sometimes could be due to too small of sample). My second issue is that the line between CCA and PLS becomes especially blurred, and even disappears, when it comes to regularized techniques. In particular, we should look to Witten et al.’s penalized approach for CCA. Witten et al., note that “[in] high dimensional problems, treating the covariance matrix as diagonal can yield good results” where they reframe their CCA equation (4.2) and in a different way, where their “penalized CCA criterion, [they] substitute in the identity matrix” for X’X and Y’Y in their equation 4.3. Witten et al., then further note that their CCA “is simply [eq. 2.7] with X replaced with X'Y”. That means that when it comes to penalized CCAs, most drift towards or even start out as PLS. This can make any suggestions as to which is better (CCA or PLS) moot as in the penalized approaches, they are effectively much closer to one another than in the standard approaches. (Furthermore, using a subset of PCs for each data set is, effectively, a soft form of regularization.) Though brief, I think you’ve placed too much emphasis on PLS regression as being “conceptually different from PLSC/PLS-SVD” because in virtually all implementations of PLS regression, the first component/latent variable is identical to PLSC’s first component/latent variable. This is because both approaches model X’Y and (in most cases) use the SVD to do so. It’s just that PLSC is one pass of the SVD (so effectively a PCA of X’Y) where as PLSR is iterative, deflates X and Y in each iteration, and (asymmetrically) emphasizes certain properties for X (e.g., orthogonal latent variables for X, but not necessarily Y). Methods: The approach to the behavioral data is not particularly realistic when it comes to studies, is it? In most cases some form of imputation would be used and the behavioral data in particular would be directly used, not a projection (PCs) of the data. Would the behavioral PCs change substantially in your pipeline if you were to impute instead of using the method you did? References and literature: Below I provide some references and literature to supplement some of my points and to help strengthen some of the points you’ve made in the paper. Please note that some are mine. I’m not providing my (or the other) citations because I want them to be or am expecting them to be cited, rather these are for reference. Furthermore, these articles also provide quite a bit of citations that are worth looking into. These two articles provide more unified perspectives on PLS, CCA, and many related techniques. The Borga et al., article is quite a good one. I provide my article moreso for the supplemental materials ( https://www.biorxiv.org/con.... In my supplemental materials, I further unify and generalize more approaches like the Borga article. Both of these show (at least algebraically) that these techniques can be thought of as variations of one another, and in some cases not very different. Borga, M., Landelius, T., & Knutsson, H.

To further emphasize why CCA/PLS can be very different or very similar, please see another one of my articles (see below). Like above, most of this article can just be skipped. Starting in section 4 on Page 22, I show CCA, PLS, and reduced rank regression (RRR) because they are all variants of one another. In Figure 5 the data are centered and scaled, and each technique produces comparable results. In Figure 7, however, the data are only centered and produce different results. This highlights that when norming/scaling, CCA and PLS can in fact be more similar than different: Beaton, D. (2020). Generalized eigen, singular value, and partial least squares decompositions: The GSVD package. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.14734. Some recent work has been published to show what happens to results when sample sizes are small and as sample sizes change: Grady, C. L., Rieck, J. R., Nichol, D., Rodrigue, K. M., & Kennedy, K. M. (2021). Influence of sample size and analytic approach on stability and interpretation of brain‐behavior correlations in task‐related fMRI data. Human brain mapping, 42(1), 204-219. The above article is an interesting companion to yours because it shows that there is an advantage to multivariate over univariate techniques because multivariate approaches provide consistent (stable) results. However, Grady et al., concluded that small samples wouldn’t be sufficient to get reliable results, regardless of approach.

I had two comments that might be interesting to y'all: 1. Given the importance of temperature and relative humidity, perhaps Vapor Pressure Deficit is the environmental variable that is best explaining some of the relationships observed. 2. Along the same lines, if ligules are potentially costly due to evapotranspiration, then perhaps there is morphological plasticity in the size/shape of the ligules. Just as Specific Leaf Area varies with environmental conditions, perhaps so does ligule specific area (Ligule area/ligule dry weight)? I would be curious about the intraspecific variation in ligule shape in addition to pigmentation in response to environmental conditions.",2021-07-13T17:43:13,nate_emery,Nate Emery,10.1101/2021.06.26.449999,Genetic basis and dual adaptive role of floral pigmentation in sunflowers,"Marco Todesco, Natalia Bercovich, Amy Kim, Ivana Imerovski, Gregory L.

We particularly appreciated the analysis vignettes with strep pnuemo and staph aureus. We started experimenting with it last week as it provides a nice addition to one of our current studies. We do have a couple practical questions about ""best practices""... 1) Are there any considerations for how the initial time-scaled tree is inferred?  For example, if you performed model testing with BEAST and found that a skygrid demographic model with relaxed clock best fit, would this violate the underlying assumption of constant background population size?  In this scenario, would it correctly identify the expanding lineages but underestimate the effective population size of the expansion?  Would a better approach be to infer an initial tree using a relaxed clock and constant population size? 2) Regarding the analysis of SPN, are there any thoughts to how recombination would impact the performance of the tool? I am less concerned about ancestral recombination that is generally shared by all members of the population of interest. However, if the expansion of a lineage was associated with a recombination event (e.g., a capsule switch in pneumo or even just a large recombination block impacting protein antigens), how would that bias the detection of the expansion or the population size in relation to the background? (We can assume these events were detected and censored before coalescent analysis) I don't expect endless simulations to address all the different possible population dynamics, but I think some comments about the recombination questions would be of general interest to those of us that work on highly recombining bacteria.

In this case, the relative low level of pdgfra is not particularly useful to identify pri-OPC. We really appreciate that you bring that up. At this stage, we still think this is subpopulation (number 11) is pri-OPC, since it was enriched for the OPC markers sox10 and nkx2.2, as well as progenitor or precursor markers including hes6, btg2, and ppp1r14bb (Figure 3B-D, F). We are also working on the single cell sequencing at later stage, when OPC will show up.

But the discussion of parallels with work in flies on a TDP-43 model (reference 102, Kim et al. 2014, PMID: 24336168), fails to take into account the fact that in flies it was EIF2AK3, encoding PERK, whose genetic or pharmacological inactivation led to amelioration of the phenotype (not EIF2AK2 as noted in error here). This does not undermine the operational conclusion that less ISR may be better in ALS/FTD, but it suggests that the driver(s) of enhanced eIF2a phosphorylation in ALS/FTD may be rather diverse and indirect, as the biochemical process that drives EIF2AK2/PKR activity and EIF2AK3/PERK activity are very different.",2021-07-10T11:41:20,disqus_JNVBDeaHLu,David Ron,10.1101/2021.07.07.451374,Single-cell profiling of the human primary motor cortex in ALS and FTLD,"S.
