The novel approach to defining fibrosis in post-MI models is so interesting, and is a great build upon your previous findings. The mathematical modeling of cold vs. hot fibrosis was an impressive approach. A couple comments regarding the experimental approach: 1 - Considering how different myocardial infarction progresses in male and female humans, and how differently each sex responds post-MI, the lack of differentiation between sexes in the murine and porcine models was concerning. All kinds of factors related to sex can influence post-MI condition, and identifying samples by sex may have explained some of the variability (as seen in Figure 2E). 2 - While the GO analysis refinement of the bulk RNA-seq data is intriguing and provokes question of further study, establishing continuity in using scRNA-seq for both the murine and porcine models would have made for a better comparison of the data. 3 - The UMAP in Supplemental Figure 1A shows a much different gene expression profile in the fibroblasts and myofibroblasts at the end of the healing period in comparison with the early healing period. This would suggest that the ending fibroblasts have much a different identity in comparison to the starting ones, and calls into question whether the two populations can be deemed to be the same. Perhaps further study into differential gene expression of these two populations could be beneficial to the project.",2023-03-16T01:54:59,helenthome,HELEN THOME,10.1101/2023.01.01.522422,Circuit to target approach defines an autocrine myofibroblast loop that drives cardiac fibrosis,"Shoval Miyara, Miri Adler, Elad Bassat, Yalin Divinsky, Kfir B.

Two other datasets, including one containing 700 representative prokaryotic proteomes constructed by Moody et al. (2022) and another containing several novel hgc-carriers published by Lin et al. (2021), were retrieved and incorporated into the RP75 dataset. Totally 169 HgcA sequences were collected after removing redundancies Comment: I might have missed something, but it appears that you have included hgcAB sequences that are either included in the PF03599 protein family or MAGs from Lin et al. Are the HgcA protein sequences from the large curation efforts from McDaniel et al. 2020, Capo et al. 2022, and Gionfriddo et al. 2020 for example integrated into this uniprot release? It would seem easier in this case to pull directly from the Capo et al. database since those are curated sequences and metadata to link back to, unless I'm missing how Uniprot accessions work with incorporating data from MAGs Response: Thank you for pointing this out. We considered using the MATE-Hg database from Capo et al. 2022 for this study at first, but some reasons made us turn to the UniProt Reference Proteomes (RP) database eventually. First, this work considered the gene tree (HgcA tree) and the species tree (house-keeping genes tree) together to resolve the evolutionary history. Since the MATE-Hg database does not contain the house-keeping gene information, we decided to use the RP database. Second, to build the species tree, high-quality genomes are required to extract enough house-keeping marker genes. Some host genomes in MATE-Hg database are not in high quality; they might not contain enough marker genes or might be produced from mistaken/biased binning processes. Third, in order to confirm the true hgcB genes to elaborate their evolution history, we used more strict criteria than the MATE-Hg database. Our study determined hgcB genes not only according to the HMM profile of HgcB, but also required they are located close to hgcA genes. Finally, the RP set we used is sampled from all UniProt proteomes containing most genomes in the MATE-Hg database. Therefore, the final dataset we used is representative and should be ideal to study the evolution of Hg methylation. Text: A few putative HGT events could be inferred from the larger clade of the HgcA tree e.g., Marinimicrobia-HgcA clustered with Euryarchaeota-HgcA in the archaeal cluster, Comment: Was the inference made by position in the tree or analyzing the pairwise sequence identity similarity of the proteins from this Archaea/Marinimicrobia? I am curious because in McDaniel et al. 2020 mSystems we also found only a few potentially clear cases of HGT but did this through pairwise sequence analysis, for example for a case of Deltaproteobacteria/Acidobacteria/Verrucomicrobia/Actinobacteria in permafrost Response: This inference was made by position in the tree and also the sequence identity. Marinimicrobia is a bacterial phylum, but the hgcA genes they carry are clustered with other archaeal HgcA in the HgcA tree. Also, the closest sequence with Marinimicrobia-HgcA in the nr database is the HgcA sequence from Theionarchaea archaeon DG-70-1, which has 98% coverage, 56% identity, and 72% similarity by blastp. We have also discussed this in our previous paper Lin et al., 2021 ISMEJ. Text Nevertheless, several hgcA+ genomes did not carry neighbouring hgcB genes, including all Nitrospina and a few Deltaproteobactiera and Firmicutes, potentially because of gene loss during evolution or incomplete transfer events (i.e., only hgcA genes were acquired during the HGT events). Comment: I wanted to clarify something from the methods - were just the hgcAB proteins from uniprot pulled down or the entire genome sequences for these hgcAB+ representatives? If you did have the entire genome, did you check for the cases where hgcB was missing if hgcA fell close to the end of a contig or not? I think Peterson et al. 2020 ES&T had a couple cases that hgcA was at the end of a contig Response: We have the entire genome sequences. We have ruled out the situation where hgcB was missing because of incomplete assembly. We confirmed that hgcA was not at the end of a contig and genes other than hgcB were located downstream or upstream of the hgcA. Text: Figure 3. Comment : Are these trees rooted with either cdh outgroups or fused hgcAB? I see the symbol for fused hgcAB but in Gionfriddo et al. 2020 fused sequences are usually used to root the tree for accurate topology inference Response: The HgcA tree in Figure 2 was rooted according to the MAD- and outgroup-rooting analyses shown in Figure 1. In that analysis, the root of the gene family tree was placed between CdhD and CdhE, with the ""small clade"" emerging at the base of HgcA. Therefore, fused HgcA is not appropriate to be used as an outgroup alone. Text: Our study reveals an ancient origin for microbial mercury methylation, evolving from LUCA to radiate extensively throughout the tree of life both vertically, albeit with extensive loss, and to a lesser extent horizontally. Comment: I think to make a statement like this you would need more extensive analyses quantitatively calculating gene transfer rates and using tree dating methods such as in https://journals.asm.org/do... Response: The evidence from our analysis that HgcA was already present in LUCA is its sister relationship to the CdhE clade, a group of genes which both our tree and those of others (e.g., Adam et al., 2018) suggest was already present in LUCA. If this hypothesis is correct, then the gene must have been lost extensively during subsequent evolution because it is less widespread across Bacteria and Archaea than are the CdhE (and CdhD) families today. We agree it would be interesting to know precisely when these events occurred during evolution, but this is a difficult problem for single gene trees, especially ones containing ancient splits. Note that the study cited as an example dates a species tree (of Streptomyces), not a gene family tree (as we would need to do to date the events within the CdhD/E/HgcA family. Published dated species trees of Archaea and Bacteria suggest that LUCA might have lived close to the formation of the planet ~4.5Ga (e.g., Betts et al. 2018, Moody et al. 2022), suggesting the deepest divergences between CdhE, D and HgcA occurred prior to that date, although these ancient nodes are difficult to estimate. Timing the subsequent loss of lineages within the HgcA clade would be interesting, but is impeded because it is not straightforward to determine when, or how many, losses took place along the long stem branch. Text: We mapped the presence/absence of merB and hgc genes onto the Tree of Life Comment: If I interpreted the methods correctly, this tree only includes ribosomal proteins from genomes that either have hgcAB/merB or both of them. This isn't exactly overlaying hgcAB/merB presence/absence onto the ""tree of life"" because to accurately portray these relationships you would also want to include genomes that have neither or these operons. To do this accurately you would want to overlay the information you have here including genomes that are in Hug et al. 2016 for example Response: Thanks for pointing this out. Yes, we agree that this is not the ‘tree of life’. The tree only includes genomes that either have hgcAB or merB or both of them. So this is a species tree rather than a tree of life. We will modify the sentence in the next version to clarify. The modification will not affect the results that we deduced from the tree",2023-03-15T18:03:08,disqus_JxAdGPUNqR,John Moreau,10.1101/2022.11.21.517362,Ancient origin and evolution of microbial mercury methylation,"Heyu Lin, Edmund R.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.14.516467v2#comment-6138191641,biorxivstage,0,"Summary: Molecular dynamics simulations (MD) have emerged as an important tool in drug discovery. Their application to prospectively discover binding sites and to screen compounds interacting at those sites, remains a frontier application, even for compounds with high potency. Here, simulations are used to run a “virtual fragment screen”/”swimming experiment” for two compounds with very weak binding affinity that they identified as potential hits by SPR. In some sense, because of the weak affinity and limited interactions, these results are much more impressive and surprising than the landmark “How does a drug molecule find its target binding site” paper from the Shaw group a decade ago ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.... The poses are validated with crystal structures of these fragments bound to PTP1b. The major strength of this paper is showing that MD simulations can identify weakly bound fragments at allosteric sites (even those not previously highlighted extensively in fragment screens) with binding poses that closely resemble experimentally obtained structures. The major weakness of this paper is that the authors only performed “swimming” on two fragments, which does not allow us to generalize how well MD simulations both predict other allosteric sites and how well MD simulations predict fragment poses of larger chemical spaces of varying fragment sizes. Given the large number of negative controls available from the SPR screen and the relatively large number of positive (ish? - as affinities weren’t measured) controls from Keedy et al fragment screens, a larger study could be conducted - but for now, this work remains a tantalizing glimpse into the capabilities and potential of the swimming method for PTP1b. Major points: The authors initially performed SPR to identify two fragments for MD simulation and crystallization but this appears to be a very small number of fragments for MD. Could they discuss how feasible (or not) would it be to perform MD simulations of the whole library to identify potentially weaker fragments that may not have been detectable by SPR? Additionally, how might the “swimming” approach compare to a more conventional pipeline (e.g. identifying binding sites and fragment pose compare to mixed solvent MD with virtual docking)? The authors describe two binding sites for the fragments they identified through SPR, one that was previously identified (DES-4884) and a second site that they report as an allosteric site (DES-4779) but do not describe or provide structures of any broader structural changes to PTP1b that occur as a result of fragment binding at either site. The authors should show an alignment between apo and bound states of PTP1b to highlight allosterically induced structural changes. The authors highlight the DES-4884 fragment inducing two phenylalanine rearrangements (Phe196 and Phe280). While Phe196 conformational change has also been reported in fragment screens, they say that the Phe280 also swings out but don’t explain whether that could be of significance to future fragment screens (does Phe280 create new binding opportunities, increase/decrease fragment affinity, induce broader changes to the structure of PTP1B?) It would be helpful if the authors could contextualize the phenylalanine rearrangements with what is previously known about this allosteric site for future fragment screens. Minor points: We feel that the crystallography section of the methods and materials is incomplete. It would be helpful if the authors: 1)  explained what PTP1b construct they used, 2) the crystallization conditions, 3) the structure resolutions, 4) method of obtaining fragment bound structure (fragment soaking vs co-crystallization) and 5) how they identified the fragments in their crystal structures. Further information about how crystal diffraction data was collected and processed would be helpful. Figure 3e: The authors show the DES-6016 variant of DES-4884 makes hydrogen bonds with at least two water molecules. Do the authors propose that this allosteric site requires coordination with water molecules for fragment binding? How stable are the water molecules in the MD simulation to support this? The authors mention that for each fragment there were additional minor binding sites from the MD simulations. During the crystallization experiments, were fragments detected at these binding sites as well?

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.03.515069v1#comment-6133954829,biorxivstage,1,"Hello. Below is a review compiled by the MICR603 ""Journal club in immunology"" at the University of Tennessee Knoxville: UTK MICR603 “Journal club in immunology” review of the paper by Gomes et al. “Shigella induces epigenetic reprogramming of zebrafish neutrophils Summary. Innate immunity training is a growing field of immunological research. Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and β-glucan are the two most studied triggers in innate immunity, but research using other triggers such as metabolites and inflammatory cytokines is much more understudied and primarily focuses on macrophage training. The authors of this paper aim to fill in the gaps of neutrophil training in a host system using the human pathogen Shigella flexneri. Gomes et al. use a zebrafish model to study trained innate immunity, and they demonstrate that neutrophil priming with Shigella successfully generates a protective immune response against reinfection. They also dive deeper into the factors that could contribute to this immune response, such as host immune factors, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and Shigella effector proteins. The authors also show that this neutrophil priming induces an increase in the histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation epigenetic marker in neutrophils, and they show that primed neutrophils show greater antimicrobial capabilities via mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Positive feedback. This study broaches a much needed subject of research on the development of strengthening host immune responses to a human pathogen that is lacking any effective vaccines or preventative treatments. A positive for this paper is the reasoning behind using zebrafish as a model organism for this study. As the authors state, zebrafish lack a trained immunity until 4 weeks post-infection, causing them to rely solely on their innate immunity. Zebrafish are also effective models for studying human pathogens, as they share greater than 80% of disease associated genes with humans. The authors do a great job of showing that their method of neutrophil priming does indeed induce a trained immune response and that it is non-specific and long lasting. They use multiple infections with Shigella and other bacterial components throughout the paper to establish the validity of using their system with this bacterial pathogen. The use of different pathogenesis screens (cell bacterial cell counts and zebrafish survival) and different techniques (imaging, survival screens, FACS sorting, etc.) also enhances the strength of their methods. The authors also do well with showing that Shigella-induced trained immunity can be protective against other bacteria other than Shigella, specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Another positive component of this paper is the use of ample supplementary figures to support claims they are making in their main text. Major Concerns There is some conversation lacking on prior research on what is known about how S. flexneri interacts with the host immune system. Adding in some more information on the current knowledge, or lack thereof, of how this pathogen interacts with the immune system would strengthen the reasoning behind this study. The authors should use a methyltransferase inhibitor, such as PF-06726304 acetate to confirm that histone methylation leads to immune training by Shigella. The authors are looking at histone h3 lysine 4 Histone h3 lysine 4 trimethylation as an epigenetic marker in this system, however, the reasoning for using this epigenetic marker in favor of others is unclear. For example, lysine 27 acetylation is a major transcription activator for human cells, and it would be beneficial to discuss why something like this was not explored. This epigenetic pathway could be playing a role in infection as well. Detection of cross-protection of trained innate immunity to different bacteria is interesting. Does that immunity work against viruses or fungi? Can this be tested or perhaps discussed (if testing it is too expensive currently)? Most of the analyses are presented for mRNA (e.g., for gene expression). It would be good to provide evidence for proteins too when possible and relevant. There is a bit of misinterpretation of the impact of Shigella immunization on neutrophils. The way the text is phrased currently is that immunization changes neutrophils. That is incorrect as “current” neutrophils are terminally differentiated cells and should die soon (within days in mammals). So, training is probably happening in stem cells that result in production of new neutrophils. This nuance must be carefully stated. - Or are neutrophils in fish long-lived and can be “trained” after leaving the bone marrow? We know that neutrophils may have their impact on bacteria more than just phagocytosis. How do authors know that i) suppression of growth, ii) NETs generation are not important in control of Shigella? Minor concerns The lethal dose of S. flexneri should be introduced as soon as the non-lethal dose is discussed for ease of comparison. Figures 1C &D - How were these cells quantified? Stating the exact method in the figure legend would make it more clear. Figure 1H & I -Including 24 and 48 hour time points like the ones included in C and D to these graphs would help readers fully compare the first and second infections. Figure 2F - These two data sets do not look significantly different. The figure legend just states that the P value is <0.05, but what is it specifically? Stating the actual P value would give readers the ability to see how close to the cut off the value actually, and it will solidify the significance. Figure 5A- FACS sorting neutrophils can sometimes change the physiology of the cells, as they often spontaneously NETose during sorting. This physiological change could have an impact on the ChIP-seq results, and a disclaimer stating this fact would be beneficial. Gating strategies for flow cytometry analysis (such as in Figure S5A) should be shown. Stating the doubling time of Shigella in zebrafish would be useful for data interpretation. It would be beneficial to explore other experimental methods such as Hi-C and A/B compartment switching analysis to get a further understanding of the influence Shigella is having on host chromatin structure and epigenetic changes. A diagram in Figure 1 of zebrafish anatomy and the regions of inoculation would be beneficial for people that are not as familiar with this system to better understand where you are doing your infections. It is difficult to read panel A of each figure in the bioRxiv format, as the disclaimer at the top covers parts of the figures.",2023-03-10T04:42:43,,MICR603,10.1101/2022.11.03.515069,Shigella induces epigenetic reprogramming of zebrafish neutrophils,"Margarida C.

To address the issue of false positives in our procedure, we employed several strategies. First, we used three machine reading systems to extract computable knowledge from the literature corpus, which helped to minimize subjective biases that could introduce false positives. Second, we used logical closure operations to infer missing knowledge and ensure that our search results were logically consistent. Third, we mapped the output to target terminologies and combined it with ontology-grounded resources to increase the accuracy and specificity of our search. Fourth, we translated epidemiological definitions of confounder, collider, and mediator into queries for searching the knowledge graph, which helped to reduce the risk of identifying variables that were not relevant to our study. While we did not explicitly measure the false positive rate (FPR) in our study, we acknowledge that this is an important consideration in causal feature selection. We plan to explore methods for measuring FPR in future work, such as using simulation studies or external validation with gold standard datasets. Regarding your comment on the potential for our procedure to return every entity that is connected to one of the parent nodes of Depression and AD, we agree that this is a risk. However, we used a combination of manual curation and computational approaches to select relevant literature and extract computable knowledge, which helped to reduce this risk. Additionally, we limited our search to variables that were causally related to depression and AD, which helped to narrow the scope of our search and increase the relevance of our results. As for the reasoning for allowing chains to cross through nodes with low specificity, we chose to include these nodes to capture all potential variables related to depression and AD, even if they were not specific to these conditions. We believe that this approach helped to identify variables that may have indirect or unexpected effects on the causal relationship between depression and AD. However, we acknowledge that this approach could increase the risk of false positives, and we plan to explore methods for minimizing this risk in future work. This paper introduces the method as a pilot project. Much more work needs to be done! (As the first author, I struggled with these ideas myself. A possibility is to explore using different centrality metrics. We shall see!) Please check out the newest version of the paper.

The bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica causes respiratory infections, atrophic rhinitis, and kennel cough. B. bronchiseptica is widely transmitted via respiratory droplets between animals. This study investigates the dynamics of how B. bronchiseptica induces an immune response and, more specifically, on how eosinophils may provide long-term immunity against Bordetlla spp. after B. bronchiseptica infection. Using RNA sequencing data, animal disease models, microscopy, and cytokine analysis, the report confirms that eosinophils play a larger role than previously thought in generating a more robust adaptive immune response. Positive feedback. There are several good things about the paper. Eosinophils are an understudied and potentially misunderstood immune cell type, and the paper sheds light on their role in a bacterial infection (while it is typical to think of eosinophils to be important in worm infections). The use of mutated Bordetella btrs and RB50 strains was a significant strength of the paper. In comparison to the immune response in the murine models, they provided solid evidence collectively. In addition, the repetition of screening methods for the effects of the mutant on immune suppression provides stronger evidence of immunological variation. Using two strains of mice (Balb/c and B6 with two different mutants) is also a strength. Major Concerns The authors do not talk about the specificity of the GATA-1-deficient mice for depletion of eosinophils. It has previously shown that GATA-1 regulates basophil development and function of basophils ( https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.... Perhaps as a confirmatory experiment, the authors should perform eosinophil depletion with mAbs as was previously published ( https://www.jacionline.org/.... This will allow to confirm that eosinophils are directly involved in the process of bacterial control and better establish causality. When looking at lymphocytes in the lung, authors do not discriminate between cells in the lung vasculature vs. lung parenchyma. This may be important to determine which cell population is actually in the lung and involved in bacterial control. How intravascular staining could be used to detect cells in the blood vs. tissue is described here: https://www.nature.com/arti... The authors need to add figure/panels on the gating strategies for detecting T cells and B cells, along with histograms for major panels. When determining if eosinophils are required to promote a TH17 microenvironment, Figure 7D shows a possible false positive - i.e., detection of IL17 in naive lungs. These tissues should not have IL-17. Measurement of immune responses are not numerically consistent between different panels. For example, Fig 34D states 200 million T cells to be detected which is likely impossible. Please check ALL numbers and make them correct. In most cases it would be useful to measure Ag-specific immune response. Is IFNg+ T cells detected specific to the bacteria? Side note: B. bronchiseptica rarely infects humans. It is a clinical concern in animals such as canines, felines, livestock, and mice. iBALT formation may correlate to tissue damage within the lungs of humans. I understand that the infection with B. bronchiseptica may provide resistance to B. pertussis, but vaccinations are already in place to provide resistance. Do these vaccines stimulate a similar initial response as RB50 and RB50∆btrs? Minor concerns The paper did not give sufficient context for some of the employed models. Comparing BALB/c and C57BL/6 to the eosinophil-deficient EPX/MBP, for example, two mice models were used: BALB/c and eosinophil-deficient EPX/MBP. Prior to conducting study on eosinophils, I am unsure of the meanings of the acronyms, however I understand why they were used. Would experiments with infection and then antibiotic treatment be informative? Eosinophils have been shown to play a role in TB in mice, e.g., PMID: 34347010,  35905725. Perhaps this should be mentioned. The author should increase the resolution of the figures used in the paper, some axes labels are very tiny and impossible to read. The current state could lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the data provided. Throughout the paper, somewhat inappropriate language is employed. For instance, the term novel and the opening sentence of the abstract. Check if the author can also adjust the usage of these terms when describing findings. A less biased observation is the result. With a computer and printout, microscopy images proved tough to observe. For improved processing, the writers should raise the exposure of their photos. While discussing exposure, the writers should modify figures to make them more accessible to colorblind readers. The authors should quantify the relevance of the graphs' statistical significance. The values would aid the reader in comprehending which facts are significant. Some figures are difficult to comprehend because they contain too many or too few data points. Figure 5C is a case of insufficient specificity. The reader cannot grasp the data in the CD4+IL17+ graph. In many places conclusions are reached only by looking at mRNA levels. Can these be confirmed with ELISA? Statement that pathogens evolve to suppress immunity lacks evidence. Some pathogens may actually want inflammation for transmission, e.g., Mtb. Selection of differentially expressed genes should be corrected for false positive detection, e.g., using FDR (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wi... The author should add extra identifiers to Figure 6's figures. There are two D's on display. This makes it difficult to explain and read in the figure explanation. Figure 6's micrograph likewise lacks a visible or understandable scale bar. These photos may be difficult to decipher for the reader. For all the microscopy, the author should state that the images were taken with the same exposure. The authors should be more thorough in distinguishing that lungs are complex organs, with many results in different results where the organism tries to colonize.",2023-03-04T04:52:18,,UTK - Journal Club 603 ,10.1101/2022.09.27.509784,Bordetella spp. block eosinophil recruitment to suppress lung iBALT formation,"Nicholas J.

It is very interesting and plays an important role in collating this useful data! I have explored sexual dimorphism, including in body mass, in extinct organisms ( https://academic.oup.com/bi.... I am jealous of your extant research subjects! If you are looking for feedback on your preprint, then I am happy to give my thoughts (for whatever those are worth). I think your second figure is a more apt portrayal of the data than your first, because it presents the data with a mind towards effect size statistics (i.e., it reports the estimated magnitude of dimorphism and the uncertainty in that estimate without additional interpretation). Namely, I think that the secondary methodological step of designating each species into a categorization of dimorphic or monomorphic might obscure the excellent data you have amassed. I certainly understand and appreciate your use of objective criteria to assign a monomorphic label (i.e., when the 95% confidence interval straddles zero in estimated dimorphism magnitude). However, any finite population of males and females is not expected to have an effect size of precisely zero, even if just for stochastic reasons rather than reasons of sexual selection (or lack thereof!). So, what does the ""same size"" category actually include then? Those species that are labelled as ""same size"" between males and females could be those with relatively modest magnitudes of dimorphism (i.e., near, but not exactly, zero) and/or those with small sample sizes and therefore higher uncertainty (i.e., larger confidence intervals). For example, if you assume that these 39% of species that fall into the ""same size"" category are roughly equally likely to sit either just barely above or below zero effect size, then that would mean about 63.5% of species in orders with 10 or more taxa have an estimated effect size that places average male size greater than average female size -- albeit that many of those species have modest dimorphism and/or high uncertainty. That would seem (to me at least) to differ from the conclusion that males are not larger than females in most mammals, which I assume is derived from the ""larger males"" category being less than 50%, at 44%. I applaud your use of effect sizes and confidence intervals! However, I worry that by using these confidence intervals to then make a dichotomous (or trichotomous?) categorization, the method then becomes prone to the same shortcomings as does binary significance testing based on p-values (an approach that is becoming more and more criticized: https://www.nature.com/arti....

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.08.503174v1#comment-6122587412,biorxivstage,3,"I recently reviewed this manuscript for a journal. For the sake of transparency, I thought it was worth it to post my comments here on bioRxiv as well, as it brings the review effort within the public domain. Let me know if you have any feedback and congratulations on the work: it's a nice paper on a very important topic. Summary: The manuscript addresses the question of “shortcut citations” in methods description. Although this problem is frequently mentioned in debates about methodological reproducibility, it is understudied and it’s nice to see actual research about it. The results contain three main sections, which study (a) the prevalence of various types of citations in the methods sections of articles in highly cited journals, including shortcut ones, (b) examples of what happens when shortcut citations are followed and (c) a review of journal policies. This is followed by a reasonably extensive discussion focused on (d) guidelines on how to use shortcut citations. I generally agree that this is an interesting structure, as it (a) documents the phenomenon, (b) evaluates to what degree it represents a problem, (c) inquires what is being made to address it and (d) suggests additional measures. The weakest link in the chain, however, seems to be point (b) (i.e. measuring the impact of the problem), as I am not sure the case studies provided are enough to quantify this. I will try to make this clear in my main point below. Main point: - While the numbers of articles and citations in the first section of the study are probably sufficient to provide an overview of the use of citations, the 15 articles included as case studies in the second section are not. The authors seem to acknowledge this limitation, as they refrain from making a quantitative synthesis of these articles. That said, this leads this section of the manuscript to fall short in accurately presenting the importance of the problem. Although I found the visualization for each case study provided in Fig. S2 interesting, I would doubt that most readers will really make the effort to go through each one of them, much less be able to synthesize the data in their own heads to reach meaningful conclusions. Thus, I would strongly recommend that the authors provide some kind of quantitative synthesis of the problem in this section (i.e. What percentage of shortcut citations can ultimately be traced to the original reference? What’s the average number of steps? What percentage is behind a paywall? What percentage reaches a dead end or an insufficient description?). I note that 15 articles are probably too few for this purpose, and that the sample of articles in which citations are followed would have to be expanded. Thus, I would recommend that the authors perform a sample size calculation to reach the number of citations/articles that can provide reliable estimates within a given confidence interval. For this purpose, it’s worth noting that it would be desirable to perform synthesis both at the level of citations (i.e. what percentage of citations in the sample can be traced?) and at the level of articles (i.e. what percentage of articles in the sample have at least one untraceable citation?), as citations within a single article should not be considered as fully independent units when it comes to representing the whole population of citations. Thus, using articles as units for the purpose of sample size calculation might be the better option. Other general points: - The categorization of scientific fields is somewhat strange: most people would probably consider neuroscience is a subfield of biology, so presenting both as separate categories may puzzle some readers. I understand that this is a consequence of the JCR categories used, but making this clearer from the start (e.g. “examine the use of shortcut citations in neuroscience, biology and psychiatry journals in the abstract) and perhaps referring to the biology journals as “general biology” would help to avoid confusion. Still on this point, the selection of fields is narrow and ad hoc. I understand that this is a limitation posed by the authors’ own expertise, but it is nevertheless one of the main weaknesses of the manuscript. Thus, the narrow range of scientific fields examined should probably be mentioned in the limitations section. - Even within this relatively narrow sample of fields, the kinds of methods that deserve a protocol probably varies a lot: I’d guess that psychiatry journals include a lot of surveys and instruments, while biology and neuroscience might have predominantly wet lab protocols. It would be interesting if somewhere in the paper (possibly in the example cases provided) we could get a feeling of what kind of “protocols” we are talking about, even if only in a general sense. If quantifying/classifying them is not feasible, at least some illustrative examples could be provided. Are we talking about methods to quantify proteins? Scales to measure depression? Electrophysiology setups for rodents)? The citation culture probably depends a lot on the particular method, so the whole discussion sounds a bit disembodied without touching on this point somewhere. - Why are only minimum/maximum numbers of citations within shortcuts and the youngest/oldest citation coded? This looks like an approach to simplify data extraction, but it ends up providing very limited information (i.e. especially if there are many citations per paper, the oldest and youngest ones give very little information on the actual range). Moreover, this ends up making data visualization in Fig. 3 much less intuitive than it could be (i.e. it would clearer and more informative to provide the full range of citation ages). If the authors could provide the full ranges (although I’m not sure that this is feasible), this would likely strengthen the paper. If not, I’d reconsider whether Fig. 3 should be included in the main results, as I don’t think the results as displayed say much about the sample of citations as a whole. - Some points in the case series description and discussion mention that some references “provided a description that was no longer state-of-the-art” and that this may be a problem. I don’t really get the idea here: methods citation are supposed to provide an accurate description of what was done in a study, not of what’s the current state of the art of the method. In this sense, descriptions shouldn’t age badly or become “not-state-of-the art”. I understand the concern that a very old shortcut citation raises suspicions that it might not really describe what was done in the paper (as it may be likely that no one uses certain methods in exactly the same way after 50 years). But if this is what the authors meant, this should be stated more clearly, as it is not really the impression that comes out of reading these passages. In the same vein, mentioning in the discussion that “supplemental methods cannot be updated” is technically correct, but is not a limitation in terms of making methods sections reproducible (which seems to be the point of the paper). For the purpose of methods description, whatever was used in a paper should remain static, even though the method may evolve in subsequent study. - In terms of data sharing, one thing I could not find in the manuscript or in the OSF was the DOI and title of the articles used as case studies in Fig. S2. I may have missed it, but as there was no folder for the case series section I didn’t know where to look for it. As this seems important for reproducing the findings, this list should be provided somewhere (possibly as a document within the OSF) and cited within the text and legend to figure S2. Minor points: Introduction: - The correct name of the project mentioned in the first paragraph is Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology (not “for Cancer Biology”). - “This risk of bias for randomization sequence generation and allocation concealment was unclear…” – this sentence seems odd (in particular the “This” at the start), please revise the wording. Figure 1: - Isn’t the methods section a viable alternative for sharing details needed to reproduce experiments as well? While I agree that in many cases a separate protocol may be a better option, that depends on the length of detail that is needed, which will vary greatly depending on the method. Therefore, I would argue that the methods section should be included as an option in the figure – saying that the information “should” be shared in a separate document sounds overprescriptive. - The second “readers” can be omitted from the third sentence of the figure legend. Methods: - Instead of citing the full OSF page for “protocols, data and code for the prevalence study and journal policy studies” using a single link, wouldn’t it make sense to cite a specific DOI for each of these resources? The same thing hold for points in the text in which specific resources are cited (e.g. “The full search strategy is available on the OSF repository” could point to a direct link to the search strategy rather to the full OSF page). I think this is optional, as the Readme files in the OSF are clear. But providing specific links to each resource would be more consistent with the authors’ recommendation of providing pages for book citations, for example (in the sense of sparing the reader the trouble to search for a resource within a larger space). - What is meant by “top journals” exactly? Are those the ones with the highest impact factor in the JCR in their specific fields? Although this would be my guess, it is not clear from the description. - The data on whether papers were related to SARS-Cov2 sounded rather gratuitous, as Covid-19 was not mentioned anywhere in the introduction. If this data is to be kept in the paper (I personally don’t think it adds much), the rationale for extracting this should be mentioned somewhere. - Though this eventually became clear, I initially had a hard time to understand what was meant by “number of citations per shortcut”. This could be made clearer when this variable is first introduced. - The description of a probable shortcut states that “additional details are not provided in the following sentences or elsewhere in the methods sections”. But what happens if the method is fully explained outside of the methods section (i.e. in the supplementary material or in a repository)? I was unsure how these cases were classified, so it’s probably worth commenting explicitly on it. - Electronic searches were performed using the terms “[journal name]”, “journal citation reports ranking”, “author guidelines”, “journal policy”, and “impact factor”. I don’t quite get what this search means to achieve. Why would one need to search for “impact factor” to look for policies? Results: Figure 2: - The different areas have different mean numbers of methods citations per paper (being somewhat higher in Biology). Thus, showing the results for different categories in percentages as in Fig. 2A may cause misleading impressions – although there are still less “How” citations in Biology than in Neuroscience or Psychiatry when measuring absolute numbers, the actual difference is smaller (while that in “Who or what” citations is even larger). Having the bars represent absolute numbers (possibly still displaying the percentage within the bars) – with overall longer bars for Biology – would likely provide a more accurate impression of what’s going on. - It took me a while to understand the right panel in Fig. 2B. While the fact the two sides of the violin plots represent different data eventually becomes clear, wouldn’t it make it easier on the reader to break the information for probable and possible citation into separate plots (especially as the left panel uses symmetric violin plots)? Tables S5 and S6: - Can’t the information in these tables be included in the legend for Fig.2 and Fig.3 (as it is relatively short and essentially synthesizes the data in the figures)? This is optional, but would leave the information in one place instead of creating a lot of supplements. Figure 5: - Are the categories in Fig.5A and 5D mutually exclusive? It would seem to me that a journal could encouragd providing sufficient methodological details both in the author guidelines and as policy, and that they may encourage sharing methods in more than one place (i.e. repository or supplemental files). This is likely worth commenting on in the legend. Discussion: - I don’t think the Germany and California examples mentioned in Box 1 are needed: there are plenty of places of the world with much worse access, and these particular examples are not particularly representative of difficulties faced by the world at large. - While I agree with the recommendation to “make all methods publications open access”, I don’t think that there’s any particular reason why methods papers are different from the rest of science (in the sense that they should be open access), so I’m not sure the recommendation really belongs here. - The discussion about copyright issues described in the list of recommendations is long for an item in a list. Thus, it probably would fit better in the main text or in a box. Table S7: - I get the feeling that Table S7 would read better if lines and columns were reversed (i.e. methods as lines, features as columns), but it may be a matter of taste. - Why are supplemental files and protocol journals deemed static while shortcut citations are not? This does not make much sense to me. - I’d say supplemental files would generally be expected to have been peer reviewed. I agree that this is likely not always the case, but that probably depends more on the reviewer than on the journal (e.g. I don’t know of journals that explicitly exempts supplementary material from the peer review process), so I’d remove “depending on the journal”. - The comment “protocols remain available over time” made for repositories stands for all categories – it makes sense when comparing a protocol repository to a lab notebook, not to the other forms of describing protocols. Thus, I’d probably not include it as an advantage here. - I’d argue that both shortcut citations and supplemental files are “findable” for whoever’s reading the paper (which is likely what matters here), so I’d be inclined to remove this category. - Clinical journals are not the only one to publish protocols as articles (the systematic review community has a tradition of publishing protocols, for example). Figure 6: - In the last no/no option, describing the method in the main text (if it is simple enough to fit) should also be included as an alternative.",2023-02-23T20:27:02,olavoamaral,Olavo Amaral,10.1101/2022.08.08.503174,"Taking shortcuts: Great for travel, but not for reproducible methods sections","Kai Standvoss, Vartan Kazezian, Britta R.

However, as they directly observe, their bioinformatics analyzed sequencing data does not cover a 33 nt stretch between genomic nucleotides 23,908 and 23,940 of MERS HCoV-EMC/2012, which corresponds to amino acid residues 818EQLLREYGQFCS829 in MERS S. This missing sequence is at the N-terminus of the ""upstream helix"" (UH, MERS S residues 816-851) - a critical spike ectodomain scaffold structure that is extremely conserved among betacoronaviruses [1-4]. Without this local 818EQLLREYGQFCS829 sequence, the ectodomain would be structurally unstable and the resulting mutant MERS S glycoprotein most likely functionally inactive [3,4]. It is therefore incorrect to conclude that ""HKU4r-HZAU-2020+S(MERS)"" is a representative of ""enhanced potential pandemic pathogen (gain-of-function) research"", because the sequencing data presented by Jones et al probably does not constitute a functional MERS S glycoprotein. In the context of biosafety and biosecurity, extreme care must therefore be taken with specific statements about ""enhanced potential pandemic pathogen"" and ""gain-of-function research"". The authors and/or bioRxiv content editors should have moderated the above statements and conclusions before publication. Also, it is unclear if ""HKU4r-HZAU-2020"" itself (the proposed backbone) corresponds to an actual virus; and any experimental attempt to bioactively resurrect a putative viral bioinformatics sequence of unknown origin poses considerable biosafety and biosecurity risks.

Also the growth rates are normalized, so they are in 1/h so they should not be scaled as those are independent of the abundance (like all growth rates are).

It is a very important challenge, to develop cryo-FocusedIonBeam/ElectronTomography (cryo-FIB/ET) technology further to be able to investigate not only single cells but also patient derived tissues. The authors attempt in their manuscript to address mouse and human brain tissue by cryo-ElectronMicroscopy (cryo-EM) - tomography is aimed in the future. Several groups attempt to do cryo-FIB/ET on tissue with different technical and sample preparation techniques. In our recent review [Bäuerlein & Baumeister (2021) JMB https://doi.org/10.1016/j.j... ] we address the challenges that need to be taken. In this present manuscript the authors  successfully manage a lamella preparation in brain tissue with an approach developed in 2014. Despite a technical solid approach the sample choice, retrieval and preparation are key to the molecular interpretation of cryo-EM studies! Here I see serious major issues with the sample retrieval and preparation. Besides a technical good approach, the sample preparation is at least as important, to be able to draw high resolution conclusions from the imaging data. MAJOR ISSUE 1: In the presented manuscript here, the way of preparation of human brain (post-mortem, ischemic due to long lasting anoxia (8.3h!), chemical fixation) doesn’t allow conclusive interpretations at molecular resolution - particularly not investigating neurodegeneration, which the authors project to do! In our recent review [Bäuerlein & Fernandez-Busnadiego & Baumeister, (2020) TICB https://doi.org/10.1016/j.t... ] we argue why post-mortem, anoxic brain tissue should NOT be chosen for the interpretation at high-resolution for the investigation of neurodegenerative diseases: „However, postmortem tissue is not suitable for high-resolution studies, as brain tissue is extremely sensitive to anoxia and rapidly develops into brain death due to global ischemia in the dying patient. Irreversible cerebral damage develops rapidly, leading to a drastic decrease of survival in minutes if an individual is not resuscitated [92]. Furthermore, the chance of a favorable neurological outcome of a surviving patient after 30 min of resuscitation is vanishingly low [93], indicating major neuronal damage. Substantial structural alterations, affecting most organelles and cytosolic structures, have been observed in the first minutes to hours after global ischemia [94–97]. And importantly, cerebral ischemic injury and neurodegenerative disorders share many commonalities [94]. Thus, studies using high-resolution methods on postmortem tissue [98,99] image a cellular situation in which the neurodegenerative pathologies cannot be distinguished from postmortem artifacts and should thus be taken with caution.“ Brain tissue is the most sensitive tissue to anoxia in the human body - several minutes of hypoxia (stroke, heart arrest) cause first structural changes in minutes and typically causes irreversible ischemic damage to neurons. Thus the term „excellent tissue quality“ is more than questionable, many hours of anoxia like in this study (8.3h). Since cryo-EM offers molecular resolution the condition of the sample must be strictly close-to-physiological, which can reasonably not be expected many hours under anoxic conditions. The authors conclude however an „excellent tissue quality“ with stating a tissue pH of 6.3. I wonder what the term ‚quality‘ here refers to!? Under physiological conditions the intracellular pH is narrowly buffered to typically 7.2, the cells surrounding CSF (an ultra-filtrate of the blood) is typically around 7.35. An acidosis with values below a pH of 6.8 is incompatible with life - so how can a brain tissue pH of 6.3 be interpreted as “excellent tissue quality” in terms of physiological vitality, which is essential if high-resolution interpretations want to be made? In contrast to the authors interpretation I suspect this brain sample to be seriously ischemic, degraded, acidic and simply dead, which are normal processes post-morten and thus a more than suboptimal target for high resolution analyses! And importantly, cerebral ischemic injury and neurodegenerative disorders share many commonalities [Nikonenko (2009) Anat. Rec.]. MAJOR ISSUE 2: In it’s adequate use - by cryo-fixation - cryo-EM enables the investigation of the cellular context at molecular resolution in a close-to-native state. The authors chemically fix the human post-mortem brain, which causes structural alterations at the molecular level [Gilkey & Staehelin (1986) J. Electron Microsc. Tech] and thus dissipates any of the favorable advantages of cryo-EM. In Fig 5 all panels show ‚empty‘ white spaces in the micrographs indicating precipitatation of soluble proteins on membranes and the cytoskeleton. Fig. 5 actually has an appearance almost like a dehydrated, resin embedded sample and looks quite untypical for cryo-preserved tissue. Also the contrast of these micrographs appears quite untypical for cryo-EM micrographs. The comparison of chemically fixed brain in Fig 5 to the not fixed mouse brain sample in Fig 4 visualizes the strong alterations chemical fixation introduces on the molecular level. Thus taken together the title of this Fig 5 „Ultrastructural preservation“ is likely exaggerated! MAJOR ISSUE 3: The major prerequisite for the ultrastructural preservation of intact cells and tissues is the vitrification of the biological matter. This means the absence of water-ice crystallinity. Sadly the authors offer no proof of absence of hexagonal ice crystallinity in their manuscript - this definitely is a must. In Fig 4B there are indications of crystalline water ice: corresponding black and white diffraction patterns also called Bragg diffraction patterns seem to be present here. This indicates that larger parts of the mouse brain sample might not be vitrified. MAJOR ISSUE 4: The standard way to represent microscopic data in the cryo-ET field is at least a slice of a tomographic reconstruction to not be biased by superimposing structures in the three-dimensional lamella or membranes that are only visible when looking at an angle which is near parallel to the membrane sheets. Here I am very surprised to exclusively see 2D projection images - this is very untypical and doesn’t support the fact, that the whole aimed cryo-ET pipeline works. Why is there not a single tomogram shown? The figure caption in Fig 4 claims the left panel as tomographic slices however they very much appear as simple projection micrographs. I would definitely show at least slices from 3D reconstructions and not 2D projections - this is minimal standard in the cryo-ET community. For example, conclusions drawn like in Fig 5 C) are not substantiated: How can the authors be certain in the interpretation that this structure is a ribosome-associated VESICLE without any 3D information - this might just be an ER tube extending in the z-direction which was cut off to top and bottom by FIB-milling? Besides this I am stunned to read in the methods section that for a single projection, an excessive dose of 100 e/Å^2 was necessary - this is a dose typical for an entire Tilt-series acquisition with about 30-50 projections - is that maybe the reason why a tilt-series could not be recorded to reconstruct a tomogram? MINOR POINTS: Furthermore I would love to see some typical overviews of entire lamellae - this could give a nice impression of the cellular context and also show how well the H-bar cryo-FIB preparation works. It would also be helpful for the community, if the authors share their most representative data on EMDB (Electron Microscopy Data Bank) - this is common practice in the field. CONCLUSION: Thus, in conclusion the technical approach is interesting but as lined out there are several major issues - leading the use of ischemic, post-mortem, heavily anoxic brain tissue, and chemical fixation which each separately are incompatible sample preparations for high resolution imaging as intended with cryo-ET. We emphasized the importance of the sample quality in our review in Trends in Cell Biology. Major issue with the perspective of the authors future intentions: The authors plan to do sub-tomogram averaging of post-mortem patients brains with this work-flow - a very well-meant advise: this is not going to be successful! Chemical fixation denaturates proteins which alone will make sub-tomogram averaging rather meaningless. Furthermore, the biological/medical conclusions drawn from protein functional states, concentrations, distributions and so on, will be very questionable when imaged in the dying, heavily ischemic brain (after some hours, there will likely not be a single neuron alive). Necrosis, apoptosis, breakdown of all membrane potentials and gradients, depletion of ATP, protein degradation and many more processes will be governed by this - so how does one want to separate the effects of death from disease mechanisms during the lifetime of the patient? Thus this approach needs to be profoundly reevaluated, when questions about disease mechanisms of neurological and psychiatric conditions are the target!",2023-02-22T12:31:33,felixbauerlein,Felix Bäuerlein,10.1101/2023.02.11.528064,Cryo-FIB workflow for imaging brain tissue via in situ cryo-electron microscopy,"Jiying Ning, Jill R.

For figure 1B, it might be useful to include figure S1A instead of just showing figure 1B. Before looking at S1A it was very confusing to understand why the macrophage population was said to return to baseline while myofibroblast population remained constant when the graph seemed to show both leveling off at around 10%. Looking at figure S1A helped clear up that confusion so it might be helpful to just include that in1B instead. 2. For figures 1J-1M, the results and data are very exciting, however there seemed to be a sample size of just one per time point and therefore no standard deviations were provided. The data might be more convincing if there could be a larger sample size. 3. Lastly, the idea of using both mice and pigs as model organisms seems to be a good system. However, it is a little unclear why for animals the threshold for an ""adult"" was 3 months when pigs seem to take longer to mature compared to mice.",2023-02-21T20:06:19,disqus_rHSPpImoUb,Pauline Young,10.1101/2023.01.01.522422,Circuit to target approach defines an autocrine myofibroblast loop that drives cardiac fibrosis,"Shoval Miyara, Miri Adler, Elad Bassat, Yalin Divinsky, Kfir B.

Bayesian Reduction for Amplified Quantization in UMAP Embedding results in a more granular an accurate cell identification, pointing at data pre-processing as a crucial step for continuous type of data.

Stress is a very common public health problem, leading to numerous health concerns and reduced societal impact. For a while, it has been thought that the host immune system plays an important role in the development and progression of anxiety disorders, however, there are few studies which address this. In the same note, it is now being appreciated the link between gut and brain, through the gut-brain axis. Yet, there are limited studies which link physiological stress to gut permeability. This study aims to link the host immune system to anxious disorders, primarily looking at response to stress of mice. The authors utilized mice deficient in ɑβ T cells (TCRb-/-) and observed lowered anxiety behavior following exposure to stress. Additionally, the authors found that there is an inverse correlation between IL-22 and anxiety behavior. By injecting IL-22 into mice undergoing stress, the authors found that these IL22-injected mice exhibited lower neuronal activation in the septal area, that resulted in less stressed behavior.  As the gut is a major source of IL-22, they additionally demonstrate that stressed mice have increased gut permeability, resulting in TH17 differentiation through microbiota-stimulated IL-1β, and resultant IL-22 production.  As such, IL-22 is an attractive therapeutic target for addressing anxious disorders. Positive feedback. This study addresses a much needed topic of research, understanding how the host immune system modulates psychological anxious disorders. Through cutting edge immunostaining and sequencing techniques, the study identified specific immune molecules and how the host immune system regulates anxious behavior in specific areas of the brain. Furthermore, with the addition of experiments demonstrating the therapeutic capabilities of their findings were impressive and were much needed experiments to validate their findings. Another important element of the paper is the sheer amount of data that includes behavioral experiments, brain imaging, immunity-related parameters, and microbiome manipulations. Major Concerns It is not clear from the materials and methods whether measurements of mouse behavior have been randomized. Because handling the animals can introduce stress too, operators performing cage experiments must not know the mouse group. Additionally, more information should be provided on conditions under which behavioral tests have been performed - e.g., at night (typical time for activity of mice)? If not, perhaps experiments during night time must be repeated. There is a need to have other, more objective ways to measure stress level in animals including those treated with IL-22. For example, measuring levels of stress hormones could strengthen the argument. Some experiments need controls. For example, having some positive controls could be useful - these could include different doses of IL22 injected to see proportional changes in behavior, using known behavior-influencing (stress-reducing) drugs could help to better interpret the data. Also, the experiments with T cell transfer into T cell-deficient mice, having sham-operated animals (transfer PBS or B cells) could be a useful negative control. There does not seem to be much discussion about figure 1B. This is a major dataset, so the authors should spend more time going over what the figure is showing and how to interpret the dataset. Figure 2F -  the authors should split up the microscopy into individual channels and then do a merged image. It was difficult to view specifically where Fos was located. The authors should additionally show an unstressed mouse as a negative control to show the difference between staining. Figure 2H - Throughout the manuscript, the number of mice per treatment was 5, however, for this experiment, it was only done in duplicate. The authors do not mention this, so justification for this low of a number must be done. When the authors are talking about IL-22 suppressing neuron activation, they do not seem to mention microglia activation in the brain. León-Rodríguez et al., Nature Communications, 2022 look at microglia activation in anxiety-like behavior, so the authors should consider experiments investigating microglia activation or discuss these findings. Figure 4A - When mentioning the TLR4 reporter, in the results, it is mentioned as “microbial exposure in mice treated with our repeated mild stress paradigm”. This is not inherently true. It is simply how many TLR4 ligands (lipopolysaccharides), which have not entered circulation due to a leaky gut. The wording for this needs to be changed. The authors mention IL-1β playing a key role in this model system, however, they do not mention inflammasome activation for how IL-1β is produced. Which cell types in the gut are hypothesized to be the source of IL-1β? Could these experiments be repeated in inflammasome deficient mice (NAIP, NLRC4, or NLRP3 perhaps)? Figure 5H - The hypothesized model for the system is much appreciated, as there are many players at play. However, with the current state of the model, it is overtly simple. If the authors could have this more broad model, but have separate panels for what they believe to be occurring within the gut and brain, respectively, it would be more clear to the reader. Minor concerns Continuous line numbers would assist with the review process. It appears the line numbers start over each new page, so having the line numbers continuous could assist speed up the review process. If the authors could talk about why they chose to perform single-nuclei RNA-sequencing over bulk single-cell RNA sequencing, that would make the data/story more clear. Figure 3A - The microscopy cannot be seen on printed paper. If the authors increase the exposure, it would help with the resolution of the microscopy. Figure 4A - The TLR4 reporter needs to be discussed further. The authors do not discuss it enough for a non-expert to understand the meaning of these findings. Figure 5A - The microscopy cannot be seen on printed paper. If the authors increase the exposure, it would help with the resolution of the microscopy.",2023-02-18T16:18:05,,Guest,10.1101/2022.09.16.508224,Microbiota-stimulated Interleukin-22 regulates brain neurons and protects against stress-induced anxiety,"Anoj Ilanges, Mengyu Xia, Junmei Lu, Lei Chen, Rani Shiao, Changchun Wang, Zheyu Jin, Ru Feng, Qingqing Qi, Han Yi, Jixi Li, Marc Schneeberger, Boxun Lu, Jeffrey M.

This would be a very useful and fast method, if it could generalize to more complex designs - and if it is calibrated in terms of type-1 errors. Disclaimer: I want to highlight a conflict of interest: We are developing a julia package MixedModelsPermutations.jl - to allow permutation tests for crossed random effects. The package is already publicly available, but the accompanying paper was delayed due to parental leave. Further, the authors of the papers can’t possibly know, but, ClusterPermutationTests for MixedModels are already inofficially supported in Unfold.jl - We have presented it at VSS2021, but the approach is currently not properly tested or documented. I understand that my following comments raise questions to the core contribution of the paper. I tried to write this comment in a constructive and clear way, and I sincerely hope we can have a constructive conversation. I am happy to clarify my concerns where necessary, or even provide some simulations if something remains unclear. I think this approach has several important limitations: 1. The paper claims that “our method can be easily applied to a wide variety of experimental studies with more complex fixed structures.”.Following from this, the paper reads to me, as if this method would generalize to any crossed random effects dataset, whereas, if I understand it correctly, it is likely that it is only applicable to intercept-only crossed random effects 1 + cond + (1|subject) + (1|item). This is the only model that the author simulated and tested the data from. But EEG is commonly used with repeated-measures within subject conditions (measuring the same condition within subjects - in linguistics also within-item effects are common, e.g. using the same word in two different context / conditions). Indeed, in their applied example, the author analyse a within-subjects design, with a non-within subjects statistical model. This has very stark consequences on their type-1 errors, which will be greatly inflated (e.g. the classical paper is Barr 2013 - I recently published a blog post + interactive tool on this as well https://benediktehinger.de/...). Now one could argue, that because we are using cluster-permutation tests, we would expect this inflated type-1 error in the H0-permutations as well. But this is, as far as my intuition goes, not ensured in the PermCond permutation, and even in the PermFull, trials are permuted only within-subject, not within-items (both at the same time is difficult/impossible to do). Again inflating the type-1 error and breaking the structure mappings to random slopes/efffects. The authors argue otherwise: “Here, we limit to suggest to be parsimonious for two main reasons” - referring to the “parsimonious LMM study” by Matuscheck 2017. But importantly, Matuscheck (as I understand it) do not propose to simply go with the most simplified model. They rather argue, that simplifying a model, once it does not converge / does not have enough data support, helps more than it hurts. 2. The authors compare PermFull with PermCond. But the PermFull method is already a new method (as far as I know). For neither methods (analytical or numerical) tests of type-1 error-rates and type-2 error-rates / power (compared to gold standards) are provided, on the Single MixedModel case. If the argument is, that these permutation schemes work only by combining it with cluster-tests, then I’d similarly would like to see the numbers and comparisons. 3. The authors further make the strong claim, that permuting LMMs for cluster permutation would result in “unfeasible computational costs”. To counter this point, I reimplemented a similar permutation approach using UnfoldSim.jl, by simulating data for LMMs with their 19 channels and 50 timepoints (without the complexities of headmodel and cluster permutation test). Our LMM analysis takes ~2ms per LMM compared to their ~230ms reported in Matlab for an equivalent test. We used the Julia toolboxes Unfold.jl for EEG analysis and MixedModels.jl as the backend.

In their task, participants have to adjust their force to minimize the impact of a ball on hand motion. To look at the effect of extra-retinal signal, they added a condition where the gaze was constrained. Strong point: The results of the study are not consistent with the hypothesized model and forced the authors to revise their model. I applaud the authors for publishing this null result. Figures are good and provide information about individual datapoints. The statistical analyses are convincing. Weak points: The model is very lightly described, and it is difficult to understand how correlation across different variables could be explained by such model. Even the sign of the correlations is difficult to predict based on the description of the model. Reduction of smooth pursuit signal is done by imposing gaze fixation on a target and by adding an occluder that hides the target from view. By doing so, the authors reduced the amount of information that is available  to judge the speed/momentum of the target. Yet, this time is critical to build an estimate of target motion. For instance, acceleration signals can be estimated within 500ms but not 200ms (Bennett et al. 2007). It is unclear how long the target was visible in the freevieweing and constrained conditions. It is often unclear what are the extra-retinal signals that the authors refer to. Is it an efference copy of eye movements, is it an internal representation of target motion? Is it something else? Eye fixation allows the authors to get rid of efference copy but does not prevent the participants from building an internal representation of target motion. Many non-significant p-values are interpreted as absence of effects (even when p=0.07). Yet, this is not the case. The authors have a very limited sample size and it is difficult to draw any conclusion from the absence of an effect in such case. The wording should be revised accordingly. Looking at Fig. 2C, it seems that the gaze speed is still contaminated by many saccades as smooth eye velocity cannot reach values as high as 200 deg/s. This might have to do with the fact that the authors first low-pass filtered their data at 15Hz and then detected the saccades. Desaccaded eye velocity trace can best be obtained by using an acceleration threshold on an unfiltered signal (de Brouwer and Lefevre, 2000 and 2001) Minor comments Fig. 3: it is unclear why the authors do not report the evolution of other variables such as APF or RDF over the course of learning. Is the decrease in variability due to lower force rate and less signal dependent noise? Fig.5A: TOFO is defined as distance of the target when anticipatory force starts to increase divided by target speed. Given this definition, it seems very logical that TOFO would be influenced by target speed. Experiment 2: How similar remain the correlations reported in Fig.4 in experiment 2 when the gaze is constrained? Possible improvements: p.21 “Thus, the hand force during contact may be largely determined by feedforward control and intrinsic viscoelastic properties of muscles” is important but not highlighted enough.

Yong Cao and I had several rounds of discussion on the issues you raised. Your suggestions and comments are italicized. We will follow up as more results come out. We discussed your manuscript in our lab and enjoyed its balanced tone and inquisition of an important aspect of the search. Thank you for sharing your search parameters for xiSEARCH and as a developer of that tool I second your choice of parameters completely. However, to answer the question “STY or not STY?” your current search experiment seems insufficient to us for reasons detailed below, and we would like to suggest a number of controls and changes. When allowing either KSTY or KGVL you disregard an important element of link assignment based on the often-incomplete MS data. Indeed, the MS2 data often do not unambiguously assign the linked residue by neighbouring backbone fragments and the likely link site is chosen based on the predefined chemistry of the linker. Fig 2G is a nice example of this. Depending on what you define as chemical preference of the crosslinker, you either report S or G. In all those cases, any residue is equally likely based on the MS data and your linker definition determines the reported site. If STY are disregarded and the abundant GVL are pre-defined, obviously, they will be reported. To put this to an extreme, why do you not disregard K as a link possibility and only allow GVL? We would like to suggest a couple of changes to your experiment: (1) To determine if STY are targets of NHS crosslinkers, only evaluate sites that were reported unambiguously based on MS data, i.e, with neighbouring fragments. Maybe run a completely indiscriminate crosslinker and look for enriched amino acids. Open modification search analyses linear peptides which differ from crosslinked peptides in not having a second reaction step in a spatially confined setting. The first reaction of a crosslinker brings it into the protein, the second reaction takes place with a spatially proximal residue of appropriate chemistry. The second step can only be assessed by looking into crosslinked peptides. Reply #1: These are good points.  Evaluating only the sites that are reported unambiguously based on MS data is an excellent idea, but doing it requires a software tool to filter out such CSMs. Unfortunately, we do not have such a tool. Do you know if anyone has such a tool? About running a completely indiscriminate crosslinker, we are wondering what will go into this. Do you suggest that we search, for example, a DSS dataset as if DSS could react with any amino acid and see what happens? Or, to do a new wet-lab experiment with a completely indiscriminate cross-linker? What cross-linker would it be? Not sure if photoactivated cross-linkers are truly completely indiscriminate. It’s unclear to us what question this experiment aims to address. (2) To determine if the data support STY as well or as poorly as the chemically meaningless GVL, define a linker KSTYGVL to let STY and GVL compete. Note that xiSEARCH currently will take the more C-terminal residue in any ambiguity window and thus have some random component in link site assignment. If an ambiguity window contains a K near STY, xiSEARCH has a preference setting for K, though. Consequently, if a STY is reported in favour of a nearby K, there must be supporting MS2 evidence in the spectrum for this report. Reply #2: Thanks for this suggestion. We conducted the KSTYGVL experiment on Ribo-DSSO dataset. As shown below ( Fig. Reply #2), the pLink search result and the xiSearch search result are very similar to each other. Once again, the identified GVL-cross-links outnumbered those of STY-cross-links, agreeing with the results obtained from separate KSTY and KGVL searches. (3) Do the GVL linker experiment (no KSTY). I would expect you to find many crosslinked peptides, nearly all the same peptide pairs as with K or KSTY. Reply #3: We conducted the GVL-only search and the STY-only search and compared the identification results with K-only (K and protein N-term) search at the sequence pair level. Namely, if two pairs of cross-linked peptides—one from the GVL- or STY-only search and the other from the K-only search—involve the same pair of peptides irrespective of the link sites, they are regarded as a match (peptide sequence IDs are consistent). This analysis showed that 56-60% of the GVL- or STY-only search results overlapped with the K-only search (see Vienn diagrams below, Fig. Reply #3). However, 39.5% of cross-links IDed from the GVL-only search are unique, suggesting that they contain false peptide sequence IDs. Similarly, 44.1% of cross-links IDed from the STY-only search are unique. As the two percentages—39.5% and 44.1%—are close, we conclude that if some of the STY cross-links are correct, they should be few. This agrees with the results of all the other analyses conducted in this study. (4) Do KYST versus KGVL and match the YST with the GVL peptides where the are the identical peptide matches and compare the score. Plot a 2D scatter plot with score(YST) versus score(GVL). My expectation is that you will have many equal scoring peptides (ambiguity window based on insufficient MS2 data) and many cases where the score(YST) will be larger. Reply #4: Good advice—thank you! We made two scatter plots, one for the pLink search result and one for xiSearch (shown below, Fig. Reply #4). For most pairs, we see nearly identical scores. Occasionally, a STY-cross-link may score better or worse than its cognate GVL-cross-link. In Supplementary Figure 4C, we present a well-matched spectrum for a K-V cross-link. In this spectrum, one can find evidence from fragment ions for α16(V) being the link site instead of the adjacent α15(K). To us, this example shows that accidental match does happen, for GVL-cross-links as well as for STY-cross-links. As a final note, link site assignment is currently an open issue of crosslinking, and you are right to point this out. Curiously, speaking to Jan Kosinski as a modeller, he did not care about link sites at all. Our own work on using photo-crosslinking (where link site assignment is even more problematic because of the wider reactivity) did not show difference in protein structure model quality using link sites with a +/- 5 residue scatter (PMID: 26385339). So far, it seems to be unclear if link site precision offers any structural value. I hope it does… albeit it might not, considering the length of NHS crosslinkers and the flexibility of proteins. From a mass spectrometry side I would, nonetheless, prefer to see link sites reported with a measure of precision. Reply #5: We agree with you on this for the most part. The third paragraph of the discussion section of our manuscript conveys a message that echoes much of what you have said above. Namely, Category I and Category II STY-cross-links, which are actually K-K cross-links and K-mono-links that are misidentified as K-STY cross-links or in rare cases as STY-STY cross-links, are of little harm. However, some Category III STY-cross-links could be misleading in serious ways, because they involve falsely identified peptides. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us, and for inviting us to think more. We have enjoyed this discussion and we look forward to exchanging more ideas with you.

I learned a lot from it, and really enjoyed your research. Overall, I thought your focus was fascinating and your flow of ideas from one question the next was clear and significant. Here are a few more specific constructive comments I had (and comments from my classmates), and I'll try not to repeat my classmate! These comments are only to help, so I hope they do; sorry if my comments are just due to myself misunderstanding the data, but hopefully they can call for clarity. 1) For the flow cytometry data in Fig 1A, we discussed possibly having a positive control to give us a visual of how your results show the resulted significance. How about a foxp3-coded bead for the positive control? 2) For Fig 1, like my classmate said, the experimental methods were unclear why you chose the male sex for the mice, especially when you used female mice to donate WT Tregs later in Fig 3 to both sexes? Explaining your reasoning for these choices, and controlling for sex could be more clear. 3) For Fig 1B and 1D, it might be helpful to include transformed data as well as the untransformed data to see the statistically transformed significance. 4) For immunofluorescence imaging in Fig. 2, 4, and 5 like mentioned the stain colors (dark blue and light blue together) is confusing, and the grey stain is basically impossible to see. 5) Furthermore, though you specified sample size, it is unclear if they are samples from the same mice or different mice... if it was the former, then it would actually  be n=1. Just being specific about this would clear up this uncertainty. 6) For figure 3, you put adoptively transferred Tregs into both male and female mice which gives an extra category of sex to your data, along with the category of aged v. young Tregs. You need to account for this category in your data to ensure reliability in your resulting significance. A 2-way ANOVA might be more appropriate over a 1-way ANOVA. 7) Showing significance bars/stars on Fig 3D and 3H would be consistent and helpful. 8) Would be helpful to include the FDR in subfig 4 9). The volcano plot in 4B is extremely pixilated and the reader cannot zoom in to a clear figure to analyze. 10) The sample sizes are variable, and for some of the small sample sizes, it is unclear if there is a large enough effect size for these to be meaningful. Maybe running a power analysis could clarify this. Thank you for reading, and hopefully these comments can help.

Tissue-resident macrophage are cells playing an important role in homeostasis of tissues by removing dying cells as well as responding to local exposures to microbes. The origin of tissue-resident macrophages has been under intense investigation; studies primarily done in laboratory mice suggest that some macrophages (e.g., microglia) are derived from yolk sac during embryonic development while other macrophages (e.g., in the gut) are primarily derived from circulating in the blood monocytes. Laboratory mice are typically kept in clean conditions with little to no exposure to many pathogens, and whether the conclusions found studies with mice extend to other animals including humans remains unclear. This study takes an advantage of using GFP-expressing hematopoietic stem cell (HPSC) transplantation of monkeys with barcoded stem cells to track the dynamics of barcoded, bone marrow-derived cells in the tissues. Interestingly, the authors found that macrophages in liver, spleen/LN, and GI tract have high frequency of the GFP expressing cells and suggesting high turnover of these tissue-resident macrophages from bone marrow-derived precursors. Authors performed several additional analyses to ensure robustness of their findings including imaging of GFP-expressing macrophages, analysis of barcode sequences between different bone marrow-derived T cells, and using classical pulse-chase experiments to detect division of macrophages in the tissues. Positive feedback. The study is a timely addition to the debate on the origins of tissue-resident macrophages in animals that live in environments with larger exposure to environmental antigens. The use of barcoded bone marrow-derived cells to track origin of cells in the peripheral tissues is innovative and interesting. The analysis of imaging data to ensure that GFP-expressing macrophages are not phagocytosing other cells is important, and PCA analysis of the barcodes is important to establish relatedness between different cell types. Labeling with BrdU is also a useful way to look at cell turnover that had been forgotten and may be revived by this study. Yet, because of some missing controls and not fully rigorous analysis of the data the conclusion that tissue-resident macrophages in monkeys undergo relatively rapid replacement from bone marrow-derived cells remains to be determined. Major Concerns It seems that several controls are missing in the paper. In particular, having the data in which samples are done very early after HPSC transplantation would be very important - it is expected that no GFP+ cells would be then found in tissues - so, presenting data for GFP+ cells (e.g., for key populations) as these change over time would be most useful for interpretation (some of that is present with barcodes but comes too late in the paper). This is a major limitation of the study that does not allow to fully interpret the data. Most tissues are filled with blood. How do you know that you did not sample cells in the blood that have features of macrophages (e.g., MHCII+)? Work with serial intravascular staining by Mario Roederer’s group clearly showed contamination of tissue samples (e.g., LNs) by blood-derived cells (PMID: 33441422). Some type of control is needed (e.g., intravascular staining). Are these “myeloid cells” macrophages? Can the authors show some other types of data, e.g., imaging that clearly identifies those isolated cells as macrophages? Gut-resident macrophages are known to be primarily monocyte-derived, so for these cells, finding high frequency of GFP+ cells is not surprising. What about brain-associated macrophages in monkeys? Are these HPSC-derived? (In mice, they seem to be yolk sac-derived). Another site to look at may be skin and other skin cells (e.g., Langerhans cells?) It is hard to interpret what the data on percent of GFP+ cells mean. For example, if one finds 20% of cells with irradiation of monkeys in 2-3 months after transplantation, what does this suggest in terms of kinetics of macrophage turnover? It seems that the authors would benefit from some type of mathematical modeling-based analysis to generate a baseline prediction on expectations. PCA analysis lacks rigor. Finding that some points are “clustered” and some are not must be done with some statistical tests. For example, resampling the data and reclustering may provide some evidence of robustness of clusters. Interpretation of BrdU data can be made better.  There have been a wealth of mathematical models aim at inferring cell division and death rates from pulse chase experiments (e.g., 9469816, 10799860, 12737664, 23034350), perhaps authors could use those methods to provide some boundaries of the macrophage division rate and/or differentiation-from-monocyte rates. Also, including some data - if available - on labeling during pulse dynamics - could be very informative. A comparison to some other cells that we know do not have long residency time in tissues may be useful - e.g., neutrophils. THese are thought to be relatively short-lived cells in the blood (but this is again debated) and in the tissues. What is the GFP/barcode kinetics in neutrophils? Minor concerns Authors should better describe experimental design and specifically sampling details. For example, Fig 1A does not fully explain when the animals were sampled. Is 46m is the time of 1st sample for JM82? Is 49m when the animal was sacrificed? Only looking at Fig 3 it is possible to see sampling times but this is too late in the paper. Captions must be improved to explain that all and be more detailed. There are sometimes too generic statements that may not be fully supported by the presented data, e.g., turnover of ALL macrophages being rapid (e.g., last paragraph in Discussion). Yet, authors only sampled some tissues. Paper organization could be improved. For example, it is easier to review the paper when figures and figure captions are located on the same page. Numbering the lines in the paper can help to provide comments to specific parts of the paper. Better formatting of the references would be helpful - .e.g, more space between individual entries or numbering the entries. Figure 2D could include control with macrophages that may carry high levels of of TCRg, e.g., from the thymus. Figure 2 figure legend could be more descriptive about which panels are representative of which sample Figure 2 could have info on the tissues where samples were coming from (e.g., Macrophage/liver), etc. GFP staining in these images is hard to interpret - perhaps adding a membrane stain and DAPI (nuclear stain) could help to tell that GFP is in the cytoplasm. Table 1 could also include symbols/shapes used in graphs to identify animals. Would be very interesting to see spleen confocal to compare macrophages and their GFP staining - will them have the scattered signal due to taking up dying cells? Adding shapes used in Figure 1A &D to differentiate each group to Table 1 would be helpful It may be useful to discuss potential reasons for macrophage dynamics differences between mice and monkeys - is that because species are different or because they live in different environments. Would experiments in dirty mice be useful to tell if the environment is what is the main driver of (perhaps) different macrophage dynamics in some tissues? For necropsied animals, is it possible to show data for macrophages in tissues that show little evidence of link to hematopoietic system (e.g., microglia)? It may be useful to more thoroughly discuss the efficiency of lentivirus infection. Does this efficiency impact interpretation of GFP/barcode dynamics, e.g., does one need to normalize the data in some way? The number of samples per time point (e.g., Fig 5) is varied per animal and tissue. Perhaps some justification of this could be useful. In Figure 3, would it be possible to better describe how to interpret the PCA plots? Also, it would be good to use other colors besides green and red as green-red color blindness is the most common form.",2023-02-11T22:49:23,vitalyvganusov,Vitaly V.

It is particularly interesting to see a low-risk experimental framework to quickly evaluate some of the risks posed by possible future recombination when diverse variants are co-circulating. I am curious about the rationale to define ""Delta"" as 90% GISAID consensus for B.1.617.2 and define ""Omicron"" as 90% consensus for BA.1. Omicron by this definition is a genome that has been observed, but it is unclear that Delta as defined in Fig 3A has been observed, with a previous report defining 5 Delta clades [1] that each include multiple non-synonymous ORF1a mutations. Are we sure that Delta as defined here was ""naturally occuring"" and that, if it was, how relevant is this genome to those previously compared to Omicron? Specifically with respect to nsp6, Delta sequences include one of H11Q, T77A,  or V149A (the latter with or without T181I). Notably, nsp6 T77A is defining for B.1.617.1. Searching COV-SPECTRUM for March-May 2021, 39,726 sequences include Delta consensus mutations in Fig 3a. There are 21 sequences within that set with nsp6 lacking any of these mutations and brief examination of placements on the UShER tree indicate imperfect sequences (reversions, etc). Additionally, Omicron BA.2/3/4/5 have nsp6 differing from that in BA.1, but the same as that observed in previous variants (e.g. alpha, beta, and gamma). It would be very interesting to see apples-to-apples comparisons of these nsp6 and hopefully this methodology can help unravel the significance of recurrent nsp6 deletions and subsequent nsp6 adaptation in future work. While Delta lineages were eventually dominated by those containing nsp6 T77A (~97% by the end of 2021), a Delta lineage with nsp6 V149A/T181I contributed its nsp6 to the XBC lineage, with derivative lineages adding nsp6 I50T. This is one of the few ""Deltacron"" lineages with a Delta nsp6 and may be of special interest. Lastly, Fig 3A does not include S:G142D in its definition of Delta; absence in over 10% of sequences is a dropout artifact [2]. [1] Stern et al. medRxiv 2021. https://www.medrxiv.org/con...

However, we did have some concerns. Some of which have already been mentioned by my peers. I was particularly concerned by Fig 5. My concerns were that I did not understand why down-regulation in aged Treg results in causation for myelination regeneration. For, correlation does not mean causation.",2023-02-11T02:32:37,akshayajayakarunakaran,Akshaya Jayakarunakaran,10.1101/2023.01.25.525562,Ageing impairs the regenerative capacity of regulatory T cells in central nervous system remyelination,"Alerie Guzman de la Fuente, Marie Dittmer, Elise Heesbeen, Nira de la Vega Gallardo, Jessica White, Andrew Young, Katie Mayne, John Falconer, Christopher E.

If the goal is to adjust EE for the confounding effect of differing body mass, this method is inappropriate; it essentially mathematically forces lighter animals to have higher 'adjusted' EE and vice versa. There are many many papers on this, dating back to 1949 and more recently emphazed in the NIH-supported biomedical realm; see, e.g., Kaiyala and Schwartz's Toward a More Complete (and Less Controversial) Understanding of Energy Expenditure and Its Role in Obesity Pathogenesis published in Diabetes or papers by John Speakman, Mattias Tshop, or a host of others.",2023-02-10T18:05:05,karlkaiyala,Karl Kaiyala,10.1101/2023.01.30.526183,Hypermetabolism in mice carrying a near complete human chromosome 21,"Dylan C.
