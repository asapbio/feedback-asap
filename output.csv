This described H.J. Muller’s attempt to explain why ( not how) X chromosome dosage compensation had evolved, in spite of there being only ""exceedingly minute differences"" between compensated and uncompensated phenotypes (2). It was shown that the paradox could be resolved by considering, not the specific functions of individual proteins, but the collective functions of proteins per se. One such function would be the collective pressure exerted by proteins in the crowded cytosol to drive individual protein species from simple solution (aggregation) when their concentrations exceed specific thresholds. It was proposed that over evolutionary time, individual genes, both on X-chromosomes and autosomes, would have fine-tuned factors such as transcription rates and protein stabilities to this collective pressure. However, without X-chromosome dosage compensation the total concentration of cytosolic proteins, and hence the collective pressure, would have fluctuated between male and female generations. Fine-tuning, a process of vital importance for intracellular self/not-self discrimination, would have been severely compromised. By that time (1994), with no clear justification, the assumption had grown that the degeneration of the Y-chromosome was alone sufficient to drive the evolution of dosage compensation. Thus in 1933 Haldane wrote (3): ""The tendency to balance may be regarded as a secondary effect of the accumulation of recessive lethals on the Y-chromosome. Indeed, this accumulation can only proceed as the X develops internal balance."" This coupling of Y degeneration and dosage compensation was implied by others. Charlesworth (1978) wrote (4) that the gradual degeneration of the Drosophila Y-chromosome itself: ""Creates a selection pressure for differentially increasing the activity of the X-chromosome in heterogametic individuals."" Of the mammalian type of dosage compensation, in 1991 Charlesworth wrote (5) that this: ""Creates a selective advantage to reducing X activity in the homogametic sex"" and added that degeneration of the Y-chromosome and dosage compensation are ""processes which must almost inevitably occur."" Much of the subsequent literature addressed the fascinating question of how dosage compensation could have evolved mechanistically in different species. Despite its promise in settling fundamental problems in immunology, the why problem received little attention.

Mukherjee et al. presented a similar therapeutic strategy but with an explanation for the therapeutic effect different from that of the author’s ( https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-019-0455-x).  It is important for the authors to address the different explanations for the similar findings in their discussion. Besides an anapleurotic explanation for the role of glutamine in driving tumor growth, the authors should also address a role for mitochondrial substrate level phosphorylation in the glutaminolysis pathway as an additional explanation for the effect ( https://doi.org/10.1080/17590914.2024.2422268). The authors assume that ketone bodies and fatty acids are critical fuel sources for pancreatic tumor cells based on their finding of labeled TCA metabolites derived from beta-hydroxybutyrate and caprylic acid. No evidence is presented showing that the pancreatic tumor cells can survive on these fuels in the absence of glucose and glutamine.  Caution is needed in considering labeled TCA metabolites as evidence for fuel utilization in the absence of viability studies. Abnormalities in mitochondria structure and function are found in pancreatic cancer (https://doi. org/ 10. 3109/ 01913 123. 2013. 788306; https:// www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ pubmed/ 6185201; https:// www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ pubmed/ 968802). Such abnormalities would obstruct efficient utilization of fatty acids and ketone bodies for ATP synthesis.  The authors must address the question of how ketone bodies and fatty acids can be critical fuel sources in pancreatic cancer showing abnormalities in mitochondria structure and function. Support for the author’s assumption would come from bioenergetic evidence showing that the MIA-PaCa2 cells die in hypoxia and cyanide, which would be expected for cells dependent on fatty acids & ketone bodies for fuel. No credible evidence is presented showing that the MIA-PaCa2 have normal mitochondrial function. The authors mention (reference 22) as an example of a ""push-pulse"" strategy, where a ketogenic diet nudges a system towards greater dependency on a specific metabolic program, which in turn exposes new dependencies. This paper is incorrectly cited as there is no mention of a ""push-pulse"" strategy in the paper. The correct terminology is “Press-Pulse and was first presented in the following paper, which is the correct citation (DOI 10.1186/s12986-017-0178-2).",2025-08-19T19:07:24,disqus_Pwi06huCe1,Eric Miller,,,,

A few suggestions for improvements to the optical explanations: - You suggest that the improvement in imaging depth achieved in THG in your experiments is mainly related to the wavelength used. But 1320 nm probably does not make a significant difference compared to 1150 nm. In fact, your gain compared to the other work you cite is mainly due to the use of 1 MHz OPA excitation. - You write “In previous work, we showed that the intensity of the THG signal from a slab of lipid surrounded by water increases exponentially with slab thickness” -> it is actually quadratically",2025-08-19T12:25:54,emmanuel_beaurepaire,Emmanuel Beaurepaire,,,,

I'm a happy user of Casanovo v5. I'd invite the authors to consider analyzing calibration accuracy (Figure 1a) as a function of peptide length.   Consider a 5-mer and a 10-mer peptide, each which has identical residue-level scores of 0.9 at every position.  Earlier versions computed overall scores from the arithmetic mean, and this calculation is length-independent, so the version-4-score of both the 5-mer and the 10-mer will be 0.9.  But v5, the product of the residue-level scores is used, and this is not length independent.  The v5 score will be 0.59 for the 5-mer and 0.35 for the 10-mer. The behavior of v5 might well be preferred, for many reasons!  And if a calibration curve like that in Figure 1a, but only considering short peptides, looks similar to a curve that only considers long peptides -- i.e. both short and long peptides are equally well calibrated, then the authors will have demonstrated one such reason.  Alternately, if calibration accuracy is different for short and long peptides, this would be valuable for users to know.",2025-08-15T21:11:01,tentrillion,Curt F.,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.07.663460v2#comment-6752240102,biorxivstage,0,"Congratulations on the work! This is an impressive achievement, and it's refreshing to see a particular research community conducting a large-scale metaresearch endeavour to reflect upon itself. That said, based on these results, I’m not sure I’d jump to the conclusion that Drosophila immunity has a replication rate that is higher than in other areas. Some of the studies cited as reproducibility estimates in other fields (Amaral et al. 2025, Errington et al. 2021), as well as large-scale efforts in psychology (e.g. Open Science Collaboration, 2015) and economics (Camerer et al., 2016) that helped spur the “replication crisis” narrative, have relied on performing independent replications of a particular sample of publish findings. This is quite different from reviewing the literature to look for conceptual replications, as the authors do to arrive at the conclusion that most of the findings in the field are verified (i.e. around 84% of those for which a published verification attempt was found). Interestingly, for the findings which the authors do replicate independently, replicability is much lower (only 16%). Although this large discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the authors focused on unchallenged and suspicious claims (which seems to be their preferred explanation), an alternative hypothesis is that there is a huge amount of confirmation bias in the Drosophila immunity literature, either because attempts to replicate previous findings tend to reach similar results due to researcher bias, or because results that validate previous findings are more likely to be published. As I think both explanations are plausible (and, not being an expert in the field, I’d have a hard time estimating their relative probability), I think the work would be greatly strengthened if the authors tried to replicate a sample of those findings that were validated in the literature. If they arrive at a similarly high replication rate, this would strongly support the authors’ interpretation of a high replicability of findings in the Drosophila immunity literature. If replicability is much lower in the authors’ independent replications than in the published ones, on the other hand, this would suggest that the high replicability estimate obtained from the literature should be taken with a grain of salt, and could be due to a large confirmation bias problem. I obviously understand that this would be a lot of work, but I do think it would matter a lot in terms of making skeptics (including myself) agree with the claim on high replicability.",2025-08-14T14:56:42,olavoamaral,Olavo Amaral,,,,

There is indeed a reasonable amount of heterogeneity between individual replications for many of our experiments (although it is smaller than the heterogeneity between replications and original results, as shown in Table 3). That said, I can only vouch for point (a) above: labs were theoretically under no pressure to achieve a particular result. They were also blinded to the original result and, unless they had a strong intuition about it or made an effort to look it up (which we consider unlikely), should not be influenced by it. Concerning point (b), we did not fully standardize protocols across labs: when methodological details were not provided in the original experiment, we asked for each lab to fill gaps independently so as not to overstandardize to a particular choice that might not correspond to what was done originally. Labs were also free to suggest adaptations to the protocol when they thought these were required – and in some cases they made quite different choices about how to deal with ambiguities or inconsistencies in the original article. Thus, part of the heterogeneity might be attributed to protocol underspecification in the original study. As the coordinator of the Initiative, I also cannot personally vouch for point (c). Although we tried to include measures to control bias in all protocols, and stimulated labs to include additional controls and checks when deemed adequate, each replication was ultimately performed in a particular lab by a different team, in the best conditions available at that facility, with no direct external supervision. Thus, I would not call those “very controlled conditions” – they are probably more accurately described as the “standard conditions in a Brazilian academic lab”. Protocol breaks were frequent (as shown in Fig. 5), and errors or inconsistencies in results were ocasionally detected and corrected, but there is obviously room for undetected errors or undercontrolled technical variability to affect results. Thus, I would not go so far as stating that there are intrinsic limitations to replicability in biomedical science: my conclusions would be more in the direction that “there are limits to replicability in Brazilian academic biomedical labs”. Some of these limits could be intrinsic, but many of them likely relate to infrastructure, researcher expertise, lab organization and other issues. And while my guess that most of these issues probably hold in other countries as well, this cannot be directly extrapolated from our data.",2025-08-14T14:24:00,olavoamaral,Olavo Amaral,,,,

Congratulations on a detailed study of this endemic species. I agree with you that a detailed Red List assessment is necessary and this data will certainly help. In this regards, I have a few suggestions for the paper. 1. Please do not criticize earlier assessment as based on literature survey and lacking field data. Many assessments start like this, as there is often data gap due to lack of local/regional research. It is perfectly valid to conduct an assessment with available data, as the purpose of assessment is to draw attention of conservation world, not to produce a paper. There is always possibility of re-assessment, in fact there are clear rules on how to go for it in Red List system. You can notice that the assessment clearly states ""needs updating"" on the Red List site. 2. If you want to conduct this assessment, its best to first take the assessor's training course https://www.conservationtraining.org/course/ which is necessary, if not mandatory. It can clarify many key terms. 3. If you have used modelling for the assessment work, it is necessary to get it validated as per Red List norms. The guidelines are openly available. 4. Coming to the assessment, an occurrence point map is needed and you can use GeoCAT app to calculate EOO and AOO. 5. If the EOO and AOO, are fitting within EN, you need to put a proper argument for (a) or (b)(i,ii,iii,iv,v) . Do you have data to say a. Species is severely fragmented? (even if you have not collected it, it is possible and accepted to make an informed guess based on species behaviour and biology) b. If not, then it hinges on the number of locations. Please do not equate this with occurrence points or localities. There is a specific definition of ""location"" which requires proper understanding of threats. c. continuous decline in habitat quality/extent etc can be definitely argued (known the habitat well), but that argument has to be detailed and based on hard evidence. There very specific evidence based reasons as to why EOO, AOO are mapped, calculated in a specific way. So although you may have different or more detailed data or view of it, unless you are able to put it in technical manner accepted by Red List, it would not be accepted. My suggestion is complete the training course, and then start a proper assessment. I will be happy to help you with the basics, but for actually updating the assessment in the online portal, you will have to contact and work with the relevant species specialist group.",2025-08-10T14:35:13,aparnawatve,Aparna Watve,,,,

However, in the original assay the learning is carried out on adult worms with F1 embryos (and germ cells) in utero which are exposed along with the parent (P0) to the pathogen. For maternal inheritance, effects at F2 are generally still considered intergenerational (ie maternal) effects - not ""transgenerational"" epigenetic inheritance. The effect would have to be shown at F3 (and also F4 as the original Murphy study showed) for them to really claim validation of the study. I refer the authors to the following review (PMID: 24679529), cited >2000 times, on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance which clarifies this point: ""In the case of an exposed female... the fetus can be affected in utero (F1), as can the germ line of the fetus (the future F2). These are considered to be parental effects, leading to intergenerational epigenetic inheritance. Only F3 individuals can be considered as true **trans-generational ** inheritance (see Box 1), in the absence of exposure."" Given the F2 effect in this eLife study is already quite small, its imperative that the authors show F3 and F4 data to actually test the original Murphy claim. Moreover, in some of the Murphy experiments, effects at F3 and F4 are even stronger than they are at F1. So, this should not be a problem if the authors have actually replicated the Murphy results.",2025-08-08T17:10:33,reviewer6,Reviewer 6,,,,
