Lacking data on Fatty acids analysis of some representative wild capelin testis, semen or centrifuged spermatozoa: The regeneration of sperm and endurance of males largely relate to absence/ presence of enough ""raw materials"" (i.e., high quality lipids, phospholipids and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids to be precise). The original hypothesis tested would be dubious, irrespective of any male sub-cohorts or phenotypes, if the above basic requirement is missing. 2. Lacking data on a gastrosomatic index (gut/ visceral weight divided by body weight and expressed in %) or gut content analysis: if some capelins are not feeding in between their spawning, it is highly unlikely they would replenish depleted energy reserves, and bioenergetically channel 50% of such intake energy in food to invest in gamete/ milt production. As such the original experimental design does not take into account a careful bioenergetics point of view either. Some whole-body carcass analysis of some representative capelin would have been beneficial as an alternative. I urge the authors to consider these in future work and good luck with the revisions.",2024-06-11T13:08:39,wonderfulponderfulponds,wonderfulponderfulponds,10.1101/2024.06.06.597742,Endurance rivalry in capelin: insights from semen quality and regeneration,"Ranjan Wagle, Connor P.

Looks like two of these papers came out just before we submitted the pre-print for approval (congrats to y’all on those papers!). We’ll take a look in the offing. For the abexinostat targets, I believe that came from Buggy et al. 2006 (which does need a citation as you say, sorry to those authors!), but we can also look through your 2022 NCB paper that you mention to make sure we cover our bases as well. It would also be interesting to see what MBLAC2 expression looks like in these cell lines (I don’t think there’s overlap for the lines tested with your 2022 paper?).",2024-06-11T07:23:45,,Devin Schweppe,10.1101/2024.05.23.592075,Lineage-specific proteome remodeling of diverse lung cancer cells by targeted epigenetic inhibitors,"Chuwei Lin, Catherine Sniezek, Ross M Giglio, Rashmi Karki, Christopher McGann, Benjamin A.

The fact that they have brought this up more than once suggests that they are not using standard accepted practices to maintain transgenic lines. [All presented experiments were performed after we became aware of the tendency of the roller and gfp phenotypes to fail in FK181. See our response to comment 3 on Figure 2 regarding maintenance methods.] 2. Dennis Kim’s work on phenazine-induced avoidance has been oddly neglected in this work7. Kim’s group found that phenazine-1-carboxamide induces Pdaf-7::gfp expression in the ASJ neuron, which we see quite reliably in our assays as well. No Pdaf-7::gfp imaging of the ASJ neuron is presented in this work, suggesting that either the PA14 they grew also did not make phenazines, or their image analysis is unreliable. [see above note on ASJ expression] 3. They made a lot of changes to our protocol (temperatures, light/dark, etc). We cannot find in this paper a single example of an experiment that followed our protocol entirely. [Choice assay (Table S2): Exp 1.1 and 1.2 follow the Murphy lab protocol throughout, except whether the choice assay plates were incubated on the bench top (1.1 light) or in the drawer under the bench (1.2 dark) for 60 minutes. Exp 2 and 3 (light) and Exp 4 (dark) follow the Murphy lab protocol Exp 4.1 and 4.2 follow the Murphy lab protocol throughout, but for the comparison of gravity settled (4.1) vs centrifugation (4.2) for worms prior to bleach treatment (at each generation). ASI daf-7p::gfp experiments (Table S1) (last four experiments) FK181_20_B-3, FK181_20_M-1, FK181_20_M-2, FK181_20_M-3] 4. The authors make a point of calling OP50 a pathogen, which is odd; C. elegans grown on OP50 typically live for 2-3 weeks. They cite Garigan et al. 20028, which showed that when worms get old (past 15 days) eventually the pharynx stops grinding up bacteria and the gut will start to fill up with OP50, and killing bacteria does slightly extend lifespan - but this is not an effect observed in young (Day 1) animals on the short timescales used in the experiments here. In any case, since both control and trained animals are grown on HG plates with OP50, it cannot explain the behavior of the control animals. [We also cited other sources for this statement and show that more nutrient rich OP50 growth conditions frequently increase OP50 aversion, sometimes dramatically (Figure 4). ] 5. The authors also never replicate the “bias towards Pseudomonas in choice assays ((Ha et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2017; Moore et al., 2019)” – Those papers also used OP50 vs PA14 to demonstrate this bias towards Pseudomonas, so it is unclear how the author think that their failure to replicate this basic finding is somehow supportive of any of their arguments. It is more likely that there is something fundamentally wrong in their initial conditions that have prevented the replication of all other groups’ findings, not just ours. Moreover, in our experiments, other than the 24 hrs of training on PA14 vs OP50, our control and trained animals are always on the same plates. This argument makes no sense, unless the authors have introduced an additional variable of plating control worms on one kind of plate/bacteria and their trained animals on a different plate/bacteria (which we do not do). [We address this (page 7): “Indeed, in our experiments (Figure 3), the control worms frequently showed a choice index score higher and more variable than that reported by Moore et al. (2019) and Kaletsky et al. (2020).” We explored many changes in growth conditions using only naïve animals and made no discernable progress in understanding why our naïve N2 worms find OP50 slightly more tolerable than PA14 than do naïve N2 worms in the Murphy lab. We conclude that section with “…supporting the conjecture that non-obvious growth condition differences, beyond what we have explicitly tested, may contribute to the discrepancy between our results and the previously published results.” We also note that the training and assay conditions described in Lee et al., (2017) differ more substantially from those reported in Moore et al., (2019) than any of the modifications we tried in order to observe a heritable response. Training plates were incubated 24 hours at 37°C or 8-16 hrs at 25°C as opposed to the Murphy lab conditions of 48 hours at 25°C. Furthermore, training was for 4 hours rather than 24 hours. The primary assay described in Ha et al., (2010) is a single-worm olfaction-based assay. In the experiment shown in Figure 4C, which compares this olfaction assay to the two-choice assay, the naïve worms show PA14 aversion, just as we usually observe. ] 6. It is unclear why the authors grew worms at different temperatures. 20°C is the standard temperature for worm growth and assays. [As explained in the manuscript, we hypothesized that 25°C worm growth temperature, which increases PA14 pathogenicity and was used in the original paper identifying the daf-7p::gfp response to PA14 (Meisel et al., 2014), could increase the degree to which the animals respond to PA14 in our assays. The 15°C pretreatment (i.e. maintenance of animal populations at 15°C for multiple generations prior to the start of the assay) was performed because the “C. elegans and bacterial strains and cultivation” segment of the Methods section of Moore, et al. (2019) states that “Worm strains were maintained at 15°C on High Growth Media (HG) plates.” This same phrase is used in the “General worm maintenance” section of Kaletsky et al. As our goal was to replicate the published responses, we felt it important to investigate all potentially meaningful variations to the protocol used in published work.] 7. In our hands, naïve OP50-PA14 choice index is not significantly different between P0 (when NGM plates are used) and the subsequent generations (when HG plates are used). The survival assay correlates well with the idea that their worms are very sick, much sicker than we see in our assays, although the sparse intervals in both assays make it difficult to draw any conclusions – not possible to draw the conclusion that the bacteria are “more lethal” since they are trying to compare two lifespans from different labs etc. - but if they are, it might be due to their PA14 cultivation conditions or the health of their worms. But the fact that they see massive leaving and desiccation of worms, they might indeed be growing PA14 under much more pathogenic conditions. [We would argue that the lethality of the PA14 observed in both labs is more similar than different. As we state in the manuscript: “If these potential environmental differences are sufficient to obscure the detection of the transgenerational effect, then the robustness and ecological significance of the transgenerational effect in a natural setting must be minor.”] 8. The authors state: “Near the conclusion of these experiments, we received an updated protocol that included several clarifying edits and additional deviations from the published protocols (C. Murphy, Personal communication).” We clarified our protocols, we didn’t “deviate” from them. This is a concerning way to present our email communications in which we tried to correct errors in their protocol and offer constructive advice; we even extended an invitation to Hunter to visit our lab to learn the assay. We are happy to provide these emails if necessary. [We apologize for the unfortunate word choice. It was not our intention to paint the refinements to the published protocol in a negative light.  We will change the wording in the revised draft to “updates”. We greatly appreciate the publication of detailed protocols and Professor Murphy’s multiple attempts to clarify our understanding of the protocol.] In order to help others, we continuously update our lab’s protocols to make clarifications that will help future users. Any note from the Murphy lab is an example of this type of updating. For example, later we made a new bacterial construct that used a Kan marker and constitutive promoter instead of an Ara inducible promoter and Carb marker to streamline experiments. This is not a deviation, it is a natural progression of the research in our lab and our practice of continuously improving our assays and updating protocols. It is disingenuous for the authors to present our updates to our protocols as if we have “deviated” from them – in every instance, we gave the authors all of the information that we had available to us at the time. Our suggestions were made genuinely and in good faith, with the assumption that the authors wanted to get the assay working rather than using it to point out changes in our protocol. [I remain deeply uncomfortable presenting the comparison between the published and communicated updates. We argued in multiple email exchanges with the editor at the journal where Moore et al was published (whom ultimately choose not to review this manuscript) that it was inappropriate to post your unpublished protocol in supplementary material and reluctantly settled on this compromise, in part because it was my understanding that he had conferred with you about this. As you intimate, this does not encourage  communication of evolving best practices.] Moreover, this statement corroborates our assertion that all or most of the data in this paper seem to have been generated using a protocol that differs significantly from our lab’s, as the bulk of their experiments appear to have been done before contacting us: “Incorporating these changes into our procedures did not reliably alter our results.” (no data shown) [To clarify, all the published experiments were performed after contacting Professor Murphy for reagents and clarification in 2021. Some of the experiments were performed after Sept 2023, when we received the requested reagents and final clarifications on the protocol. ] 9. “[T]his example of TEI is insufficiently robust for experimental investigation of the mechanisms of multigenerational inheritance” – The authors failed to test the fundamental requirement for transgenerational inheritance, that is, the expression of P11 sRNA by PA14, which only happens on plates at 25°C. Since they cite our subsequent papers where we first identified P11 sRNA as the key to TEI9, then our finding that the Cer1 retrotransposon is also required for P11-mediated TEI10 and then our finding that other Pseudomonas species use a similar small RNA to induce TEI11, they are definitely aware of this fact. Thus, it is not clear to us why they have not attempted to test P11 sRNA levels while searching for conditions that would replicate our findings. As a result, we can never know whether P11 sRNA was produced in any of the conditions that the authors tested in the experiments shown. [We make no claims about P11. It is a specious argument that to address the reproducibility of the methods and results in Moore et al., (2019) requires the reproduction of subsequent findings.] Together, Hunter and colleagues’ failure to replicate the basic naïve attraction to PA14 over OP50 demonstrated by other labs, their failure to replicate the P0 daf-7 expression published by other labs, and their failure to reliably replicate the P0 and F1 behaviors shown by other labs suggests to us that there are more basic concerns about their bacterial and C. elegans growth conditions, assay conditions, and assay techniques independent of any of the attempts to replicate the findings from our work. [These unsubstantiated assertions were addressed above. There is no consensus on naïve choice, no consensus on P0 daf-7 expression, and no consensus on P0 and F1 behaviors using the choice assay.  In contrast, we show data that OP50 growth conditions do affect choice.  We show and/or discuss data that directly challenges methodological assertions.]",2024-06-10T20:15:37,disqus_EPCF1dI6WB,Craig Hunter,10.1101/2024.06.01.596941,Irreproducibility of transgenerational learned pathogen-aversion response in C. elegans,"D.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.01.596941v2#comment-6477509328,biorxivstage,2,"Professor Murphy has misread our intentions.  Our goal was not to prove Moore et al., (2019) wrong, but to adjust the protocol to produce F2 learned aversion so that we could investigate how RNAi, including aspects of systemic and feeding RNAi contribute to heritable learned avoidance. If our goal was to challenge the result, we would not have spent nearly three years adjusting the protocol to achieve heritable learned avoidance. We presented all the results (and raw data) in the spirit of transparency, not to obfuscate.  Contrary to Professor Murphy’s assertions, among the experiments are some that closely approximate the parameters spelled out in their protocol.  We expect that, if the paradigm is sufficiently robust, then even moderate departures from the protocol would in aggregate show a tendency towards an F2 heritable result.  No individual set of conditions produced a reliable F2 result.  No aggregation of data across variable experiments showed a tendency towards F2 inheritance. Independent replication is the heart of scientific progress.  We published our results to encourage others to investigate and resolve this.  Unfortunately, the tone and content of the posted comments would dissuade most reasonable scientists from entering the fray.  Indeed, this apparently justified concern has already dissuaded other scientists with independent failure-to-replicate results from joining in the publication of these findings. I call here for many groups to attempt independent replication. I can provide an easy to follow protocol that in our view closely hews to the original. I encourage you to compare it to the published versions to verify its accuracy and/or to identify our mistakes. Although we do not doubt the published results, we no longer believe they support a paradigm for heritable memory.  We anticipate that future experiments will provide a simple explanation for our differing results. We encourage independent groups to prove us wrong.",2024-06-10T01:12:59,disqus_EPCF1dI6WB,Craig Hunter,10.1101/2024.06.01.596941,Irreproducibility of transgenerational learned pathogen-aversion response in C. elegans,"D.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.01.596941v2#comment-6477508113,biorxivstage,4,"We thank Professor Murphy for her considered response to our recently posted manuscript and data. To clarify for the readers, most of her comments and concerns are directly addressed in the manuscript. Note that this will be an eLife reviewed preprint and thus all reviews and our responses will be publicly available. We had hoped to avoid a public back and forth to avoid prejudicing the review of the manuscript (hopefully Professor Murphy was invited to referee the manuscript), but her public comments are sufficiently concerning that we offer a few brief responses. In this response, Professor Murphy’s comments are in italics and [Craig Hunter’s response is within square brackets.] Figure 1: 1. (A-C) It has been reported by many groups that PA14 is mildly attractive to C. elegans, that is, given a choice between PA14 and OP50, worms choose PA141,2. However, in almost every assay shown in this paper, the worms prefer OP50 over PA14 – that is, they are already avoiding PA14 - prior to training (naïve preference), which is odd. This suggests that the authors are not using conditions that are standard, either in PA14 or OP50 growth or in choice assays (see note about choice assay performance). This is a serious cause for concern that is independent of any training conditions. In fact, as far as we can see, in only one case (Fig. 1C, F1) did their experiments replicate the naïve choice results observed by other groups. [We raised this point directly (page 7-8). We then performed an experiment (Figure 4 with 8 replicates) to test the idea that OP50 growth conditions could have a moderate effect of animal choice. We also note in S2_annotations_and_comments_Moore_2021_Star_Protocols.pdf that the phrase “per standard worm maintenance protocols” is used to described how OP50 is prepared (and referred to as a “healthy stock of liquid OP50”) for some but not all steps in the protocol. In my lab, our maintenance OP50 starts with a glycerol stock. Some of us streak for a single colony (LB plate) which is used to inoculate 400 mL of LB media in a 500 mL bottle that is then “incubated” on the bench top for 2 days, or overnight at 37°C. Sometimes we re-streak this colony several times (depending on the frequency of OP50 preparation). Others inoculate the LB directly from the glycerol stock (skipping the streak for a single colony). OP50 may also be grown at 37°C with aeration, particularly when thicker lawns are desired to forestall starvation or to grow more worms. Other groups routinely use HG plates to grow thicker lawns to grow more worms or maintain stocks with less chance of starvation. In most cases the OP50 stock is stored at 4°C for a period of time. It is not clear from this generic statement, “per standard worm maintenance protocols”, how the Murphy lab prepares a “healthy stock of liquid OP50”. It is clearly stated in the published Star protocol (in notes before step 1) that aerated 37° OP50 is used for training plates and choice assay plates. Except at step 5d (prepare training plates) it is stated to use the OP50 culture conditions described from the “before you begin” section), which is the non-described “per standard worm maintenance protocol”. And in step 6b (To prepare bacteria for choice assay plates) it is stated “Maintain stock of OP50 as needed.” In response, we tried every reasonable combination of OP50 growth conditions for maintenance, training, and choice assay plates. They all perform similarly in P0 and F1 generations, and unfortunately, none of them enabled us to observe an effect in the F2 generation. ] 2. Choice assays: their “choice assays” involve putting 3-4x the recommended number of worms on a plate (up to 770 on a spot!), letting them roam for variable amounts of time (“30-60 minutes”) without trapping them (no azide or other paralytic used), and then putting them in a 4°C incubator (which does not immediately halt worm movement), then counting them. None of this follows our published choice assay protocols, or the standard chemotaxis assay protocol3–6. Putting more than 200 worms on a single plate can lead to altered choice because of crowding. In the absence of a paralytic, worms change their preference due to various factors, including adaptation; therefore, in this case, the worms’ first choice (which is what we measure in all our assays) is not being measured. They also count the worms by “aspirating” the worms off of the plate, which is not standard in any behavioral assays, as far as we know. [Yes, we experimented with variable numbers of worms in choice assay plates. The cited example is from a P0 plate where we confirmed successful training of N2 worms to avoid PA14. We also discussed this in detail (page 16, first full paragraph), where we also noted the lack of published data that underlies all the figures presented in Moore et al., 2019 and Kaletsky et al., 2020, and where statements in method sections indicate that choice plates with as few as 10-20 worms are included in the analysis and an uncited statement cautioning that crowding may influence choice assay results. Concerned, we tested this hypothesis (page 16): “we calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) for the number of worms per assay plate against choice index and then plotted r against the average number of worms per plate for each experiment (Figure S7).” We found no correlation in our data. We are interested in running the data from Moore et al., (2019) through this script as well. We addressed the use of azide, describing our logic, in the manuscript. Concerned that azide might be a confounding factor, we tested whether it could be interfering with choice in our hands. The choice assay is based on the design of chemotaxis arena assays, where worms ephemerally visit an area of a plate associated with an odor or chemical. In these assays it is important to preserve the animals choice with azide, which anchors them to their visit to the origin of the attractant. In the choice assay there is a food supply to potentially anchor the worm to their choice. As detailed in the Star Protocol (Moore et al., 2021) trouble-shooting suggestions, the diffusion of azide may variably alter the ability of worms to make an informed choice; for example if a worm is paralyzed while considering, but before choosing PA14 then the azide would interfere with worm choice. Thus, the use of azide may not be just superfluous, but problematic. We used the time-lapse record function on an iphone to record worms during select choice assays without azide. Nearly all worms made a first and final decision within 15 minutes (none were observed to leave their first-choice food within 60 minutes). To preserve the first decision, once all worms on a plate had made a choice, that plate was placed at 4°C (lids up, thus agar side in contact with heat absorbing surface to preserve choice). No difference was observed between azide and non-azide plates when tested within a single experiment. Thus, potential azide effects did not explain our inability to detect heritable learned avoidance. Azide was used for the data presented in Figure 1. Aspirating counted worms is a valid approach to avoid counting worms twice. In no way does this possibly superior method invalidate the results.] 3. Table 2 and Figure 1: There are almost no true replicates, as in each experiment, at least one or more condition is changed. (For example, the authors only tested the PA14 we sent them in one replicate - Exp 3). [Yes, we tested a variety of parameters that were either not specified precisely, were unsupported assertions, or that could vary by geography. None of them revealed F2 inheritance.] 4. daf-7p::GFP imaging experiments (Fig. 1D, F, H) – Hunter and colleagues do not report seeing increased daf-7p::gfp expression in the P0 generation. Increased daf-7p::gfp expression after exposure to PA14 has been reported by multiple groups7, not just ours, and is usually not small or highly variable, as it is due to the combination of bacterial cues and P11 small RNA; if they cannot replicate this basic result, it suggests that something is seriously wrong with their protocols or technique, or their worms are very sick, even before trying to use our protocol to train worms. [As we note in the manuscript (page 5, first paragraph), the discovery of PA14 induced daf-7p::gfp expression in ASI neurons (Meisel et al. 2014), which to our knowledge is the only other published work that reports PA14 induced daf-7p::gfp expression, was performed at 25°C. All of our experiments performed at 25°C show increased expression upon PA14 training (Figure 2), and thus our results are in line with the cited data. And yes, we were concerned about the health of the FK181 (rol-6; daf-7p::gfp) strain when maintained according to the suggested protocol and therefore obtained a single-copy integrated reporter strain QL296. Analysis of this strain did not enable detection of F2 inheritance of the response (Figure 2).] 5. Additionally, they do not report the expression of daf-7p::gfp in the ASJ neuron7, which is very strange, since we have been able to reliably replicate Meisel, et al.’s finding in the P0 generation. Therefore, it is not clear from which neuron the authors are quantifying daf-7p::gfp levels. [We did visually confirm daf-7p::gfp expression in ASJ neurons upon training in all experiments, however as we were interested in the transgenerational aspect of the reported response and ASJ expression of this marker is not reported as being transgenerational in Moore et al.(2019) or follow-up studies, the expression of the marker in these neurons was never quantitatively measured or analyzed.] 6. Instead of imaging and reporting fluorescence levels in individual neurons, the authors averaged fluorescence intensity/worm, which is explicitly not what we did or others have done, because different neurons in each worm can have different intensities – particularly if they are the ASI rather than ASJ neurons. [We did not use “averaged fluorescence intensity/worm”. We generated an average fluorescence intensity in each neuron and then averaged the values of the two neurons together, as we do not believe that the two neurons can be treated as truly independent data points. Indeed, we are concerned that the visible bimodality sometimes observed when looking at all neurons independently compromises some statistical tests. However, we did also present the single neuron data, analyzed exactly as specified in Moore et al., (2019) in Figure S2. No differences in the overall trend of the data are observed in this alternate analysis method. This is all described in the methods.] 7. While we see modest decreases in fertility after PA14 training, the authors report severe decreases in fertility: about one fifth of normal egg production, and a severe developmental delay) in their F1 generation that we do not observe. Both facts indicate that their worms are very sick, even the worms that have not been exposed to PA14. If their worms are extremely sick, it might account for the small number of progeny, poor imaging results, and a developmental delay that shifted the training times. This could be a result of overbleaching, which causes developmental delays; the bleaching protocol described in Gainey et al. deviates from our published protocol. Additionally, they add Triton X100 to their final M9 wash, which is used (although at a higher concentration) to permeabilize embryos in other protocols. We are not aware of any bleaching protocols that include Triton in a wash step, and our lab certainly does not; this addition might also damage the progeny. [Supplemental Table S1 states which experiments did or did not use Triton X100 (0.01%) in the final wash step to prevent embryos from sticking to plastic. No F2 response was observed in any of the six experiments in which Triton X100 was not used. Triton X100 was not used for choice assay experiments. We are unclear as to how Professor Murphy estimated fecundity and developmental rates from our presented data. In early trials we failed to recover sufficient PA14 trained F1 embryos to proceed with multi-generational experiments.  We extended the period of growth for P0 animals from bleach synchronization (embryos) to training (late L4/young adult) from 48-52 hours to 56-60 hours (Note that in the Star Protocol (Moore et al., 2021) the pre-training growth period was adjusted to 52-56 hours).  As described in the text, this slight change enabled us to reproducibly obtain sufficient fertile PA14 trained F1 animals. As suggested by this comment, perhaps our training conditions are too harsh, although that doesn’t explain why extending the growth period prior to training by 4 hours compensates for the harsh training. An alternate possibility is that the adult worms we obtain bleach-synchronized P0 embryos from are not holding their eggs in utero, thus our recovered bleached embryos are ~4 hours younger than are the bleach-synchronized embryos isolated in the Murphy lab. I know from unfortunate experience that frequent bleaching of worm stocks very quickly selects for Egl variants (holding more eggs). Unintentional selection is one reason we perform a lab-wide N2 replacement thaw 2-3X per year. Other variations in growth conditions can also affect egg laying in adult worms. As we state in the manuscript, there is no indication that the extended growth period interfered with training.] Figure 2 1. P0 imaging data suggest that the daf-7p::gfp response to PA14 is not reproducible in their hands; again, this has nothing to do with our paper or protocols, but rather appears that they cannot replicate previous results in the field that precedes our work. [See above.] 2. Does “25°C” mean that the worms were grown at or assayed at 25°C, or both? [To clarify the statements in the main text of the paper and Supplemental Table S1: in all 25°C experiments, animals were kept at 25°C for at least one generation before the experiment began, grown at 25°C until the start of training, trained at 25°C, and then maintained at 25°C in the F1 and F2 generations. ] This high temperature is generally hard on the worms. [Yes, 25°C growth may be mildly stressful to the worms, but whether it is caused by the increased growth rate or due to increased E. coli pathogenicity has, to our knowledge, not been determined. ] 3. Technical note: it appears that instead of consistently picking fluorescent daf-7p::gfp animals, the authors “chunked” large groups of worms, resulting in populations of non-fluorescent animals in their experiments. [While ‘chunking’ was generally performed for maintenance of this line, as is standard practice in many labs for maintaining integrated arrays, when rare non-Rollers were observed, rollers were subsequently selected by picking for maintenance of the population. In no case were maintenance plates ever observed to have large populations of non-Rol or non-fluorescent animals. When we purposefully stressed the animals for multiple generations to document the instability of this integrated line, then we occasionally observed a large fraction of non-fluorescent worms (Table S3). ] 4. Scale of P0 and F1 are extremely different (due to sickness of the P0s?). [The enhanced daf-7p::gfp response in the PA14 trained animals in the F1 generation led us to plot the data on a log scale both to better visualize data points at the extremes and to plot multigenerational data in the same figure. Since we do not have access to the raw data from Moore et al., we were unable to compare our data to the published results in the same format. We hereby make our third request for all of the data used to generate the figures presented in Moore et al., (2019). We would have liked to plot our data alongside the data from Moore et al., (2019) using identical analysis pipelines. We believe this would have helpful for our trouble-shooting. The P0 animals recovered after 24 hours on PA14 are clearly not healthy, and we imagine the same is true for similar animals in the Murphy lab. As described above, the assumption of general sickness is more reasonably explained by the age of the bleach recovered embryos.] Figure 3 1. Notes that panels A, C, and D are repeated from Figure 1. [Yes, in this summary figure we included the previous data and noted this in the legend. We were not, as implied by this comment, surreptitiously duplicating data presentation. However, this comment does provide an opportunity to note that Moore et al., (2019) contains apparent unacknowledged re-use of control data in multiple figures. We say apparent because we don’t have access to the underlying data. The two most serious instances are in Figure 1. Figure 1G and 1H contrast choice assays with different pathogens (PA14 and S. marcescens vs OP50) but appear to have identical naïve worm (control) results. This is highly unlikely. Figure 1J and 1I contrast different training regimes, yet again, appear to plot the same P0 control data for both conditions (although to be fair, the statistical significance is different). Similar patterns are apparent in Figure 4B and 4D; 4C, 5D and S4B; 4E, 5G, 5H, 5I and S4F; 6G and 6H; S1A and S1B; S4A and S4E; S4C, S4D, and S4G; and S5B, S5C, and S5D. In several cases the reported statistical significance is different for apparently identical distributions. Some of this apparent re-use of control data is not obvious as the scale and graph sizes are not standardized between plots. We acknowledge that in the absence of the raw data, we cannot be certain that the similarity of the control data in these figures is just coincidental. If these experiments share the same control data (other than Figure 1), we believe it should be acknowledged in the figure legends.] 2. The authors discuss “OP50 aversion” but this does not make sense, since both trained and untrained animals are placed on HGs after bleaching. [OP50 aversion is the mirror image of PA14 preference. We choose this term “OP50 aversion”  to highlight the mild-pathogenicity of E. coli to worms, which is a likely mechanism to explain the phenomenon.] 3. Their naïve in F1 is sometimes even lower than in the P0 (Fig. 3D). [Yes, these observations led in part to the hypothesis that the transition from growth on NG OP50 (during P0 training) to HG OP50 (during F1 growth) enhanced OP50 aversion, which we tested explicitly (Figure 4).] 4. There is no consistency in their results across replicates, within experiments, or across figures of the paper – not just the inability to see an F2 effect, but in their naïve chemotaxes, P0 trained choice indices, and F1 results; the authors claim that their F1 assays are reproducible, but only 3 out of the 9 assays in this figure show F1 learned avoidance. [Yes, it is a noisy assay that requires the presentation of all replicate data.] 5. In 3J, data that are not replicates, as they have been performed using different conditions, have been pooled. [Yes, it is a display of aggregated data transparently presented in the manuscript (data points, not means and error bars). That is why we refer to them as “results”, not “replicates” in the figure legend.] 6. Gainey et al. observe substantial variation in behavior between training plates (Figure 3, table 2, S2 annotated protocol), and incorrectly treat each training plate as a biological replicate, rather than a technical replicate. (Each training plate is seeded and grown in the same conditions, and worms from the same bleached population are added onto the plates, therefore these are not biological replicates but rather technical replicates; biological replicates require starting with different worm populations and carrying out the whole experiment independently.) In our hands, behavior from a set of training plates is always consistent. [We can disagree on the definition of biological replicates. We explicitly tested individual P0 populations (both individual plates and pooled plates) and noted variation. Thus, for us, the worms’ experience of PA14 can measurably vary. The worms from these training plates can be pooled to distribute the variation to the next generation or the plates can be kept separate to maintain the biological variability present in each individually trained population.] 7. Additionally, we note that the authors use the same population of worms for the choice assays and subsequently for bleaching, meaning that worms are held in liquid for an extended time before bleaching; this may cause worms additional stress which may interfere with behavior. [The worms in M9 that are being distributed to choice plates sit in this last wash for less than 3 additional minutes prior to the addition of bleach solution. And as opposed to a 3-5 minute-long wash as the worms settle (to avoid centrifugation) these worms are being gently resuspended every 10-15 seconds. Compared to the 30 seconds of extreme stress before death in bleach, the “extra” stress of a few more minutes of aerated swimming is minimal. I recognize this as an assertion and have designed an experiment to test it. ] Figure 4 1. OP50 growth conditions: this would only matter if the controls and experimentals were grown on different plate types, which is not the case (but if the authors are in fact putting the controls on different plates from experimentals, then the experiment is done incorrectly). [Changing the plates between NG OP50 and HG OP50 E. coli growth conditions impacts the measurement of learned avoidance (Figure 4). Furthermore, the progeny of the two trained populations, following PA14 and OP50 training, each have a different experience prior to growth on HG (one from NG OP50 and the other from NG PA14). It is possible that the combination of recent history and current conditions produce an unanticipated, integrated result. This experiment was exploratory, not explanatory. We agree, as noted in the text, that the experimental design implicitly controls for the change in growth conditions.] Figure 5 1. We also found that sid-1 and sid-2 are required, but since their controls are inconsistent (Fig. 3) in the first place, it is hard to know how to interpret their data. [This is a fair point. In most of these experiments the N2 control experiments performed in parallel were only carried to the F1, thus the data was not included in the paper. In one experiment the N2 worms spotted on the choice plate were contaminated with carry-over bacteria and not scored. On revision we can add the available WT parallel data. We note that the WT data only confirms that the choice plates on that day were working as expected. We think these are very interesting results and are currently investigating how these genes, identified as RNA transporters, affect intergenerational responses.] 2. Other mutants (rde-1, hrde-1, sid-1, sid-2) – still show increased daf-7p::gfp in F1 – again, these data are hard to interpret since they do not show a wild-type control that worked here. This also has little bearing on our work since other training paradigms (e.g., 4- and 8-hour training that engages small RNA-independent pathways) also induce daf-7p::gfp. It is also unclear which neuron (ASI vs ASJ) they are imaging. [The response of these four mutants are indistinguishable from WT , thus, there is no need for a WT control. We speculate that the apparently more reliable P0 response in the mutant experiments presented here is due to the fact that these mutants were constructed using the single-copy reporter strain, QL296, which appears to yield a more reliable 20°C P0 response than FK181 (Figure 2, S2). Regarding the concern about neuron identity: as stated in our response to the comment on Figure 1, we did observe a response in the ASJ neurons upon PA14 training, but this neuron was excluded from measurement and analysis. All presented data are from ASI neurons.]",2024-06-10T01:10:06,disqus_EPCF1dI6WB,Craig Hunter,10.1101/2024.06.01.596941,Irreproducibility of transgenerational learned pathogen-aversion response in C. elegans,"D.

I previously made a detailed assessment of these which are found in the comments of Gainey et al., bioRxiv 2024. In my opinion the debate to whether the effect can be triggered under highly specific lab conditions is not particularly relevant. But I think the point is that if the effect is so sensitive to such artificial conditions (or one sRNA that is only expressed under even more specific conditions), then how physiologically important can it be in nature? CM's group points to their 2024 (Sengupta et al, plos genet) paper testing various bacteria C. elegans may be exposed to the wild. However, it seems that worms naively avoid OP50 (i.e. ‘prefer’ test bacteria) in essentially every comparison made by CM. This is contrary to reports by other labs (PMID: 38228683, PMID: 38228683) and potentially a more serious concern with the assay. Furthermore, in the 2024 Sengupta paper, it seems that both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria can trigger avoidance (or not), which is odd and makes me think the effect is rather random. If this is really something so specific or adaptive that prevents worms from infection or confers fitness - I believe CM refers to the effect as the worms ""reading"" bacterial sRNAs in their Nature papers (is there any evidence that the recognition sequence on maco-1 mRNA co-evolves with bacterial preference in wild nematode isolates?) - then wouldn't the worms have evolved at least some preference for avoiding pathogenic vs non pathogenic bacteria from their habitat? To me it just seems that random bacterial sRNAs that may be complementary to some worm genes that regulate behavior (I mean, you would expect to see some matches among a panel of total bacterial small RNAs from many species worms are exposed to versus total worm mRNAs...) are being silenced through an RNAi like mechanism... It's not news that RNAi can be inherited, which was described nearly two decades ago and is a well understood process. Perhaps Hunter et al should visit CM's lab to learn the technique, but given how meaningful the assay/readout is in my view (and how already overstudied/saturated sRNA based inheritance is), perhaps it is not the best investment of time and effort.",2024-06-08T16:21:26,reviewer6,Reviewer 6,10.1101/2024.06.07.597568,Absence of Evidence is Not Evidence of Absence: The many flaws in the case against transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of pathogen avoidance in C. elegans,"Rachel Kaletsky, Rebecca Moore, Titas Sengupta, Renee Seto, Coleen T.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.01.596941v2#comment-6475951604,biorxivstage,3,"I am a C. elegans researcher with some familiarity with the topics discussed. I do not personally know, nor have I interacted with any of the authors involved. I have read in detail both the preprint and the response in the comments. Below I provide some comments in the hope that they will hone arguments from both sides. For brevity, I refer to the authors of this preprint as “the authors” and Dr. Coleen Murphy as “CM”. Summary: In my view, there are two issues here (1): the technical reproducibility of the choice assay; and (2) the physiological importance of CM’s results in a natural setting given the points raised by the authors. While CM makes some valid arguments on (1) – the authors should really have shown at least a few assays that attempted to follow the protocol exactly as stated by CM – the deviations here are in my view minor enough to raise significant questions about the choice assay and its interpretation. I believe the authors are justified in stating that (2) if the variables discussed here indeed significantly obscure detection of the phenotype, then the ecological significance of the inherited learned avoidance in a natural setting is in question. This is especially important given that, contrary to CM’s response, the authors do in fact see learned avoidance of PA14 as well as daf-7 expression at P0 and F1 in some experiments (indicating that the learning was induced) but not beyond in the F2 progeny of these same worms which displayed learned avoidance. Below is a detailed discussion of these points. Specific comments: -	CM states that the lack of naïve PA14 preference seen by the authors is a “serious cause for concern”. In CM’s 2024 paper (Fig 1, https://journals.plos.org/p..., worms are tested for bacterial food choice between OP50 (the lab food) versus bacterial species C. elegans may be exposed to in the wild. However, it seems that worms naively avoid OP50 (i.e. ‘prefer’ test bacteria) in essentially every comparison made by CM. This is contrary to reports by other labs (PMID: 38228683, PMID: 38228683) and in my view potentially a more serious concern with the assay. Contrary to CM’s assertion, while CM’s group and others see *mild* PA14 preference in naïve worms, other groups also do not observe such a preference in naïve worms or report more variable results (e.g., PMID: 21172617, PMID: 28877481, PMID: 31371455). Overall, the authors did replicate P0 and F1 learned avoidance in some runs and had a “learning index” consistent with prior reports in these experiments, so I do not see how the lack of purported naïve PA14 preference (which is quite minor and variable to begin with) is a significant concern here. -	Looking at the authors’ raw data (table S2) for individual experiments, it seems the authors used <200 worms as advised by CM for most of their plates. The “up to 770 on a spot” was from a single plate, so I do not think this would change the conclusions of the authors. The authors compared worm density with choice index and found that there is no correlation within the ranges tested here. -	“no azide or other paralytic used” (CM) – the authors claim to have tested this and state that addition of azide did not affect their results. They also claim that worms make a choice within 15 minutes and do not leave the respective lawn in the first hour of the assay. But none of this data is shown (it should be). -       It seems that CM’s group counts worms in proximity to lawns “if they are within a few millimeters of the bacterial spot.” (STAR protocol). This may introduce systemic bias given the OP50 and PA14 lawns are clearly visibly distinct. Again, this raises questions to me regarding the reliability of this assay for interpreting minute effects and making broad generalizations. -	Aspirating worms for counting would be unlikely to affect results. -	The fact that conditions tested by the authors are varied between experiments is in my view a strength of this study given they did not observe F2 effects in any of their tests (you would normally change parameters rather than keep repeating the same protocol if you were unable to reproduce something, no?). However, testing variables/conditions such as temperature, light/dark etc. are informative only in a context where the authors have first fully followed through on the exact CM protocol with no deviations. So, I do think it is crucial to show a few attempts where the protocol is followed exactly as stated by CM. -	The use of Triton X after bleaching may be a concern as CM points out. Though seemingly low (0.01%), this may hypothetically make bleached (i.e. already somewhat stressed) embryos or newly hatched L1s more vulnerable to pathogenic bacteria or alter their physiology. I do not see a point in including Triton X during or after bleaching, it is not standard nor required and is certainly a confounding variable. However, given the CMC of Triton X is 0.02% and the authors use below this concentration and only during plating, I would be surprised if this led to a dramatic change in the phenotype observed. -	I do not find CM’s critique on daf-7 expression to be substantive. CM asserts that the authors do not see elevated daf-7p::gfp expression. Except they do! Which is especially evident with the single copy (SC) construct Fig 2 under SC at both 20 and 25oC. The magnitude of P0 daf-7 increase with the SC construct (~2 fold) is similar to what other groups observe at this generation (albeit with the multicopy strain, so it is hard to compare). I think the use of a single copy reporter is a strength of this paper, but in the future assays of daf-7 expression should really be done using endogenous CRISPR/Cas9 reporters. That an F2 response is not observed in runs where there is a high upregulation in the F1 generation is consistent with the authors’ interpretation. -	The authors should show representative images of what is being quantified as CM states, as without this we do not know which neurons are being assayed. I do not think averaging both ASI neurons in a worm is a concern – even if there is an increase in one ASI, it would still be reflected in the average (as long as the correct neuron is being quantified). It may even reduce variability or bimodality to average the two, given the brightness of reporters on a confocal image can depend on the depth of the imaging plane as the authors state. -	CM states that chunking is an unusual way to maintain the fluorescent strain. But this is a genomically INTEGRATED multi copy array (ksIs2), no? The point of the authors is that the fluorescence expression and associated Rol marker are unstable in their expression, which is not unusual for such integrated repetitive multicopy arrays. This is not an extrachromosomal array wherein fluorescent worms need to be picked to maintain the array, so CM’s statement that it is “standard accepted practice” to do so is simply wrong. In fact I find it quite concerning if CM’s group picks fluorescent worms to maintain this strain as it biases the worms for an epigenetic state in which the integrant is poised for expression, which may indicate other epigenetic issues in the strain’s background (i.e., lack of silencing of repetitive sequences). The instability of this strain I assume is why the authors obtained a single copy daf-7 reporter, which in any case would supersede any results obtained from a multicopy array. CM says nothing about the single copy integrant results, and I believe that given the authors observe P0 and F1 upregulation with the single copy integrant, I think the case is solid that there is no response observed in F2 worms from F1s showing daf-7 upregulation. An endogenous CRISPR/Cas9 reporter (e.g., transcriptional/SL2::GFP if a translational fusion is not possible) would really push home this point. -	CM states that the authors replicates show poor “consistency”. However, we can only see this because the authors, unlike CM, show each experiment independently! We have no idea whether every experiment CM performed actually displayed learned avoidance behaviour, given the source data for CM’s choice assays is apparently not public. CM’s reports only show all learning experiments in aggregate, and I believe if the authors aggregated all their runs herein to a single plot, they would indeed see a seemingly ‘consistent’ avoidance effect. CM could easily address this by releasing raw/source data for choice/learning assays. -	CM claims that in their hands behaviour from a set of training plates is ‘always’ consistent, but data are not shown. Both sides need to avoid making important claims without showing data. -	CM states that the authors use of the same population to assay and then maintain for the next generation may confound the results. Again, the authors need to do the assay exactly as stated by CM, but if a few extra minutes of suspension in buffer really so obscures the phenotype beyond any detection, then how ecologically relevant can it possibly be? To my knowledge, there is no major phenotype that is completely ablated by a few minutes additional incubation in buffer. By this standard nothing involving washing off worms in a buffer would be interpretable. -	It is interesting that sid-1 and 2 mutants do not show a learned F1 avoidance, but daf-7 expression is still elevated. It may be sufficient to have one SID protein for elevated daf-7 expression in progeny but require both for the behavior. Given both sid-1 and 2 are RNA transport channels, without double mutants and reliable daf-7 readout from an endogenous reporter, it is difficult for either group to infer any epistatic relationships between these genes. -	I read the protocol file with notes from CM. I did not find any changes that are severe enough to cause concern and it seems that these are more clarifications/updates than changes to the fundamental principles of the assay. I also did not find the authors’ statements on this disingenuous, as there were clearly differences between the original STAR protocol and the updates provided. It is important for both parties here to refrain from personal attacks and address the substance of the arguments made. -	I did find that some details in the STAR protocol were excessive, e.g., the height of plate stacks. I appreciate the detail but again, this raises the question that if such artificial variables really influence the phenotype so severely that it is no longer at all detectable, how physiologically relevant or robust can the phenotype be? -	The statistical error in the STAR protocol pointed out by the authors: it seems either CM is misinterpreting a two-way ANOVA or that this was an oversight. I did not find this point too important overall as correcting such a statistical error would not change the conclusion of CM’s papers given the magnitude of effects previously described. -	CM states that expression of P11 is essential for TEI. In CM’s 2020 paper (Kaletsky et al) it is stated that: “moreover, training on a P11 mutant that disrupts the perfect match to maco-1 but conserves P11 secondary structure induced no avoidance (Fig. 4e)”. As written, it seems essential not just for TEI (F2 effect) but also the P0 learning itself (unless CM can clarify that it is only required for the F2+ effect and that in Fig 4e only F2+ are being tested). So as I understand it, if lack of P11 expression is the issue, then there should be no P0 or F1 avoidance at all in any of these runs. Given the authors do not see an F2 effect in worms with robust P0 and F1 responses, it seems that this point is moot. I also do not think the authors can be blamed for any putative lack of P11 expression as it seems that for this portion (PA14 growth) they adhered to the protocol quite closely and explored various PA14 lines including those obtained from CM’s and other labs. In summary, I think CM’s response is insufficient to alleviate many of the key concerns raised by the authors herein. I do not believe the lack of naïve PA14 attraction is a major concern, as there are literature examples where (a quite minor) naïve PA14 attraction is not observed. Furthermore, this is also confounded by CM’s recent (2024) paper wherein their worms prefer essentially every bacterium among a panel over OP50 in a naïve test, again contrary to prior reports from other labs. This makes me question the robustness as well as any broad conclusions that can be drawn from this assay. The authors do also observe P0/F1 learned avoidance and elevated daf-7 expression contrary to CM’s rebuttal. I agree that the effects shown are not consistent between experiments here, but we cannot say whether this is simply because we are seeing here individual runs of inherently inconsistent assays whereas looking at an aggregate of data in CM’s papers (since the source data for the choice assays are not public). The major concern is that in those populations with P0/F1 responses (meaning the learning has been successfully induced), there is no further inheritance of avoidance beyond F1, and similarly for daf-7 wherein populations expressing high daf-7 at P0 and F1 do not transmit this to progeny. I believe this precludes “basic concerns about [the authors’] bacterial and C. elegans growth conditions, assay conditions, and assay techniques”. Overall, while it is important for the authors to show a few runs where the protocol is followed exactly as described by CM, I believe the deviations here are minor enough that even if they were able to replicate the transgenerational effect successfully, the sensitivity of the effect to such minutia would greatly diminish its physiological relevance to the worms - and its importance as an adaptive paradigm of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance - in a natural setting. I also do not find it constructive for any party involved to address anything other than the scientific substance of arguments or engage in personal attacks. Given the attention and broad reach these studies have garnered, as well as the important implications, it is essential – and the normal course of the scientific endeavor – for such claims to be rigorously tested. I also very much appreciate that the authors have shared these observations, and find it very commendable that CM has responded in a timely and comprehensive manner (as well as been responsive to the authors in refining their protocol).",2024-06-07T16:53:51,reviewer6,Reviewer 6,10.1101/2024.06.01.596941,Irreproducibility of transgenerational learned pathogen-aversion response in C. elegans,"D.

The tertiary structure of this protein is essentially the same as that of Cus17, the 17 kDa phloem exudate lectin from Cucumis sativus (Bobbili et al. (2023) Structure 31, 1-16).  Hence the term “archetypal” used in the title is misleading and hence it should be removed. Nictaba is homologous to PP2 family proteins from Cucurbitaceae and other species. Some background information about PP2 proteins is relevant here. Two major proteins, phloem proteins 1 and 2 (short form PP1 and PP2) in the sieve elements of plants were studied since early 1970s by several groups (Sabnis and Hart (1973) Planta, 142, 97-101; Allen (1979) Biochem. J. 183, 133-137; Read & Northcote (1983) Planta 158, 119-127; Read & Northcote (1983) Eur. J. Biochem. 134, 561-567). That PP2 is a lectin was well established in these studies and its activity was clearly shown to be inhibited by oligomers of GlcNAc and by N-linked glycopeptides by Allen (Biochem. J. (1979) 183, 133-137). The PP2 proteins have been found in a wide variety of plant species, both monocots and dicots. In 1986 Anantharam et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14621-14627) clearly established that the chitobiosyl core of N-linked glycopeptides is crucial for binding of the phloem exudate lectin from Luffa acutangula (ridge gourd) as treatment of the N-linked glycans with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H completely abrogated their binding. While some of these early workers did not consistently use the designation PP2 protein while describing these lectins, over the last 30 years the term ‘PP2 proteins’ is commonly used by scientists working on these proteins. In fact, Gary Thompson’s group, who have extensively investigated the PP2 family genes referred to these proteins as a Superfamily (Dinant et al. (2003) Plant Physiol. 131, 115-131) and also referred to the Nicotiana tabacum lectin as a PP2-like agglutinin. Now Els Van Damme’s group, which has been working on plant lectins for over 3 decades refers to other PP2 family lectins that were investigated from much earlier as Nictaba-related lectins. This is a gross violation of scientific propriety and Nictaba should be referred to as a member of the PP2 Superfamily of proteins. Since the high-resolution crystal structure of Cus17 is already known, and the structure of Nictaba is highly similar to it, the same should be mentioned in the Abstract, Introduction and Discussion sections in an appropriate manner. In particular, in Discussion section (para 2) the sentence “A similar crystal structure was reported recently for the phloem lectin from Cucumis sativus (Cus17), a member of the Nictaba-related lectin family” should be modified to indicate that “the first crystal structure of the PP2 fold to which Nictaba belongs”. In fact, the narrative of referring to all PP2 family lectins as Nictaba-related lectins at various places in the manuscript should be changed and Nictaba should be referred to as PP2 family protein. In the light of the fact that the structural fold of Nictaba is quite similar to that of Cus17, it would be appropriate to give a detailed comparison of the Nictaba structure with Cus17 structure. Since the glycan array investigations on Nictaba have been reported earlier by the same group (Lannoo et al. (2006) FEBS Lett. 580, 6329-6337;  Schouppe et al. (2010) Glycoconj. J. 27, 613–623) the discussion on this aspect should be condensed. Importantly, the glycan array data is at best semi-quantitative and the authors should have used a method like ITC (Isothermal Titration Calorimetry) which gives reliable and quantitative information on not only the association (binding) constants, but also important additional information on the carbohydrate binding by the lectin, viz., stoichiometry, enthalpy and entropy associated with the binding. Although extensive studies on the binding of chitooligosaccharides to phloem exudate lectins have been reported, especially employing ITC, the authors cited just one paper published in 2011 (Narahari et al. (2011) J. Phys. Chem. B. 115, 4110–4117). Since then several ITC studies on chitooligosaccharide binding to PP2 family lectins have been reported (reviewed by Swamy et al. (2022) Phytochemistry, Article No. 113251.) This information should be suitably cited. Also, the study of Bobbili et al. (2023) on Cus17 also reports extensive ITC studies on the binding of various chitooligosaccharides and the N-linked glycan, Man3GlcNAc2 to the lectin. It is important to cite this work while discussing the carbohydrate binding characteristics of Nictaba.",2024-06-07T04:15:26,disqus_PhYtUCfQYu,Swamy,10.1101/2024.05.06.592670,The crystal structure of the archetypical Nictaba plant lectin reveals the molecular basis for its carbohydrate-binding properties,"Yehudi Bloch, Vinicius Jose Da Silva Osterne, Savvas N.

(A-C) It has been reported by many groups that PA14 is mildly attractive to C. elegans, that is, given a choice between PA14 and OP50, worms choose PA141,2. However, in almost every assay shown in this paper, the worms prefer OP50 over PA14 – that is, they are already avoiding PA14 - prior to training (naïve preference), which is odd. This suggests that the authors are not using conditions that are standard, either in PA14 or OP50 growth or in choice assays (see note about choice assay performance). This is a serious cause for concern that is independent of any training conditions. In fact, as far as we can see, in only one case (Fig. 1C, F1) did their experiments replicate the naïve choice results observed by other groups. 2.	Choice assays: their “choice assays” involve putting 3-4x the recommended number of worms on a plate (up to 770 on a spot!), letting them roam for variable amounts of time (“30-60 minutes”) without trapping them (no azide or other paralytic used), and then putting them in a 4°C incubator (which does not immediately halt worm movement), then counting them. None of this follows our published choice assay protocols, or the standard chemotaxis assay protocol3–6. Putting more than 200 worms on a single plate can lead to altered choice because of crowding. In the absence of a paralytic, worms change their preference due to various factors, including adaptation; therefore, in this case, the worms’ first choice (which is what we measure in all our assays) is not being measured. They also count the worms by “aspirating” the worms off of the plate, which is not standard in any behavioral assays, as far as we know. 3.	Table 2 and Figure 1: There are almost no true replicates, as in each experiment, at least one or more condition is changed. (For example, the authors only tested the PA14 we sent them in one replicate - Exp 3). 4.	daf-7p::GFP imaging experiments (Fig. 1D, F, H) – Hunter and colleagues do not report seeing increased daf-7p::gfp expression in the P0 generation. Increased daf-7p::gfp expression after exposure to PA14 has been reported by multiple groups7, not just ours, and is usually not small or highly variable, as it is due to the combination of bacterial cues and P11 small RNA; if they cannot replicate this basic result, it suggests that something is seriously wrong with their protocols or technique, or their worms are very sick, even before trying to use our protocol to train worms. 5.	Additionally, they do not report the expression of daf-7p::gfp in the ASJ neuron7, which is very strange, since we have been able to reliably replicate Meisel, et al.’s finding in the P0 generation. Therefore, it is not clear from which neuron the authors are quantifying daf-7p::gfp levels. 6.	Instead of imaging and reporting fluorescence levels in individual neurons, the authors averaged fluorescence intensity/worm, which is explicitly not what we did or others have done, because different neurons in each worm can have different intensities – particularly if they are the ASI rather than ASJ neurons. 7.	While we see modest decreases in fertility after PA14 training, the authors report severe decreases in fertility: about one fifth of normal egg production, and a severe developmental delay) in their F1 generation that we do not observe. Both facts indicate that their worms are very sick, even the worms that have not been exposed to PA14. If their worms are extremely sick, it might account for the small number of progeny, poor imaging results, and a developmental delay that shifted the training times. This could be a result of overbleaching, which causes developmental delays; the bleaching protocol described in Gainey et al. deviates from our published protocol. Additionally, they add Triton X100 to their final M9 wash, which is used (although at a higher concentration) to permeabilize embryos in other protocols. We are not aware of any bleaching protocols that include Triton in a wash step, and our lab certainly does not; this addition might also damage the progeny. Figure 2 1.	P0 imaging data suggest that the daf-7p::gfp response to PA14 is not reproducible in their hands; again, this has nothing to do with our paper or protocols, but rather appears that they cannot replicate previous results in the field that precedes our work. 2.	Does “25°C” mean that the worms were grown at or assayed at 25°C, or both? This high temperature is generally hard on the worms. 3.	Technical note: it appears that instead of consistently picking fluorescent daf-7p::gfp animals, the authors “chunked” large groups of worms, resulting in populations of non-fluorescent animals in their experiments. 4.	Scale of P0 and F1 are extremely different (due to sickness of the P0s?). Figure 3 1.	Notes that panels A, C, and D are repeated from Figure 1. 2.	The authors discuss “OP50 aversion” but this does not make sense, since both trained and untrained animals are placed on HGs after bleaching. 3.	Their naïve in F1 is sometimes even lower than in the P0 (Fig. 3D). 4.	There is no consistency in their results across replicates, within experiments, or across figures of the paper – not just the inability to see an F2 effect, but in their naïve chemotaxes, P0 trained choice indices, and F1 results; the authors claim that their F1 assays are reproducible, but only 3 out of the 9 assays in this figure show F1 learned avoidance. 5.	In 3J, data that are not replicates, as they have been performed using different conditions, have been pooled. 6.	Gainey et al. observe substantial variation in behavior between training plates (Figure 3, table 2, S2 annotated protocol), and incorrectly treat each training plate as a biological replicate, rather than a technical replicate. (Each training plate is seeded and grown in the same conditions, and worms from the same bleached population are added onto the plates, therefore these are not biological replicates but rather technical replicates; biological replicates require starting with different worm populations and carrying out the whole experiment independently.) In our hands, behavior from a set of training plates is always consistent. 7.	Additionally, we note that the authors use the same population of worms for the choice assays and subsequently for bleaching, meaning that worms are held in liquid for an extended time before bleaching; this may cause worms additional stress which may interfere with behavior. Figure 4 1. OP50 growth conditions: this would only matter if the controls and experimentals were grown on different plate types, which is not the case (but if the authors are in fact putting the controls on different plates from experimentals, then the experiment is done incorrectly). Figure 5 1.	We also found that sid-1 and sid-2 are required, but since their controls are inconsistent (Fig. 3) in the first place, it is hard to know how to interpret their data. 2.	Other mutants (rde-1, hrde-1, sid-1, sid-2) – still show increased daf-7p::gfp in F1 – again, these data are hard to interpret since they do not show a wild-type control that worked here. This also has little bearing on our work since other training paradigms (e.g., 4- and 8-hour training that engages small RNA-independent pathways) also induce daf-7p::gfp. It is also unclear which neuron (ASI vs ASJ) they are imaging. Discussion 1.	daf-7p::gfp - Picking fluorescent worms or rollers is standard worm husbandry; it is not a “result” to say that they noticed that Rol can be lost – but it does indicate that they should have discarded any results that they obtained before noticing that the array might have been lost in the worms they assayed. The fact that they have brought this up more than once suggests that they are not using standard accepted practices to maintain transgenic lines. 2.	Dennis Kim’s work on phenazine-induced avoidance has been oddly neglected in this work7. Kim’s group found that phenazine-1-carboxamide induces Pdaf-7::gfp expression in the ASJ neuron, which we see quite reliably in our assays as well. No Pdaf-7::gfp imaging of the ASJ neuron is presented in this work, suggesting that either the PA14 they grew also did not make phenazines, or their image analysis is unreliable. 3.	They made a lot of changes to our protocol (temperatures, light/dark, etc). We cannot find in this paper a single example of an experiment that followed our protocol entirely. 4.	The authors make a point of calling OP50 a pathogen, which is odd; C. elegans grown on OP50 typically live for 2-3 weeks. They cite Garigan et al. 20028, which showed that when worms get old (past 15 days) eventually the pharynx stops grinding up bacteria and the gut will start to fill up with OP50, and killing bacteria does slightly extend lifespan - but this is not an effect observed in young (Day 1) animals on the short timescales used in the experiments here. In any case, since both control and trained animals are grown on HG plates with OP50, it cannot explain the behavior of the control animals. 5.	The authors also never replicate the “bias towards Pseudomonas in choice assays ((Ha et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2017; Moore et al., 2019)” – Those papers also used OP50 vs PA14 to demonstrate this bias towards Pseudomonas, so it is unclear how the author think that their failure to replicate this basic finding is somehow supportive of any of their arguments. It is more likely that there is something fundamentally wrong in their initial conditions that have prevented the replication of all other groups’ findings, not just ours. Moreover, in our experiments, other than the 24 hrs of training on PA14 vs OP50, our control and trained animals are always on the same plates. This argument makes no sense, unless the authors have introduced an additional variable of plating control worms on one kind of plate/bacteria and their trained animals on a different plate/bacteria (which we do not do). 6.	It is unclear why the authors grew worms at different temperatures. 20°C is the standard temperature for worm growth and assays. 7.	In our hands, naïve OP50-PA14 choice index is not significantly different between P0 (when NGM plates are used) and the subsequent generations (when HG plates are used).  The survival assay correlates well with the idea that their worms are very sick, much sicker than we see in our assays, although the sparse intervals in both assays make it difficult to draw any conclusions – not possible to draw the conclusion that the bacteria are “more lethal” since they are trying to compare two lifespans from different labs etc. - but if they are, it might be due to their PA14 cultivation conditions or the health of their worms. But the fact that they see massive leaving and desiccation of worms, they might indeed be growing PA14 under much more pathogenic conditions. 8.	The authors state: “Near the conclusion of these experiments, we received an updated protocol that included several clarifying edits and additional deviations from the published protocols (C. Murphy, Personal communication).” We clarified our protocols, we didn’t “deviate” from them. This is a concerning way to present our email communications in which we tried to correct errors in their protocol and offer constructive advice; we even extended an invitation to Hunter to visit our lab to learn the assay. We are happy to provide these emails if necessary. In order to help others, we continuously update our lab’s protocols to make clarifications that will help future users. Any note from the Murphy lab is an example of this type of updating. For example, later we made a new bacterial construct that used a Kan marker and constitutive promoter instead of an Ara inducible promoter and Carb marker to streamline experiments. This is not a deviation, it is a natural progression of the research in our lab and our practice of continuously improving our assays and updating protocols. It is disingenuous for the authors to present our updates to our protocols as if we have “deviated” from them – in every instance, we gave the authors all of the information that we had available to us at the time. Our suggestions were made genuinely and in good faith, with the assumption that the authors wanted to get the assay working rather than using it to point out changes in our protocol. Moreover, this statement corroborates our assertion that all or most of the data in this paper seem to have been generated using a protocol that differs significantly from our lab’s, as the bulk of their experiments appear to have been done before contacting us: “Incorporating these changes into our procedures did not reliably alter our results.” (no data shown) 9.	“[T]his example of TEI is insufficiently robust for experimental investigation of the mechanisms of multigenerational inheritance” – The authors failed to test the fundamental requirement for transgenerational inheritance, that is, the expression of P11 sRNA by PA14, which only happens on plates at 25°C. Since they cite our subsequent papers where we first identified P11 sRNA as the key to TEI9, then our finding that the Cer1 retrotransposon is also required for P11-mediated TEI10 and then our finding that other Pseudomonas species use a similar small RNA to induce TEI11, they are definitely aware of this fact. Thus, it is not clear to us why they have not attempted to test P11 sRNA levels while searching for conditions that would replicate our findings. As a result, we can never know whether P11 sRNA was produced in any of the conditions that the authors tested in the experiments shown. Together, Hunter and colleagues’ failure to replicate the basic naïve attraction to PA14 over OP50 demonstrated by other labs, their failure to replicate the P0 daf-7 expression published by other labs, and their failure to reliably replicate the P0 and F1 behaviors shown by other labs suggests to us that there are more basic concerns about their bacterial and C. elegans growth conditions, assay conditions, and assay techniques independent of any of the attempts to replicate the findings from our work.

First, I wonder why authors made the more extreme Gly mutations for the binding site removal instead of the more conservative Ala mutations. Because of the special role of Glycine the quality of the input MSA is probably a lot worse for Gly instead of Ala mutations. Second, I think authors should also report RMSD/pLDDT/PAE for the predicted structures itself and not just the ligand. Since AF3 performs the combined objective of structure prediction and docking mutation of the input has consequences for both objectives. It might be that it performs worse for docking because the overall quality of the structure prediction is reduced.

A few thoughts: 1) It would be great to see how this compares to the PhyB-PIF version 2) Blue light should activate PhyB/PhyA, it would be great to see different blue light doses to see how sensitive it is to blue light, not if it is sensitive to blue light. (See ""Multi-chromatic control of mammalian gene expression and signaling"" and ""Multichromatic Control of Signaling Pathways in Mammalian Cells"") 3) I am not sure what biological replicates means. Where three independent experiments done, or just three biological replicates, one experiment?

Prior to this work, changes in the maternal bacterial, archaeal, and fungal microbiomes in body sites other than the vaginal cavity and gut were poorly understood. The authors characterize the oral, urinary, stool, and vaginal microbiomes, and the urinary metabolome of non-pregnant, as well as pre- and postpartum women. They conclude that the microbiome of the oral cavity quickly rebounds after birth, whereas the vaginal microbiome takes longer to return to its pre-pregnancy state. The authors also conclude that the archaeal content of the oral microbiome correlates strongly with pregnancy status. We feel that most of the conclusions put forth in the paper are well supported. However, we have concerns about conclusions involving archaeal microbiome differences, and we have suggestions for changes in data presentation that may improve clarity. Major Comments 1. The authors do not consider possible confounding variables associated with pregnancy status. Hence, correlation of microbiome differences with pregnancy status might not indicate a direct causative effect. For example, diet and hospital visits are likely to differ between the three groups assessed in the study. The authors should discuss the potential for these and other confounding variables, and, if possible, incorporate relevant metadata in their analyses. 2. Figure 1B, Figure 2A and Figure 2B are informative summaries of microbiome content but they do not indicate variability between participants. We suggest including corresponding supplementary figures with equivalent plots for each individual person in each cohort. 3. The authors state that Methanobrevibacter smithii in the oral cavity is almost exclusively observed for pregnant women. This is most clearly indicated by Supplementary Figure 10. However, Figure 2C appears to show Methanobrevibacter smithii as the most abundant Methanobrevibacter species in the oral cavity for all groups, regardless of pregnancy status. The authors should clarify this apparent disparity. 4. The observation that Methanobrevibacter smithii is found in the oral cavity almost exclusively in pregnant women is one of the most striking parts of the paper. Hence, we recommend moving Supplementary Figure 10 into the main figures. 5. The data in Supplementary Figure 10 indicate raw sequence read counts. Given that read counts are a function of total read depth, we recommend including a more thorough analysis of these data, including a statistical test of significance for the differences observed between cohorts. 6. The authors describe “semi-quantitative” and “qualitative” approaches to detect archaeal taxa. The potential weaknesses of these approaches should be discussed in the Results section. The authors should also indicate which method was used for each of the datasets shown in the figure panels. What does “semi-quantitative” mean? And is it possible to draw conclusions from data generated by “semi-quantitative” or “qualitative” approaches? Minor Comments 1. It would be helpful for non-experts to include definitions of some of the jargon used in the main body of the paper, such as Shannon diversity, richness, alpha diversity and beta diversity. 2. The presentation of metabolomic data in Figure 4B would be enhanced by (i) including a table in which the raw numbers are reported, and (ii) flipping the x-axis to provide a more intuitive view (highlights regulation postpartum). 3. The most abundant bacterial genera in each sample type (stool, oral, urine and vaginal samples) are more clearly communicated in Supplemental Figure 3 than in Figure 1B. This is especially true for stool data, where the microbiome composition is quite different from that in the other body sites, meaning that most taxa are reported as “other”. Hence, we suggest using Supplemental Figure 3 in the main body of the text rather than 1B. 4. In Figure 4A, glucose, succinic acid and fumaric acid are decreased in the postpartum state urine compared with pregnant state urine. Glucose is the starting energy molecule for glycolysis, and succinic acid and fumaric acid are intermediates in the TCA cycle.  Can the authors comment on whether their decrease in postpartum women is a function of the catabolic energy status during lactation? 5. It would be helpful to include text that explains the characteristics of each CST grouping to help the reader better understand (i) how the samples were separated into these groups, and (ii) the significance of CST of the different groups. 6. Figure 3B. This representation is confusing, especially since there are lines with a single point on one side and multiple points on the other. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the data representation in the figure legend. 7. We recommend that the authors consider using color palettes that will make it easier for people with color blindness to distinguish between colors. 8. The representation of data in Figure 2C is difficult to follow. Can the authors use the same representation as Figure 2B? 9. Many of the references to supplementary figures are incorrect. Suggestion for a Future Experiment A further experiment may include collection of stool samples postpartum as well to look at multiple time-points postpartum. It would be particularly interesting to include later postpartum samples to observe how long it takes to return to the prepregnancy microbiome in each body site.",2024-06-03T17:49:15,disqus_y9FR6hyg5J,Joseph Wade,10.1101/2023.08.31.555744,The Dynamics of the Female Microbiome: Unveiling Abrupt Changes of Microbial Domains across Body Sites from Preconception to Perinatal Phase,"Charlotte J Neumann, Manuela-Raluca Pausan, Victoria Haid, Eva-Christine Weiss, Vassiliki Kolovetsiou-Kreiner, Bettina Amtmann, Petra Winkler, Alexander Mahnert, Evelyn Jantscher-Krenn, Christine Moissl-Eichinger",2023-09-01

Previous work suggested that TofI/R was the dominant regulator over QsmR in B. glumae quorum sensing. Here, the authors identify independent roles of TofI/R, distinct from QsmR, and suggest a regulatory effect of QsmR on TofI/R. Moreover, the authors conclude that the QsmR variant T50K substantially reduces B. glumae virulence. The conclusions regarding the hierarchy of TofI/R and QsmR are generally well-supported across multiple independent assays, although there are some inconsistencies between the RT-qPCR and the RNA-seq data. The conclusions regarding the importance of the genotype of qsmR rely heavily on control data that are not shown; in the absence of these data, it is impossible to draw a strong conclusion on the contribution of qsmR to virulence. Major Comments 1. There are some inconsistencies between the RT-qPCR and the RNAseq data.  While the RT-qPCR data indicate ~4-5 times higher toxJ transcripts in 411gr-6 vs 336-gr1, the transcriptomic data from Figure 10 show no difference between the two strains.This is similar for toxA, but the difference between the two isn’t as big. Could the authors provide an explanation for these apparent inconsistencies between experiments? It would also be helpful if the authors could indicate in Figure 10 the variability between replicates. 2. In Figure 9, the authors show that introducing qsmR from a virulent strain into an avirulent strain that produces the T50K variant of QsmR restores virulence. But the key control of introducing the variant qsmR is listed as “not shown”. Data for this control are critical to support the authors’ conclusions and should be included in the figure. We also recommend that the authors complement qsmR deletion mutants with qsmR (both T50K and wild-type) to test whether these can restore virulence phenotypes. 3. In Figure 9 A, C, and D, can the authors include a positive control to indicate the extent to which introducing qsmR restores virulence? Minor Comments 1. Why and how were qRT-PCR data normalized to two housekeeping genes? 2. Can the authors include a brief discussion on the subset of virulence genes chosen for the RNA-seq? 3. It would be informative if the avirulent strain could be used as a control in Figure 2. 4. The method used by the authors to quantify disease severity does not appear to be quantitative and could be difficult to reproduce. Could the authors provide a quantitative assay to allow other groups to reproduce these experiments? Additionally, can the authors comment on whether or not samples were blinded before assessing disease severity, given the possibility for unconscious bias? 5. Could the authors clarify their use of statistical significance markers (Figures 2B and 2D). 6. Figure 10B might be better represented as a heatmap. 7. Figure 9B. For those outside the field, it would be helpful to describe in the text the phenotypic differences for infected virulent vs. infected nonvirulent vs. uninfected. 8. It would benefit the reader if there was a final model figure to tie everything together.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.27.568812v1#comment-6472732526,biorxivstage,0,"Windford and collaborators have studied a community-based cohort of aging and dementia of 84 participants (44 females and 40 males) and used flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to analyze naïve and effector-memory T cell populations. The authors showed that CD8+ TEMRA were positively correlated with Neurofilament Light chain (Nf-L) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP). In marked contrast, the authors found no significant difference in CD8+ TEMRA cells based on cognitive scores and no associations between CD8+ TEMRA and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related biomarkers (ADRB). The authors conclude that their findings suggest that the accumulation of CD8+ TEMRA cells in peripheral blood may be a response to neuronal injury (Nf-L) and neuroinflammation (GFAP) during aging or the progression of AD and ADRB. We agree with Windford and collaborators that the accumulation of CD8+ TEMRA cells in peripheral blood may be a response to neuronal injury. However, this response may go into opposite directions, that is, protective vs. harmful. In this respect, the authors did not mention a previous study in a cohort of elderly people differing in their cognitive status and some being diagnosed with Alzheimer disease (Esgalhado et al., Front Immunol. 2020; 10.3389/fimmu.2020.592656). Besides, the authors ignore that our analysis permitted us to distinguish two CD8+ TEMRA populations according to the level of expression of the phosphatase receptor CD45RA: CD8+ TEMRAhigh  and CD8+ TEMRAlow. Importantly, while CD8+ TEMRAhigh were strongly associated with severe cognitive impairment, CD8+ TEMRAlow were associated with non-cognitive impairment (Esgalhado et al., 2020). In other words, analyzing bulk CD8+ TEMRA cells might be a wrong approach, resulting in the disregard of valuable data. Since Windford and collaborators used a gating protocol to study CD8+ TEMRA similar to ours, it would be interesting to analyze CD8+ TEMRAhigh and CD8+ TEMRAlow in their community-based cohort. This may allow a change of paradigm and discriminate between potentially protective and potentially harmful CD8+ TEMRA cells. Elsa M. Cardoso*#, PhD Fernando A.

Thank you for sharing this very interesting article. In this article, you stated that “Molecular mimicry explains portions of the multiple sclerosis auto-antibodyome”. I suggest that you should take the findings of Martins, et al. (2023) [1] into consideration. These authors pointed out that although the amount of antigenic sharing between hosts and both pathogenic and non-pathogenic parasites and bacteria is massive, molecular mimicry by itself is not a sufficient factor to disrupt intact self-tolerance mechanisms. In this context, in my recent paper ( https://www.aimspress.com/a... [2], I provided the missing link between molecular mimicry and the activation of autoimmune responses. I figured out that activation of the purinergic P2X7R expressed on regulatory T cells is potentially required for molecular mimicry to activate autoimmune responses. This occurs only after repeated or high-dose microbe infection and not after a single low-dose infection. I also presented a novel model of immune responses in mammals to foreign antigens, self-antigens and antigens with molecular mimicry.

Breadth information is a key way of determining true positive from false positive hits in metagenomics: almost all false positives are characterized by low breadth of coverage, as in these cases, reads only mapped to a fraction of the reference. The authors should report coverage from KrakenUniq for their analyses; only counts are provided in the supplementary, but coverage values would be more informative for determining whether a microbial genome is present in a sample.

Ethnonyms like Goths, Langobards and Frisians are political terms. They are not biological categories. Terms like ""Wielbark Goths"" (847) are entirely nonsensical. We simply don't know how the people of the Wielbark culture identified or were identified by others. Most likely they had never heard the name Goths and were not called so by outsiders. The name Goths appears only later in an entirely different region. We also don't know of the earlier ""Gutans"" had anything to do with the Wielbark-people or the later historical Goths. If you investigate the remains of a person buried in a cemetary that may have belonged to the Langobards, you still don't know how the individual identified whose DNA you extracted.

In this manuscript Shub and colleagues present MIC, a new tool for the analysis of three-dimensional macromolecular structures obtained using x-ray diffraction or cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM). Given an atomic model featuring water molecules and/or ions, and the corresponding 3D map data, MIC automatically labels each putative water and/or ion location with a guess water or ion identity. Thanks to improvements in cryoEM instrumentation and data analysis, 3D maps can now frequently be obtained at resolutions better than 2.7Å, so that the problem of correctly labeling small map features as either water or ion presents itself more frequently to practictioners, myself included. In that context the availability of a well-characterized, open-source and highly performant classifier of ion/water density features is timely and most welcome. I found the manuscript to be well written, the description of the method and how it was tested clear (though as a non-expert I had trouble following the description of the network architecture and of the feature attribution methodology), and the results convincing. Most questions that arose as I was reading early parts of the manuscript (e.g. regarding the influence of slight errors in modeling of protein atoms on the labeling of ions/water) were answered in later parts. I only have minor feedback & suggestions for the authors and otherwise am supportive of publication. Here's the feedback I have: - lines 47-48: Perhaps... but I wonder if the authors are aware of Ravera et al (Nature, 2022)... and there may be a few other reports I'm unaware of myself... I wonder whether a radial average profile could be used as part of the fingerprint in future versions of MIC to improve the quality of the labeling by the network. Perhaps the authors could comment (in the discussion?) about whether incorporating experimental map features could be possible in future work? - lines 189-190: ""this simple metric showed statistically significant separation between test set predictions that agreed and disagreed with the deposited PBD label"": I found this sentence confusing at first, and still do to an extent. To me the syntax did not convey the meaning of the figure unambiguously. To spell it out: -- My understanding on first reading was: when a site lands near a boundary (i.e. the model is uncertain), the model's prediction tends to disagree with the deposited PDB label. Doesn't that mean that if the user gets a result that is assigned low confidence, they should actually assume that the identity assigned by MIC is wrong? That would seem to be problematic... wouldn't it? -- Having reviewed Fig 2e, I now think the text was a bit confusing. My interpretation of the figure: at low confidence scores, say around 0.5, it's only slighlty more likely than not that there's a disagreement with the PDB; this is more in line with the behavior I would have hoped for... i.e. when there's uncertainty, it's a close call - not necessarily was the wrong label given... - line 213: ""The revised overall test set accuracy following manual annotation is 83.3%"". This is impressive. How will this translate to lower-resolution structures, where there will be more error in atom positions... I am thinking back to the fact that they authors found that fingerprinting worked best when using very fine shells... Perhaps this should be discussed somewhere [I think this is touched on in the paragraph ending line 269] - line 269: Right. That touches on my earlier question. When you get to the ~3Å range, unless you happen to have your coordinating side chains modeled really well, MIC is going to be quite prone to error. [I still think this topic of accuracy as a function of resolution should be returned to in the discussion] - line 432: ""MIC achieves incredible accuracy"". Hah! I think the authors should aim for the readers to actually believe the claimed accuracy, and it is unhelpful to characterize the accuracy as ""incredible"". I found the manuscript credible overall ;) - line 495-498: ""limiting all calculated (...) to be identity agnostic"" - I don't understand this. Might be worth spelling things out for non-specialists like myself - line 512: ""non/prune-fifp"" I think should be ""non-prune/fifp"" - line 513: ""prune-eifp"" I think should be ""prune/eifp"" Alexis Rohou May 2024",2024-05-20T00:22:12,alexisrohou,Alexis Rohou,10.1101/2024.03.18.585639,Metric Ion Classification (MIC): A deep learning tool for assigning ions and waters in cryo-EM and x-ray crystallography structures,"Laura Shub, Wenjin Liu, Georgios Skiniotis, Michael J.

I would recommend that the authors do not replicate the standard adage of how we have to study this beetle because it is a pest that is difficult to control. There are piles of literature on this topic, including two comprehensive compendia by the Forest Service, dedicated to the biology and management of this species. Foresters know very well how to manage forests to avoid outbreaks of the Southern pine beetle. There is a multi-state program for monitoring the population of the species, and predicting its local outbreaks. Case in point - the beetle was pretty much eradicated from the state of Texas, which is presumably why the authors had to use material from Mississippi. Studying genetics in order to ""kill the pest"" seems mistargeted. We know nearly all bark beetle outbreaks are a symptom of excessive stand density, warming climate, or introductions of invasive species, i.e., human-caused. So justifying this great research by the need to control the insects is not very convincing. The many incredible biological features of this insect would make a much more interesting justification.",2024-05-16T13:44:41,jirihulcr,Jiri Hulcr,10.1101/2024.05.08.592785,Genome assembly of the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmerman) reveals the origins of gene content reduction in Dendroctonus,"Megan Copeland, Shelby Landa, Adekola Owoyemi, Michelle M.

Limited Sample Size: In Figure 1A-E, I noticed that only 18 out of the 54 subjects were included in the comparison of biological age versus chronological age in EL subjects. Due to the already limited nature of having a large sample size of centenarians for research studies, it may be more effective to include more participants because having a smaller sample size may limit the generalizability of findings and necessitate caution in applying results to broader populations or conclusions about aging. 2. Including more controls: In Figure 3 where the forward programming of EL-specific iPSCs into cortical neurons was analyzed, I noticed that there was no control of an established cortical neuron cell line. Including this control, would be helpful in comparing the differences and similarities between the differentiated iPSCs and the cortical neurons, and would further help to confirm the pluripotency of the iPSCs created in this experiment. 3. Inclusion of Demographic Information: Including the demographic information of centenarians or the countries from which they come from would be helpful in contextualizing the study and understanding the possible influences on biological age. Considering that factors such as, geographical location, lifestyle habits and access to healthcare can all influence the aging process, including the demographic information of participants may illustrate environmental or genetic factors that may lead to exceptional longevity. Furthermore, having iPSCs from diverse populations may lead to more robust findings in that they would better represent the genetic variation across the globe. 4. Supplemental figures: While the inclusion of the supplemental figures was interesting in seeing the different population of immune cells in centenarians, there was not sufficient information for readers to see how these immune cell populations compared to offspring or their spouses. Having a control of an offsprings’ spouse would help your audience understand how the population of immune cells in centenarians may have lead them to living a longer life, and provide a clearer picture of the role of immune cells in longevity.",2024-05-14T04:54:31,,Erick Nedd,10.1101/2024.03.12.584663,A longevity-specific bank of induced pluripotent stem cells from centenarians and their offspring,"Todd W.

In the Discussion section of your manuscript you write that [REF20] maintained mESCs in 2i-medium and reported faithful emergence of endoderm cells . Given the importance of mESC culture conditions in your analyses and possible future interpretations (at least, re endoderm), I wanted to point out that — following the practice of the lab I was working in at the time — mESCs were not grown in the classic 2i medium (2i in N2B27), but in fact in a 2i in ES+LIF medium (exact recipe in REF20's Materials & Methods > Cell culture). Based on gastruloid end-phenotype alone (of those shown in FigS1), I would guess this atypical mESCs culture medium is most closely matched by your culture condition 3 (and possibly condition 4), and that those conditions (though they were not selected for scRNAseq) are giving rise to endoderm-rich gastruloids.

The authors have designed a FRET-based assay composed of N-terminal mClover3 donor and C-terminal m-Ruby3 acceptor fluorophores separated by a linker containing the Nsp2/3 PLpro cleavage motif to measure the proteolytic activity of PLpro. From DMS data the authors infer PLpro active site mutations ablates activity. Their study also revealed residues required for cleavage of the Nsp2/3 site, identified features of substrate binding pocket and the sequence requirements of the blocking loop. The authors have given explanations for their observations in the Discussion section. Overall, the paper is supported with follow-up enzymology and crystallography experiments of key residues. The major limitation of this study is leaky expression of mutations can mask clinically relevant mutations that can arise due to viral evolution and might have the potential to evade inhibitor treatment. Study of such mutations can provide more information about the potential escape routes open to the virus to evade developing therapeutics. Moreover, incorporation of statistical analysis could strengthen the confidence in inferences drawn from the deep sequencing data and improve the quality of the manuscript. The following points can improve the quality of the manuscript: Major points 1. In Figure 1f, it is unclear that why is the PLpro activity increasing with increase in inhibitor concentration? Perhaps the Y axis is mislabeled as while inhibitor concentration is increasing, PLpro activity should decrease. However, FRET signal would increase (and maybe should be the axis label), since there will be no cleavage. 2. Line 175 – 178 - What does 0 represent in the normalized dataset? What is the rationale used for selecting minimum 10 reads in the unselected library as the read cut-off. 10 reads is pretty low cut-off. From the data, it seems the distribution tails off before cut-off chosen for the s.d.- by eye. 0.3 s.d and 20 as read cut-off might be a  better option to eliminate sequencing artifacts. 3. Line 187-190 – What is the number of reads for the mutants that showed lower activity scores? There is a possibility that due to low read cutoff, these mutants might be lying in the range with low reads in the unselected library. 4.  Line 223-224 – Authors mention they find a good correlation between activity and abundance score. Although this is noticeable from the scatter plot but supporting high-throughput data with statistical parameters like pearson correlation coefficient, a metric that provides comparison between 2 datasets will make this data reporting more quantitative and informative. 5. Line 1340- Figure 3b- What do authors mean by variants with small enough error? Please be precise. 6.  Line 315-319/ Line 1550-1556- Extended data Fig 15c – It is difficult to interpret the inference reported that is based on the data in Extended Fig 15. There is no data reported for Normalized AMC cleavage for Y268W. Interpretation can be more comprehensible by plotting a scatter plot between the Normalized Activity Fitness Scores obtained from DMS data and Normalized AMC cleavage (%). Through this plot, the reader can easily make out the outlier. 7. Line 364-367 – Authors mention “M208W strikingly increases the protein melting temperature by over 5C, indicating a substantial improvement in thermal stability. Increased stability, and thus reduced turnover in cells, may provide a mechanism to explain leaky expression in our cellular assay and increased yield of recombinant protein for E.coli expression.” Since, leaky expression is a different issue, it is confusing why will leaky expression be a plausible reason for increased stability but less activity? 8. Since Extended data Fig 11a shows that variants display substantial amount of leaky expression, how have the authors taken this information into account while inferring results from DMS activity scores, especially since they are quantifying at the RNA level and not at the DNA level? Can the activity scores obtained for the mutants be normalized to leaky expression scores in some way, for example by subtracting the scores obtained from the leaky expression dataset in order to measure the true activity of each mutant? 9. Solvents are known to affect an enzyme’s activity, selectivity and stability. In Figure 5, authors should consider and comment about the role of solvent in understanding the mechanism of Michelis-Menten kinetics of M208 variants using substrates Z-RLRGG-AMC, Ubiquitin-Rhodamine and ISG15-Rhodamine. Minor points 1. Figure numbers need to be reformatted. Figure 3 onwards they are incorrectly labelled. For eg. ‘Fig 3’ is labelled as ‘Fig 1’. 2. Line 426-429 – In Figure 3b, L and R domains of papain should be labelled or highlighted in separate colors for the ease of understanding for the reader. 3. Overall, different DMS datasets obtained from different assays in the paper have different read cut-offs such as 10, 13 and 18. A consistent statistical logic for obtaining different read cut-offs across different DMS datasets will be helpful. Also, increasing the read cut-off might improve the data quality and minimize sequencing artefacts. - Reviewed by Priyanka Bajaj and James Fraser (UCSF)",2024-05-04T01:52:43,disqus_YtOuuM3QDF,priyanka.bajaj3193@gmail.com,10.1101/2024.03.11.584210,"Mutational Profiling of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in human cells reveals requirements for function, structure, and drug escape","Xinyu Wu, Margareta Go, Julie V.
