During passive fixation, ACC pairwise correlations tended to be reduced when baseline firing rate of LC neurons increased. But, when external events drove transient increases in LC activity, ACC pairwise correlations increased. Both relationships covaried with changes in pupil size. Therefore, modulation of coordinated cortical activity might result, at least in part, from ongoing, context-dependent, arousal-related changes in LC activity (- From the author).",2021-12-09T20:59:29,SiddJoshi,Siddhartha Joshi,10.1101/2020.09.26.314831,Context-Dependent Relationships between Locus Coeruleus Firing Patterns and Coordinated Neural Activity in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex,"Siddhartha Joshi, Joshua I.

The authors combined a large-scale comparative phylogenomic approach with biochemical characterization of putative novel phyllobilins to shed light on how the degradation pathway evolved. This manuscript points to the evolution of chlorophyll degradation, in particular the later detoxification steps, having accompanied the green lineage’s transition to land. An extensive list of orthologous genes from a diverse number of species was identified. The manuscript stands out for the wide evolutionary view on the chlorophyll degradation pathway, which is neither an easy nor a common research subject. The in silico approach for phyllobilins identification is quite innovative and will surely give great hints for biomolecules discovery. A comprehensive bioinformatics work has been done to carefully identify and select the genes analyzed in the manuscript and the related phylogenetics figures are outstanding. Although this work is of great interest, we have some comments that could be addressed in the next version. Major comments - We would suggest to tone down the title as it may be that less or no chlorophyll catabolites were detected in mosses, charophytes and chlorophytes due to the smaller number of species analyzed (Fig.5), and some of these clades may have evolved other phyllobilins exporting and modifying proteins. Please discuss these possibilities. - Page 9, line 16: regarding the identification of 15 putatively novel phyllobilins, mass spectrometry data together with in silico produced list of diagnostic ions are presented to support these structures. Would it be possible to provide additional confirmation via a standard (an internal or a synthesized one) or alternatively to state which other molecules these m/z plus profiles could be corresponding to? How likely is it that they correspond to other unrelated compounds? - Page 5, line 11, comment on two species lacking CAO. Are they lacking chlorophyll b? Minor comments - Intro, page 3, line 19, explain why it is unlikely that nitrogen remobilization be a conserved evolutionary trigger. - Page 8, line 15, what is the carbon source used for heterotrophic growth? Line 19, instead of “etc” list all conditions tested. - Page 9, line 24, could you discuss or introduce whether oxidations are spontaneous or enzymatic? - Could you comment in the discussion about the significance of Chl breakdown catabolites in cellular signaling from an evolutionary point of view? - Methods, in the paragraph “Plant material growth and chlorophyll degradation induction”, page 15, lines 1-12: several of the growth conditions are missing e.g. at which temperature S. moellendorfii was growing? At which temperature and humidity was the dark incubation of leaves performed? - In the Sup. Figure 6 B, the structure of phyllobilin 3b is not shown. It could be nice to have that too or to explain why it is not shown. Please, also include the relevant spectra from the remaining identified compounds as supplemental data (assuming that the 4 presented spectra/structures are also of novel compounds). - Maybe we missed it, but where can we find the identifiers of the genes that were used in the gene trees shown Figures 2, 3 and 4? - The Sup.

Criticisms: The structure of the Omicron RBD made using mutations in Pymol cannot be trusted without proper structural data on the omicron RBD, because Omicron contains a high amount of mutations, the mutations cluster in  a very disordered region of the RBD and influence of the glycans is disregarded (See e.g for their importance https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.... The methods used to predict stability generally tend to work better on decreased stability than for gain of function. There is no benchmark against existing biophysical assays (e.g from deep mutational scanning) to show that the used method  (i-mutant3.0) works on the RBD. In addition, the effect of multiple mutations are likely not additive but subject to epistasis. The used predictor is quite old and should be compared with newer approaches. In general, protein docking is unreliable to estimate binding affinity in absolute terms. Especially in this case because the structures used were obtained by simple mutagenesis in PyMol without any equilibration/relaxation. The conclusions are not be trusted without additional experimental or more reliable computational analysis that includes the proper glycan shield of the protein and relaxed structures. It is unclear how a table of amino acid composition and corresponding secondary structure prediction is useful or has any meaning for the conclusions of the article. The fact that the RBD is mainly alpha helical is not an indicator for high structural stability. The differences between the predicted fractions of alpha helices are meaningless and very small.

Apologies if I've missed something in my quick read of the paper, but one concern I have about the interpretation of the findings is that low RF distances might be reflecting a lack of precision (i.e. more nodes collapsed to polytomies) rather than higher accuracy; see Smith 2019, Biol Lett, 10.1098/rsbl.2018.0632 – would this really make a tree ""better""? And I didn't quite follow whether collapsing nodes at random with -R might resolve nodes in a fashion that is not consistent with the original analyses; if so, this could potentially inflate RF distances. Presumably the size of the simulated trees precluded the use of any of the more robust alternatives to the RF distance (e.g. Smith 2020, Bioinformatics, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa614)?",2021-12-06T11:51:44,PalaeoSmith,Martin R.

(1) is an extension of nucleic acid structural studies aimed at targeting pathogens at the genome or transcript level, rather than at the protein level (2, 3). Furthermore, having identified sites of interest, they explore ways of predicting whether an 18-base antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) is likely to be therapeutically effective. This is a promising first step in dealing with a long-neglected disease. While some metric abbreviations (e.g. minimum free energy; MFE) are in general use, a table showing how their abbreviations correspond to historical usages would facilitate comparison with other works. For example, the contribution of base order (rather than base composition) to structure, which is here assessed as the Z-score (1), relates to the ""folding of randomized sequence difference"" (FORS-D) values of one group (2, 3) and the ""genome-scale ordered RNA structure"" (GORS) values of another (4). For controls, the ""Scanfold"" technology includes the controversial shuffling of single bases so destroying base order (rather than of dinucleotides or trinucleotides that would have kept a degree of base order). The authors could point out that, for their purposes, randomizing base order by single base shuffling (5) is now generally accepted. The authors note that the coding region of a gene can appear ""to be unstructured (as evidenced by mediocre MFEs and positive Z-scores)"". This is attributed to factors such as ""to promote rapid translation,"" or ""modulating accessibility to regulatory molecules."" However, it has long been known that, whether genomes are DNA or RNA, the potential for stem-loop structures is a pervasive, genome-wide, property (4), which is likely to facilitate ""kissing-loop"" recombination. A need to encode proteins conflicts with this, especially in genes under positive Darwinian selection (5, 6). Thus, despite synonymous flexibility at third codon positions, there is generally greater structure potential in non-genic genome regions and, for eukaryotes, also in introns (rather than exons that tend to be purine-rich; 7). Finally, for a discovered target site to retain its therapeutic vulnerability, it should be conserved from generation to generation within a species. At present, it appears that there are insufficient M. ulcerans sequences for detailing within-species conservation. The authors rely on inter-species data from other mycobacterial species. While this might facilitate the discovery of general anti-mycobacterial ASOs, they would not be optimized for an individual species. 1. Rouse WB et al.

Here some minor points to consider - you do not mention MIRIAM identifiers. I assume all of your analysis is focused on the subset of `BQB_IS`. This should be clearly stated and also be discussed how the metrics would work or could be extended to handle all of the MIRIAM qualifiers - you mention the large set BiGG annotated models. One issue with the model collection is that many of the models are variants of a single ecoli model with minimal changes. Also all models are build from a common parts repository (the universal model), so that annotations are shared between the models. So despite being a collection of annotated models it is not very representative. In addition the model annotations are created based on a tool ( https://github.com/draeger-... - A comparison between the curated and uncurated models in biomodels would be very informative. An important part of the curation process is the addition of annotation at biomodels. Performing your analysis on the uncurated branch should provide a good estimation of the real annotation coverage/metrics. - Uniprot annotations are important annotations for reactions which allow to encode the catalyzing protein. This information is very important to map protein data on reactions, e.g., in the context of FBA models. These should probably be encoded via the qualifier `BQB_HAS_PART`. This is crucial information and part of many models. - a correlation plot between the metrics could be very interesting. It would be interesting to see color coded scatter plots of different subsets of the models (e.g. model size, domain, metabolism/signalling, year of submission) Best Matthias",2021-12-02T21:31:49,disqus_ZpshIJlLcT,Matthias König,10.1101/2021.10.09.463757,SBMate: A Framework for Evaluating Quality of Annotations in Systems Biology Models,"Woosub Shin, Joseph L.

How did the authors reach the conclusion that the US science education system is better than that of every single other country in the planet? Have these analyses been performed in other countries? Which studies are the authors sourcing from? ""By almost any measure, the U.S. remains the world leader in basic and applied research.

In the same way that the majority of Nobel Prizes have been won by men and this does not mean that men are leaders in the life sciences, the majority of US Nobel winners does not necessary imply that the US is a leader in the life science. Rather, it likely tells more about structural biases in the evaluation of science and in scientific participation and output in the life sciences, and bias in the Nobel attribution process. Similarly, papers in the life science are already heavily skewed towards US representation. Even with equal citation numbers, the majority of  papers within any citation tier would thus also be from the US. The definition of what ""top life science journals"" are is also clearly built on anglophony and US-centric axiologies. The authors seem to see meritocracy in academic aspects that are clearly not acritically so, and that are in fact rife with Matthew effect and US-favourable biases.

The Introduction addresses what is known/inferred regarding the heterogeneity of exocytotic responses in neuroendocrine cells and sets up the framework to investigate what is not known. The authors make a good case at comparing the strengths and limitations of TIRF with conventional fluorophores and amperometric recordings and at how the read outs of both methods are not easy to integrate or reconcile. The regulation of secretion by the fusion pore itself was, until now, assigned to size, behavior as a sieve, and commitment to full fusion versus kiss and run.  The findings reported here by Zhang et al add a layer of complexity by revealing that the duration of the fusion pore is bimodal and regulated rather than stochastic, as previously assumed. In doing so, this paper opens the door to future work on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the bimodal nature of regulated DCV exocytosis. The experiments are elegant and very meticulous, many possible hypotheses and interpretations are offered and justified. Each conclusion is supported by more than one experimental approach and by numerous, rigorous, original controls. Interpretation of the results includes deep insights in addition to the primary description, such insights may or may not have been contemplated when outlining the experiments, but there they are, exquisitely capitalising on the findings. Examples that illustrate this point are: i) slow events derive exclusively from docked vesicles, which means that the state of docking influences subsequent behavior of the pore. ii) Release by newcomers is always fast, which implies that tethering, priming, docking and fusion occur within a few milliseconds of granule arrival at the fusion site. iii) Rapid efflux of luminal cargo through a narrow pore delays external dye entry, and so on and so forth. I can´t wait to see what the authors will do next with the new imaging technique reported here.",2021-12-01T14:42:51,,Claudia Tomes,10.1101/2021.11.01.466835,High-Speed Imaging Reveals the Bimodal Nature of Dense Core Vesicle Exocytosis and Jet Flow through the Fusion Pore,"Pengcheng Zhang, David Rumschitzki, Robert H.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.08.443256v2#comment-5622056706,biorxivstage,0,"This manuscript investigates how Gq signaling regulates egg-laying behavior in C. elegans by determining the relative contributions and sites of action of the two main branches of Gq signaling, PLCbeta and Trio RhoGEF. Mutants in PLCbeta and Trio RhoGEF are examined for steady-state egg-retention, vulval muscle calcium transients, and egg-laying in response to serotonin, optogenetic stimulation of the HSN motor neurons, or phorbol esters. Experiments are solid and performed rigorously, with appropriate sample sizes, statistics, and data presentation. The major conclusions are that PLCbeta acts exclusively in neurons, that Trio acts in both neurons and muscles, and that both pathways promote egg-laying by production of the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG). Finally, it is concluded that DAG promotes egg-laying independently of the known DAG effectors UNC-13 and PKC. There is strong support for the conclusions that PLCbeta acts in neurons and that Trio RhoGEF has a major role in the vulval muscles. Support for other conclusions is somewhat weaker, and it would be good to provide stronger evidence or to tone down the conclusions. The title of the paper should also be changed accordingly. Major points: 1. The conclusion that both PLCbeta and Trio RhoGEF pathways promote egg-laying by production of DAG is based on the clear rescue of these mutants by the phorbol ester PMA, a DAG-mimetic. However, it is possible that PMA is a dirty drug and has other non-DAG related targets, a possibility supported by the fact that loss of known DAG targets does not block the effect of PMA. Thus, these caveats should be discussed and this conclusion should be toned down. 2. It is concluded that DAG promotes egg-laying independently of known DAG targets UNC-13 and PKC. This conclusion is based on the fact that the phorbol ester PMA still stimulates egg-laying in single mutants of unc-13 or individual PKC genes. In addition to the possibility that PMA acts via a DAG-independent mechanism (see point 1 above),  there are other caveats to this interpretation. There are multiple PKC genes that may be redundant or PMA may act via both UNC-13 and PKC genes (unc-13; pkc double mutants were not tested). Thus, these caveats should be discussed and this conclusion should be toned down. 3. The conclusion that unc-73/Trio RhoGEF acts in neurons in addition to muscle is based only on the quite weak rescue of the unc-73 mutant steady-state egg-laying defect by pan-neuronal expression of unc-73  (Figure 1K). One concern is that the unc-73 mutant (the control) had a considerably stronger defect in this experiment than in other data presented in the paper (Fig. 1I), raising the possibility that the weak rescue is just intrinsic variability in the behavior. Also, given that this rescue involves overexpression from a multicopy array, it is possible that there is leaky expression in other tissues such as muscle which would confound the interpretation. It is also implied that there is stronger rescue by coexpression of unc-73 in neurons and muscle than in muscle alone (Fig. 1K), but these two groups are not compared for statistical significance. Without stronger evidence that unc-73 acts in neurons, the conclusion should be toned down. 4. It is unclear why the egg-laying defect of egl-8/PLCbeta mutants is rescued by optogenetic stimulation of HSN neurons but not by serotonin – this is an interesting but weird result. A model is proposed (lines 488-506 in the Discussion), but it is quite confusing and hard to follow – a model figure might help. It seems that the authors propose that PLCbeta may act outside of the HSNs to promote egg-laying, perhaps in the VC neurons. However, it has not been demonstrated that pan-neuronal rescue of egl-8 is able to rescue its serotonin-resistant phenotype and that muscle-specific expression fails to rescue, which are important experiments to conclude that egl-8/PLCbeta is indeed acting in neurons. It would also be interesting to see what happens with HSN and VC-specific rescue. 5. Related to point 4 above, in several places it is stated that PLCbeta and Trio RhoGEF act presynaptically (lines 84, 485-487). Given that it is unclear which specific neurons these pathways act in, it is unclear whether they are indeed “presynaptic.” We suggest avoiding the terms “presynaptic” and “postsynaptic” and instead say “neuron” and “muscle.” Minor points: 1. In Fig 1J, it appears that pan-neuronal rescue of egl-8/PLCbeta actually causes hyperactive egg-laying. It is unclear whether this is due to overexpression or possible ectopic expression, which would have caveats for inferring a neuronal site of action of endogenous egl-8/PLCbeta based on the use of this transgene. 2. line 337-338: In data presented in this paper, an egl-8(sa47) mutant is reported to be resistant to serotonin, whereas it was previously reported to be sensitive (Bastiani et al. 2003). It is suggested that the discrepancy may be due to different levels of serotonin. However, given that the previous paper used a lower concentration of serotonin (7.5 mM instead of 18.5 mM), this explanation does not make sense. Additionally, Bastiani et al. reported that an unc-13(e51) mutant laid eggs in response to serotonin, again inconsistent with the results of the current paper where unc-13 is shown to be resistant. This discrepancy should also be pointed out, even if it cannot be explained. The previous paper also examined a third allele of egl-8, md1971, and found it to be sensitive to serotonin. A reexamination of that mutant would also be useful. 3. line 508: it is stated that Trio RhoGEF acts in motor neurons to control locomotion behavior. However, Hu et al. 2011 only showed rescue of unc-73/Trio RhoGEF mutants by expression in widely expressed neuronal promoters (unc-119 or egl-3 promoters), and did not observe rescue by motor-neuron specific promoters (unc-17 and unc-47 promoters). 4. For the calcium imaging experiments in Figures  4 & 5, it is unclear how frequency of calcium transients is measured. Is this the frequency of transients during the entire recording or only during active egg-laying states? If it is during the entire recording, how to control for different numbers of active states from animal to animal? In the trace shown in Fig 4A, a dgk-1 mutant appears to have a higher frequency of transients than wild-type outside the active state as well as an increased amplitude of egg-laying transients – is this trace not representative? 5. Two pkc-1 mutants were stimulated by PMA but one wasn’t (Fig 6D). This discrepancy is not discussed. 6. line 312: It is stated that rescue of unc-73 by expression from a muscle-specific promoter is greater than from a neuron-specific promoter. Though this appears to be true in the data presented, this conclusion is based on comparing rescue by different transgenes; given that there is often variability in rescue even by different transgenes of the same construct, this is a tricky comparison to make. All of these rescue lines are overexpressed and could be overexpressed to different levels or with different amounts of mosaicism, either of which could affect the level of rescue. 7. line 464: “To determine whether serotonin promotes egg laying through Protein Kinase C…” – however, the following experiment does not actually test pkc mutants for their serotonin response. 8. line 284: it is stated that wild-type worm retain 12 eggs, yet in Fig 1C, it says 15. In line 330, it states that 70% of HSN-deficient worms laid eggs in response to serotonin, but the data in Fig 2B shows slightly under 60%. 9. typos: line 367 – should be egl-8(n488); line 430 – should be Fig. 5B.

This, like the 2001 second edition (1), was published by the University of Chicago Press. In both editions, Provine defers to Mark Adams (1968) ""for an account of the Russian school's"" contributions (2). However, important post-1971 works of these biohistorians (3) may have been overlooked. In my previous comment, I noted Adams' reinterpretations that appeared around 1990. To draw attention likewise to Provine, I recommend that Johri et al. cite his second edition, not the first edition. There, Provine provides an ""afterword"" that goes far beyond the diffident reservations that concluded his 1971 edition. Whereas the strong influence of his University of Chicago mentor, Richard Lewontin, is acknowledged for the first edition, Provine's mature and independent viewpoint emerges in the second. Readers should be aware of it. For Adams the deemed enlightenment was an ""epiphany,"" but for Provine it was slower. In 2001 Provine (1) wrote: ""The evolutionary synthesis came unraveled for me during the period since 1980. Historically, my examination of this period … showed that it was not a synthesis, but rather a systematic diminution of the factors in evolution, and I now call it the 'evolutionary constriction' …. The unity of evolutionary biology inherent in the 'synthesis' has been replaced by a much more interesting and fascinating complex of different levels marching to different drummers. … In 1970 I could see the origins of theoretical population genetics as being an unalloyed good for evolutionary biology …. Now I see these same theoretical models of the early 1930s, still widely used today, as an impediment to understanding.” To remedy, Provine (1) recommended the works of various authors (e.g. Nils Roll-Hansen's translations of Wilhelm Johannsen) and concluded with Chapter 7 of his own masterpiece (3). This featured the nineteenth century peripatric speciation (today, founder principle) studies of John Gulick, and the non-geographical reproductive isolation studies (today, biological species concept) of Darwin's young research associate, George Romanes (4). 1.

The authors performed a partial 13C labeling assay and identified 74 proteins with significant turnover rate changes in high light compared to standard light. Then they compared the transcriptional level and protein abundance of those 74 proteins and found negligible correlation between them, but a strong correlation between the turnover rate of the proteins encoded by nuclear genes and their transcripts. This study significantly advances the field of stress responses in plant biology with the findings of new direct or indirect targets of photodamage and how transcriptional processes counteract protein degradation to maintain proteostasis under high light. Major comments -	Please provide qPCR data to verify the RNA-seq results on representative genes showing significant changes e.g. RH2A2A, FTSH8, PARG2, BCS1, PUB54 in Fig 2C. For Fig 2A, a Venn diagram or an intersection analysis would be more informative. -	Please describe in more detail how the LPF and especially PTO values were calculated based on the 13CO2 labeling experiment in the method. -	Please explain the lack of change in D1 accumulation in Fig 5B and provide D1 immunoblot for each time point. Also indicate the meaning of NA in the legend. -	In Fig 3, clarify the reasoning behind using the same peptide for THI1 and PIFI to calculate LPF in the two light conditions but different peptides for PSBA. Please provide an explanation in the text for calculating LPF using 2h HL for PSBA, 5h for THI1 and 8h for PIFI. What about the LPF from the same protein, such as PSBA, at different time points? Please provide an explanation of the absence of time points for PSBA, THI and PIFI. -	Line 209, please add a sentence to explain that you are assuming that the translation rates are similar for all the detectable proteins in your manuscript. Indeed if the translation rate is different in HL compared to normal light for a given protein, then this will affect its labeling and thus estimation of the degradation rate. -	Line 128-131, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are not abundant throughout high light treatment, and especially at 8h high light, they are back to the level in standard light. Rewrite these sentences to better reflect the results. -	Line 168, comment on down-regulated proteolytic pathways in cytosol. -	Abstract about plastid-encoded proteins, it should be noted that the distinction is made based on four observed proteins, do you think a generalization can be made for other plastid-encoded proteins? Minor comments -	Fig 1, A, B, C, D, the Y-axis and ticks on the axes should be added for more readability; A,B, add x-axis legend D, Y-axis should start at 0. -	Line 118, do you mean that heat can induce NPQ by “contribute”? Please provide a reference and the leaf surface temperature measurements. -	In Fig2 C, define pink color for p-values. -	In Fig 3, it is difficult to distinguish the light green and dark green in the histogram. We suggest changing the color for the natural abundance (NA) or the newly synthesized peptides, label the x-axis and to use another acronym for ""natural abundance"". -	Line 211, ""one-third to one-half"". Three LPF are presented in standard light conditions, the lowest being 28.5% and the highest 41.2%, that’s not “one-half” or does this refer to other proteins with LPF of 50%? In that case, data is not presented. Clarify or include the data in Table S4. -	Line 216, how is the KD value calculated? -	Line 235, it is difficult to identify PSBP in Fig 4. Please make it clearer. -	Please show your protein Coomassie Blue staining results from the in-gel digestion for MS as a supplementary figure to see the amount of total proteins compared to explain the variation shown in Fig S2A. -	Throughout text, make sure when you say ""high light"" to specify which time point (2h, 5h or 8h?). -	Line 301-303, ferredoxin thioredoxin reductase also showed a significant abundance decrease after 8 hours. Please comment this in the text. -	Line 344-347, the lower Fv/Fm level after longer high light exposure is not only due to the uncoupling of D1 degradation from its synthesis rate but also due to sustained NPQ forms such as qI (see Malnoë EEB 2018, doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.05.005). -	RNA-seq method: which fold-change threshold was selected to consider the candidates?  How many technical replicates were used? -	Line 352, you state that protein degradation is supported by up-regulation of protease gene expression, but what about their degradation rates? In Chlamydomonas, FtsH transcript is upregulated in high light but its rate of degradation is also faster resulting in a modest higher accumulation of the FtsH protease (see Wang et al. Mol Plant 2017, doi: 10.1016/j.molp.2016.09.012). -	Line 374, you state that translation failed to keep pace with protein degradation, you could cite work on chloroplastic translation rate being affected by oxidation of translation factors in cyanobacteria (see Jimbo et al.

Just wanted to comment on the following statement: “Photosystems, however, are complicated, specific structures with a relatively limited capacity for functional variability or spectral tunability.” All photosystems have a common origin. And from that origin you have the emergence of a photosystem that can split water to oxygen generating over one volt of oxidative power, reducing quinones. On the other hand, you have a second photosystem that evolved to generate over -1 volt of reductive power to reduce ferredoxins and at a potential that allows the fixing of carbon dioxide, both spectrally tuned to a level of precision that still blows the mind of scientists. These can be “spectrally tuned” to do the same function as efficiently using far-red red light, shifted about 40nm beyond the standard PAR, in what’s known as the FaRLiP, widespread in cyanobacteria. You have the evolution of the spectrally tuned photosystems of the Prochlorococcus optimized to work with just blue light. From the same origin, you have the anoxygenic photosystems that have been spectrally tuned to use infrared light all the way from 800 to 1000 nm. They all have evolved to use different type of pigments and cofactors as it is characteristic of each phyla or group. Within cyanobacteria, you have other mechanisms of tunability and adaptability that allows the photosystem to be dynamically optimized to changing functions. So, for example, a cyanobacteria may carry encoded in their genomes a set of subunits that can be replaced to optimize the photosystem to low light, or high light, or low oxygen, and even far-red light. In fact, Photosystem II can be changed from water oxidation to chlorophyll-f synthesis. A single cyanobacteria strain, like Chroococcidiopsis or Nostoc can encode in their genomes the capacity to assemble over a dozen of differently of optimized photosystems II and photosystem I. Some of these photosystem II versions may have functions beyond water oxidation. The vast majority of these variant forms have not even been characterized yet. So, what you say in the statement, is not really accurate… and in comparison with rhodopsins, it may be the exact opposite. I could argue that the functional variability and spectral tunability of rhodopsins pale in comparison with what photosystems can actually do... but a single pigment can only take you so far! :D Think about it ;) Again, thank you for the fascinating work!

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.21.464743v1#comment-5614275285,biorxivstage,2,"We (the Bacterial Pathogenesis and Physiology Journal Club at the University of Alabama at Birmingham) read this manuscript this week with great interest. Our compiled comments are listed below. We hope the authors will find them helpful. Introduction 1) The authors make the claim that “While several hundred ISGs with various known functions have been identified, IFN has primarily been studied in its role in orchestrating anti-viral immunity. The role of IFN signaling in response to bacterial products, and how this may influence immune homeostasis in particular, is poorly understood.” There is a great deal of literature about the role of IFN signaling in non-viral responses, including bacteria (some of which the authors then go on to discuss). Several reviews in the recent years have collected this data in a way that gives a more complete understanding, including Gutierrez et al who seem to have published data in 2020 describing a mechanistic pathway by which beneficial bacteria activate Type I IFN signalling [1-4]. Perhaps the authors had a specific instance in mind (such as a mechanism, a specific type of response, or specific T-reg response), but in saying the role of IFN signaling in response to bacterial products is poorly understood in general dismisses a great body of work in the field. 2) The use of “tonic signaling” “tonic IFN expression”, and “basal IFN expression” is a little confusing. Consider clarifying what is meant by “tonic” and whether it is different from “basal” expression of IFN. 3) The final sentence in the authors’ introduction seems to be reversed, in that their data suggests that commensal microbiota promotes intestinal homeostasis via type I IFN signaling, whereas they say that type I IFN signaling promotes homeostasis via commensal microbiota. Results 1) The authors discuss the expression of IfnB and Mx1 in their germ-free/monocolonized/specific pathogen-free experiment. Why is Mx1 important? What is it? Later on the authors identify it as an IFN-induced gene, but best practice would be to do so as part of the rational behind the experiment, rather then waiting until later to explain its significance. 2) Sample size irregularity and lack of error bars makes Figure 1A difficult to believe. 3) The “specific pathogen-free” mouse description is questionable for several reasons. Firstly, what pathogen is lacking? This is not addressed in the paper. Secondly, how were these mice developed? Were they developed by colonizing germ-free mice with a cocktail of microbes minus a specific one? Germ-free mice have many issues with immunological development that may skew or complicate the data, including issues in innate and adaptive immune cell development. In the methods the authors say they were ordered from Jacksons Laboratory, but there is no stock number given for these mice and a basic search does not return results that are “specific pathogen-free”. 4) In Figure 1A, there is no unmanipulated positive control (ideally a non-germ free WT mouse) for comparison. While the Specific Pathogen Free samples are a good indicator, they are still a manipulated strain. The authors would benefit from having a non-germ free WT mouse line as a control, especially considering the immunological developmental issues in a germfree mouse. 5) For Figure 1B, the Y axis is labeled mIFNb (pg/ml). For consistency with Figure 2B, the axis should be labeled “IFN? (pg/mL)”. 6) In Figure 1C there is no description of how the authors ensured only CD11c+ cells were being screened from the lamina propria tissue isolation. There is no described enrichment step in the paper, nor an isolation method. Additionally, the methods do not list a CD11c antibody in the flow cytometry list, which makes it difficult to interpret if the flow cytometry results of the pSTAT1 expression is gated off a CD11c+ population, a different population (such as CD4+ T cells), or total cells. 7) For Figure 2, the authors title the figure “B. fragilis induces IFN? expression in dendritic cells to coordinate Treg response”, but nothing in the figure discusses CD4+ cells, let alone Tregs. This figure specifically demonstrates that culturing with B. fragilis induces IFN? expression and downstream STAT1 phosphorylation in dendritic cells. While this may be involved in Treg development/activation, the data presented in no way demonstrates a direct connection between B. fragilis and Treg responses. Later on, the authors demonstrate this result, but in this figure the data does not support the claim made by the title. 8) From Figure 3 on, the authors no longer use the GF cells in their experiments, which is a disappointment, as they had such a district deficit in type I IFN signaling. Using the IFNAR-/- mice accomplish the effect of preventing type I IFN signaling but doing the same experiments using BMDCs from GF mice with and without a B. fragilis pulse would be interesting and would perhaps strengthen the argument that the commensal bacteria are important in both priming and driving type I IFN signaling. 9) For figure 3A, the axis is confusing, as the total population is not clear – is it 10% of all cells in the well are CD4+, Foxp3, and IL10 positive? Is it 10% of all CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells are IL-10+? If the axis was renamed to be more in-line with the text, that would help clear up the message of the figure. The text indicates that you are discussing the % of Tregs that are producing IL-10, which seems most reasonable, but the current axis could suggest that it’s 10% of all cells in the culture, and the figure legend suggests that the y axis represents the % of CD4 T cells in the culture that are Foxp3+ IL-10+. 10) For Figure 3C, it seems as though this should be a figure by itself that comes before Figure 3, or at the very least be Figure 3B, because the claim of Figure 3 is demonstrated in the current Figure 3B, which shows that IFNAR signaling in BMDCs is required for IL-10 production in Tregs. The current figure 3C shows the effect of losing IFNAR signaling in DCs alone, and should therefore go before the effect of this loss in DCs on Tregs. By changing the arrangement of figures the story flows more cleanly: B. fragilis treatment of DCs drastically increases their ability to trigger IL-10 production in Treg cultures > Loss of IFNAR signaling in BMDCs drastically affects the expression of many IFN-regulated genes and eliminates the effect of B. fragilis treatment > The loss of IFNAR signaling also impairs the ability of DCs to trigger IL10 production in Tregs, regardless of B. fragilis treatment. Conclusion: B. fragilis primes DCs to trigger IL-10 production in Tregs in an IFNAR-dependent manner. 11) Also for Figure 3 in its entirety, the DCs used in this experiment (according to the methods) are IFNAR1-/-, while in the text and in the figure they are listed as “IFNAR-/-“. They still have IFNAR2 and this should be noted. 12) For Figure 4B, a more detailed explanation of how the authors developed this analysis and what it is intending to show needs to be provided. There is next to no explanation of this particular result, only what the authors take it to mean. There’s no explanation of what the parameters of tSNE1 and tSNE2 are, or why the MLN seems to have a cluster of BF cells in the lower left region while the cLP has them disbursed. Indeed, the text suggests that both the MSN and cLP have BF cells clustered, but the cLP plot shows a disbursement of these cells in all the regions… In all this is a confusing figure that doesn’t really add anything to the paper without clarification as to what it is supposed to be showing. 13) For Figure 4C, the genes need to be listed in the same order for effective comparison between the two tissues. At a glance, it appears that MLN and cLP cells have a highly similar expression pattern… however, the genes are not the same in these two datasets. BP treated MLN cells have Oas2 as the most upregulated gene while BP treated cLP cells have Ifit3 as the most upregulated gene. Looking at the figure as is now would suggest that the two populations are fairly similar, but in reality there are several genes that are differentially expressed between. 14) Also in Figure 4C, the gene set offered is a very small subset of the type I interferon responding gene family. While a small set of this subset are differentially expressed, what is the significance overall? This dataset needs more gene expression data to show a more complete picture and justify the claim that bacterial colonization induces type I IFN signatures in intestinal Tregs. Overarching Comments 1) The general conclusion of this paper is that type I IFN signaling in DCs, induced by commensal bacteria, is essential for Treg activation: a. From the summary: “Bacteroides fragilis induced type I IFN response in dendritic cells (DCs) and this pathway is necessary for the induction of IL-10-producing Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs).” b. From the Introduction: “Notably, B. fragilis induced IFN? and type I IFN signaling in dendritic cells (DCs) are required for commensal induced Foxp3+ Treg responses” c. From the Results: “Thus, type I IFN signaling in DCs is critical for commensal bacteria to direct Treg responses, even when IFN signaling is intact in T cells.” However, Figure 3B shows that while it is important for activation, these T cells are still activated and IL-10 production is still triggered at substantially higher levels over the untreated controls. Essential would suggest that the inability to perform this signaling would completely inhibit the DCs’ ability to trigger IL-10 production, or at the very least bring the expression level of IL-10 down closer to untreated controls. 2) This paper represents a good first pass of the data, but the authors need to reevaluate the extent of their claims. There are several experiments that need to be either repeated with higher sample sizes (Figure 1A for example) or re-evaluated for a less broad interpretation (Figure 3B). 3) Figure colors should be reworked to make the differences more distinct. In Figure 1, for example, it is difficult to tell that the Bf samples are blue while the SPF samples are black. The RNA-seq data colors make it difficult to compare differences in expression in the middle of the spectrum (Yellow is different from blue, but blue-green is difficult to detect from green-blue). 4) In general, the authors show convincing data for commensal bacteria playing a role in this type I IFN – DC – Treg process. However, there are two major issues with the authors’ interpretations. The first is that they only show priming with commensal bacteria is necessary for these effects – maintenance is not discussed. Secondly, the use of words like “essential”, “necessary”, “inhibit”, and “required” are not appropriate in many conclusions, such as the title of Figure 3. While the lack of IFNAR1 signaling impairs IL-10 production, it does not inhibit it. There is a reduction but not a loss of function. Summary Response: The authors make a good effort in unraveling a complicated mechanism of commensal microbes’ effects on host immunity. The authors present a good deal of convincing data that show that commensal bacteria effect the ability of dendritic cells to trigger Treg IL10 expression. A more rigorous investigation into the mechanism of this phenotype is warranted, however, as the data does not show this activity to be essential the Treg activation. From the data presented, the authors are safe in arguing that commensal bacteria like B. fragilis prime dendritic cells, making them more sensitive to type I interferon signaling and more capable of inducing type I interferon signaling in a manner that more effectively drives Treg activation (as measured by IL10 production).

Bunyavirus proteins need to interact with the host cell in order to get access to the translation machinery, transport systems etc. The L protein contains the viral polymerase and is thus central to the viral replication cycle. Together with viral RNA and the nucleoprotein NP it constitutes the viral ribonucleoparticles, which are the structural and functional units for genome replication and transcription. So far only nucleoprotein and Z protein interactomes have been reported. The authors address this gap by inserting a biotin ligase internally into the L protein, a position previously reported by Vogel and Rosenthal et al. 2019 (PMID: 30926610), and biotinylating all proteins in proximity to the L protein in a mini-replicon experiment, which recapitulates the steps of viral genome replication and transcription. The authors complement this dataset by silencing experiments using siRNAs. One of the proviral factors identified, GSPT1 – eucaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a – was further validated by co-immunioprecipitation, co-localization and mini-replicon experiments as well as in infection experiments. This study will be of high interest for the scientific community and suggests GSPT1 as a potential drug target against Lassa virus infection. We have a few comments on the manuscript we hope the authors find useful and might want to consider: 1. We would appreciate mentioning, if in the constructs linkers have been used before or after the tags and which sequence those linkers would have. 2. In Figure 1B the authors used the term “polymerase activity” to label the y-axis while in Figure 5B its “minigenome activity”. If it’s the same assay and the same readout the terms should be consistent. 3. In line 135 the authors describe a slightly lower expression level of L-407-HA-TurboID. However, Figure 1B shows at least less than 50% expression level which is significantly lower. Was the detection of L performed with the same samples as the minigenome readout? If yes, the authors might want to discuss this discrepancy between expression and measured activity. 4. Only a small fraction of NP was biotinylated. The conclusion from the authors is that this “may reflect that only a low percentage of the total NP participates in the formation of a functional vRNP, or that in the vRNP, the majority of NP was not accessible to biotinylation or remained insoluble under the lysis conditions we used to prepare the proteomic samples”. This could easily be tested with Western blot analysis of the insoluble fraction after cell lysis. 5. In Fig. 2c it is not clear which factors occurred in more than one screen. A supplementary figure in which the hits in Fig. 2c are labeled (+ zoom into graph) would help to understand which of the hits are highly enriched. 6. Why haven’t the authors used a control in which TurboID-HA was transfected separately from the tagged L protein in the minigenome assay? 7. In the abstract and text 6  factors that influenced LASV infection are mentioned but in the figure 3C & S2B there are actually 7 factors labeled with “siRNAs significantly affected infection across two experiments” 8. In the two figures 3 and S2 (siRNA screen experiment, one for MOI 0.5 and one for MOI 1) it is unclear if for both MOIs biological repeats have been performed or if these were single experiments (in technical triplicates) that were analyzed together (MOI 0.5 and 1). It’s also not clear if the infection rate was similar for both MOIs. The authors might want to discuss the differences between the MOI 0.5 and MOI 1. 9. In the two figures 3 and S2 it is unclear why some dots have a white outline and other don’t. In Fig. S2 the upper UPF1 bubble is not completely with color. 10. For the siRNA experiments, LAMP1 and DDX3X knock-down as controls were only tested or displayed for MOI 1 (Fig S2) and not discussed at all. How do the authors explain that these siRNAs didn’t show any effect? DDX3 showed an effect in LCMV siRNA knockdown studies and effects upon knock-out for LASV and LCMV (PMID: 30001425). Although LAMP1 is described as an entry factor, Lassa pseudovirus infection studies with LAMP1 knock-down (approx. 15% remaining expression) showed no differences compared to wildtype cells (PMID: 29295909). The authors might want to discuss their results regarding LAMP1 and DDX3X. 11. The authors should confirm knock-down of their 6 or 7 hits via Western blotting. 12. In figure S2 the caption lists “C” instead of “B”. 13. The authors might want to compare their results also to the LASV NP interactome dataset available (PMID: 30001425). It seems strange that they compare to the LCMV NP interactome dataset but not to the LASV one. In Addition, also the LASV Z AP-MS dataset could be used for comparison since it is known that L and Z interact (PMIDs: 34226547, 34697302, and https://doi.org/10.1038/s41... and although in the replicon system Z is of course not present it would have been interesting to have a look at possible commonalities. 14. In the validation experiments for GSTP1 via CoIP (Figure 5) the “Input” amount of L-HA differs strongly between the different samples. Problematic here is that the input for the control transfection without FLAG-GSPT1 shows a lower expression of L compared to the conditions with FLAG-GSPT1 and after FLAG-IP there is also IP of L detected in absence of FLAG-GSPT1. Like this it is hard to reliably conclude anything from these blots. The Co-IPs could be also repeated via pull-down of LASV L-HA. 15. As the bands in the blots of Figure 6c are quite smeary, the knock-down effect of GSPT1 compared to NSC is not clearly visible. Therefore, it is hard to conclude that the inhibitory effect is due to the GSPT1 knock-down if the knock-down isn’t confirmed. Similarly, the smear for LASV GP2 makes it hard to compare the GP2 levels. Therefore, to conclusion that GP2 levels have decreased 72 h.p.i. (lines 231-236) is not convincing. Since the authors have a functional NP antibody for Western blot, the blots from Fig 6c could be repeated additionally detecting NP. This would also help investigate if the effect the authors seem to observe is limited to the secreted GP or also valid for cytoplasmic proteins such as NP. 16. For the inhibitor studies in figure 6G, the actin control bands are also less intense in presence of the inhibitor, this makes conclusions about the specific targeting of GSTP1 difficult. This should be discussed. Also, (G) is not mentioned in the respective caption, instead (D) is listed twice. 17. In their hypothetical models the authors refer to NP as the cap-binding protein despite the fact that the respective reference (PMID: 21085117) fails to provide any hard evidence for a cap-binding function of LASV NP and other groups could not confirm a role of the proposed cap-binding residues during viral transcription (PMID: 21917929). 18. Since L, NP and the viral genome are sufficient for viral genome replication, transcription and viral protein translation – viral protein translation can’t depend on the eIF4E-Z interaction the authors propose in Fig S5. Also, the authors didn’t mention the role of L- eiF3CL interaction in any of their model. Written by Silke Olschewski and Maria Rosenthal",2021-11-18T19:04:36,,S. Olschewski and M.

The paper is generally easy to read, appears technically sound and provides relatively clear results that will be of interest both to theoreticians and practitioners of cryo-EM. Over the last 10 years cryo-EM has delivered increasingly high-resolution structures that in some cases now rival those of e.g. X-ray crystallography. In addition to examining the structures of macromolecules, cryo-EM may also provide more detailed insights into their energy landscapes because it in principle is a single-molecule technique that enables the visualization of the conformational distribution of molecules. These advances leave two questions that have been difficult to answer. First, to what extent does the “average” structure under cryogenic conditions reflect the ambient temperature “average” structure [realizing that the term average here is somewhat misleading, the authors will understand what is meant]. Second, to what extent does the distribution of conformations (conformational ensemble) present in the cryo-EM sample reflect the distribution at ambient temperatures [leaving aside the technical difficulties of determining structural models of these ensembles from experiments]. While the first question can to a certain extent be answered by comparing structures solved at cryo-conditions with those at ambient temperature (by crystallography), the second question lies at the heart of the utility (and large potential) for cryo-EM to study conformational ensembles. This study provides welcomed data in an area that has been lacking detailed and quantitative modelling, and where experiments are difficult. The results are promising in the sense that they support the idea that cryo-EM can to a large extent capture conformational ensembles at ambient temperatures. Importantly, the study provides a framework to think about these problems in a more quantitative manner that will hopefully spur additional experiments and analyses. Specific comments: Major p. 4: I must admit that I found the RMSF-based analysis somewhat difficult to follow in places. First, just to be sure could the authors confirm that in each case the RMSF is calculated “locally” that is using an average over the specific simulation as reference. Second, when I look at Fig. S1 it appears that there are still some changes in the RMSF curves even towards the end of the simulations that are of the same magnitude (but in the opposite direction) as those observed during cooling. Is that correct or am I looking at the figure in the wrong way? Also, while I realize that it is difficult to boil down a complex ensemble to one or a few numbers that can be tracked, it would be useful with alternative ways of looking at the ensembles. Are there local differences that are not captured by RMSF? What about rotamer distributions. I will leave it up to the authors whether to explore these issues further in this paper. p. 11: In terms of future experimental studies, what kinds of tests of the models could the authors envision? For example, the authors discuss work by Chen et al (Ref 24) on differences depending on the starting conditions. Do the authors’ analytical model capture such effects? Do the authors’ results lead to specific criteria for selecting good model systems to test the effects of cooling on conformational ensembles? p. 11/12: Maybe the authors could also briefly discuss the relationship to other techniques that rely on (rapid) cooling including ssNMR and EPR. I realize that the cooling process is different, but it might still be worth speculating on how the approaches and models the authors present could be extended to other situations. In this context I’d also like to point out relevant work from Rob Tycko studying protein folding by ssNMR with rapid injection into a cold isopentane bath ( https://dx.doi.org/10.1021%.... Minor p. 1/2: In the discussion of molecules settling into the lowest free energy minima at slow cooling rates, it might be worth making it clear that these minima may well be different from the minima at ambient temperatures. p. 4: In the T-quenching MD simulations I couldn’t easily find whether the simulations were performed using pressure control and if so how. p. 6: “the atoms are subjected to harmonic potentials with a force constant c which are uniformly distributed in an interval from −d to d” makes it sound like it is the force constants that are between -d and d. Consider rephrasing. p. 6 “Model3 is a combination of model2 and model3,” should be, I guess, “Model3 is a combination of model1 and model2,” p. 6: It is not clear what value of the pre-exponential factor that the authors use. I did not go through the maths, but I would assume that the choice would affect the “effective” barrier heights e.g. in Fig. 4. It would be useful if the authors would clarify this, given that there has/is some discussion about what pre-exponential factors are relevant for conformational changes in biomolecules. p. 11: The authors write “Biomolecules can thermodynamically access more conformations at room temperature than at the cryogenic temperature”. While that is probably mostly true, examples such as cold-denaturation suggest it isn’t universally true.

While the authors have presented phasing as the major accomplishment here, we find the modifications to the data collection process much more interesting. Firstly, any diffraction dataset at this resolution should be amenable to ab initio phasing, if the intensities are measured accurately enough. Secondly, the conditions under which such accurate intensity measurements can be made and how accurate they need to be to enable phasing are not adequately explored here; this is a proof-of-concept but not yet fleshed out in a way that lets us know how useful it will be. The description of how this was enabled, by contrast, is very well-detailed and immediately valuable to the scientific community. We will address both foci of the paper but will recommend the authors either shift the narrative to better center this work's strengths or carry out additional computational experiments. First, regarding phasing/the accuracy of the intensities: Building on this group's tremendous effort to advance the capability of microED to produce high-resolution crystal structures from nanocrystals on TEM grids from only minutes of data collection, the authors now present proof of concept for ab initio phasing of small proteins from such datasets. Whereas molecular replacement has all but obsoleted ab initio phasing of proteins with known structures or homologs, truly new structures remain nontrivial to determine by crystallography, where unmeasured phases limit us. Still, the short data collection times for microED, relative ease of preparation of nanocrystalline samples, and increasing accessibility of electron microscopes could make ab initio phasing a powerful option. The capability for ab initio phasing of macromolecules is therefore, in this context, another core strength of the method. The prospect of using direct methods for phasing structures missing easily discernible secondary structures is a natural next step. The authors probe the limits of the datasets in the current manuscript, describing multiple attempts at phasing and detailing which did and did not come to fruition, and suggest further routes for optimization. There is further analysis possible here that we would very much like to see: - Why are the resulting R-factors so poor compared with X-ray crystallographic structures of comparable resolution? If the authors apply the same phasing methods to X-ray and microED datasets of the same molecule side-by-side, what differences emerge? What fundamental differences can we expect between datasets from these two methods, including major sources of error, and how should we plan to account for them? The availability of HEWL structure factors from XRD ( http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S0907444997013656), with very low R-factors, could also enable an analysis of the errors in the intensities derived from microED, with very high R-factors, which we would be very keen to read. - Thinking now of applicability beyond model systems, at what resolution/accuracy of intensity measurements (both of which might be limiting in other cases for microED) should we expect ab initio phasing to be possible? While the space of potential fragment inputs is explored, the only exploration of the structure factor inputs are the lysozyme or proteinase K datasets. Truncations and noise additions to these datasets can provide a guide of the applicability of the method and the importance of the new, more accurate, data collection setup. We find the very thorough description of all stages of instrument setup, sample preparation and data processing to be indispensable. The authors describe in detail what steps were taken to ensure the experiment was physically possible and why they were necessary. Most importantly, using the microscope in diffraction mode is normally incompatible with the dynamic range of the detector, so the authors describe overriding an engineering control that disables the camera in diffraction mode and selecting a variety of instrument settings (spot size, C2 aperture, beam size, microprobe mode, and exposure time) to keep the dose per frame as low as possible. Their successful ab initio structure solution of proteinase K and lysozyme using this setup and standard crystallography data processing software is a convincing proof of concept of this setup. Framed a little differently, this work could certainly stand on its own as a description of the instrumental setup necessary to produce these datasets. In summary, the manuscript is generally well-written, detailed and clear. It is accessible to the average cryoEM microscopist as well as sufficiently complete from the perspective of a methods developer. Aside from our concerns with the framing of the limits of applicability to different resolutions and intensity accuracies, we find no major issues with the work that should delay its wider adoption.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.02.466983v1#comment-5612427638,biorxivstage,1,"Congratulations on this major breakthrough. The new cryo-EM structures of inactive-state GPCRs are a great advancement and certainly overcome several inherent limitations of crystal structures, which so far have been the only way to solve these receptor conformations. However, we would like to point out two issues with the current version of the manuscript: 1) To compare the cryo-EM approach with crystallography, the new cryo-EM structure of the hNTSR1:SR48692 complex is compared with a crystal structure of rNTSR1 bound to the same ligand, which has recently been reported by our lab (ref. 16; DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abe5504; PDB ID: 6ZIN). However, we have to note that an essential part of our work was not considered in this comparison of cryo-EM and crystallography, resulting in (i) a potentially misleading description of some differences and (ii) an unnecessary downplay of the crystallographic approach. As mentioned by the authors, most crystal structures of GPCRs require prior protein stabilization. This has also been the case in our study, which resulted in a first structure of the rNTSR1:SR48692 complex (PDB ID: 6ZIN) using the NTSR1-H4 mutant. However, we realized that four stabilizing mutations were likely to affect some of the receptor structural features. Thus, in the same study, we reverted those four mutations to the wild-type residues, giving rise to NTSR1-H4bm and a second structure of the rNTSR1:SR48692 complex (PDB ID: 6Z4S). The structure of this back-mutant represents a more native-like rNTSR1:SR48692 complex, obtained already prior to the cryo-EM structure. Consequently, we believe that a fair comparison of the cryo-EM structure with a crystal structure requires the consideration of the back-mutant in the first place, which is not the case in the current manuscript. Comparison with the back-mutant would allow, e.g., a better discrimination of which differences naturally occur between human and rat NTSR1, which is crucial for drug design. Thus, some structural aspects detailed in the current manuscript need to be reconsidered: - The difference in the position of TM1. As stated in our study (ref. 16; DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abe5504), we suspected that the position of TM1 was affected by crystal packing forces in the structure of NTSR1-H4. However, this is not the case in the back-mutated construct (NTSR1-H4bm), as has been nicely confirmed by the cryo-EM structure. The conformation of ECL2 and the intracellular half of TM7 are also more native-like in the back-mutant structure (the difference at Y7.53 between cryo-EM and crystal structure discussed by the authors is nonetheless present, and we agree that the DARPin fusion can influence the NPxxY region). - The differences in the residues beneath the ligand’s carboxylate group (e.g., 6.51, 6.54, 6.55, 7.42). We reverted the mutations at positions 2.61, 3.33, and 7.42 to their wild-type counterparts explicitly to provide a more native environment in these regions. Accordingly, the differences between the back-mutant structure and the cryo-EM structure are smaller or absent. It should also be considered that the cryo-EM and crystal structures could have captured partially different inactive receptor conformations. - In the structure of the back-mutant, we were able to model ECL3 and the sidechains of F344(7.28), Y347(7.31), and W339(ECL3) (although the electron density for the latter was weak).  Nonetheless, as pointed out in the preprint, some differences in the sequence between human and rat NTSR1 probably induce a slightly different conformation of the extracellular tip of TM7 and ECL3. The description of these differences is of great relevance to drug design. Crucially, the ligand-binding mode is nearly identical in the cryo-EM and crystal structures underlining the validity of both approaches. In addition, the observation that the inverse agonist SR48692 is accommodated in a substantially wider binding site compared to the agonist-bound structures, as pointed out in our study, has now been nicely confirmed. It is correct that the gain of knowledge from the crystal structures of our engineered NTSR1-DARPin fusion is mostly limited to the extracellular receptor portion — as explicitly stated in our study — and that the cryo-EM structure now overcomes this limitation (e.g., by describing the Na+ pocket) and confirms the validity of the ligand-binding site. 2) The second problem is related to the comparison between the density of the hNTSR1:SR48692 cryo-EM structure and the electron density of the rNTSR1:SR48692 crystal structure. While the quality of the density in the cryo-EM structure certainly allows one to overcome the limitations of the crystal structure (e.g., modeling of ECL1, Na+ and H2O), we believe that the current comparison is not entirely fair. If the crystallographic 2Fo−Fc map for the ligand (Fig. 2b) is contoured at a typical sigma=1.0, it also clearly features the chlorine atom of the chloroquinoline ring of SR48692. This is also true for the structure of the back-mutant mentioned above (PDB ID: 6Z4S), see fig. S5D and fig. S11A in ref. 16 (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abe5504). Thus, we believe that a fair comparison must include the 2Fo−Fc map contoured at sigma=1.0 and not only at sigma=1.25. In the end, it should be acknowledged that the electron density maps allowed unambiguous modeling of the ligand, and indeed the ligand-binding mode is nearly identical in the cryo-EM and crystal structures. To reiterate point 1 above, a comparison with the back-mutant in the first place makes more sense, and it does not reduce the impact of the cryo-EM structure (although the differences are vanishingly small, the ligand also adopts a more native binding mode in the back-mutant). Compared to the non-backmutated structure, the resolution of the back-mutant is very similar (2.71 Å), and the quality of the electron density allowed unambiguous modeling of most key residues (see fig. S12, A–C, in ref. 16 (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abe5504)).

One quick point is that the IRT model is also fit leaving out the test subject so, in terms of predictive performance on the test subject, the IRT estimates cannot be caused by their brain activity. Within the training set, the IRT is estimated from the behavioral data, which is necessarily driven by the neural activity of subjects in the training set. However, if a signal is ICEA, then it must be causally downstream of any stimulus properties. Therefore, it won’t just be correlated with average performance on a stimulus in the population, random fluctuations in an ICEA signal (given the same stimulus) will lead to fluctuations in memory performance. Without these random fluctuations predicting memory, it is essentially impossible to tell from observational data whether a signal is ICEA or not (because it could just represent memory-predictive stimulus properties). So because of the constraint that the IRT estimates are the same across subjects, they are uncorrelated with these random fluctuations and estimate essentially “pure confounds.”",2021-11-16T15:48:52,davidjacobhalpern,David Jacob Halpern,10.1101/2021.11.08.467782,Identifying Causal Subsequent Memory Effects,"David J.

This manuscript explores intricacies of the cooling process as it relates to structural ensembles. Specifically, how do variations in starting sample conditions (water layer thickness, water/sample starting temperature) and cooling (ethane layer thickness, rate of cooling) affect the distribution of structural states captured in the resulting micrographs? Can we be confident that the results of ""time-resolved"" cryoEM experiments are representative of barriers and basins we hope to capture? By a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and cryoEM experiments, the authors guide us to an empirical understanding of these questions. To understand the relationship between cooling and structural ensembles, we must begin with the thermodynamic principles in play. Ensembles represent the many possible conformational states of a structural unit, and the occupancies of the individual states depend on the energy landscape across which they are related. At the extremes, we may imagine an ensemble cooled instantaneously to 0 K, whose component structures would not be able to traverse the energy landscape in any direction, as well as an ensemble injected with enough energy to overcome any energy barrier on the landscape (i.e. a system at thermal equilibrium), whose component structures would move freely to occupy all possible states. In the latter case we would not expect all states to be occupied by the same number of particles, however — particles with exactly enough energy to breach a particular energy barrier are equally likely to fall to either side of it, but particles at different starting points with the same starting energy have different likelihoods of escaping their local energy minima. In aggregate, this produces the Boltzmann distribution, in which the populations of different states depend entirely on their relative energies. For intermediate temperatures, it is useful to speak in shorthand of energy barriers and a system's ability to overcome them. We believe the introduction of this manuscript deserves a more complete illustration of the fundamental principles, however, and would encourage the authors to possibly even add a diagram or two to aid in this effort. It is too easy to confuse the fact that cooled structures move toward global energy minima with the idea that cooling gives them the energy needed to overcome energy barriers, which is precisely the opposite of the truth. The abstract in particular ought to be reworded to avoid this misinterpretation. The design of the computational and wet lab experiments is carefully geared toward isolating the relevant variables and reproducing the relevant states and processes. For example, to choose the equilibration times to use in MD simulations, the authors first simulated how long it would take for samples of various thicknesses to vitrify. By and large we are satisfied with the parameters of these experiments, but we question one unsupported assumption: the authors enforced an ethane bath outer boundary held at constant temperature. This could be possible if the ethane bath remains in contact with a heat sink and the equilibration time between ethane and the heat sink is negligible compared with that between ethane and the sample, but we do not see this discussed or justified, nor is this standard practice when freezing grids, as the ethane bath is isolated from the standard liquid nitrogen heat sink after reaching the desired temperature to prevent the ethane from freezing solid. We were confused by the plot of equilibration times for ethane layers of different thicknesses, and hypothesize that the unexpected (to us) trend is a result of this boundary condition: we would have imagined a thicker ethane layer to allow quicker absorption of heat from the water layer, but the opposite is shown. Moreover, there is often a cold gas layer (see work by Rob Thorne on hyperquenching: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... and https://journals.iucr.org/m.... While this complication might be very difficult to simulate, it should be explained how it might affect the interpretation of results. Although it does not impact the methods or results of this paper, we are also unconvinced that the use of any vitrification bath held at a lower temperature than the commonly used ethane bath would necessarily result in faster freezing, as heat transfer is also dependent on heat capacity (hence the selection of ethane for plunge-freezing rather than liquid nitrogen!) Propane does indeed appear to have a higher heat capacity than ethane at similar cryogenic temperatures, so in the case of an ethane-propane mixture, this assumption does hold, but we would prefer the authors include this detail. As for the results of the study, it is well-evidenced and clearly presented that conformational distributions present before plunge-freezing are reflected in vitrified samples when a standard vitrification protocol is followed, and that the rate of cooling does indeed impact the degree to which these distributions are preserved. We especially applaud the authors' careful wording around what interpretations are supported or suggested by the data, leaving open the remote possibility of other explanations — they draw very clear distinctions between observations and analyses. This is good science! Finally, we find the implications of the study meaningful. The selection of a ribosomal complex as an example particle perfectly illustrates the biologically relevant range of flexibilities and temperature-dependent conformational ensembles. This example gives us an intuitive measuring stick for other types of structures. Taken as a whole, the analyses inform future ""time-resolved"" studies using cryoEM and the design of other experiments that depend on the preservation of a conformational ensemble by rapid cooling. This is a very exciting direction of inquiry that we will continue to watch with great interest! Minor points: - The authors could make the introduction even more clear and accessible by specifying that liquid specimens present a challenge because their vapor pressure is incompatible with high vacuum. - We favor the wording ""most often liquid ethane"" over ""mostly liquid ethane"" for describing the standard vitrification setup. - Sentences such as the second to last sentence in the second paragraph of the introduction could be broken into multiple sentences or otherwise simplified to avoid confusion among the several ""which,"" ""from"" and ""and"" clauses. - Sobolevsky’s work on TRP channels and vitrification probably deserves a mention in the intro alongside the other examples, esp. because those probe a natural temperature sensor! ( https://www.nature.com/arti..., https://www.nature.com/arti... - Tomography can be used to resolve position in ice layer, “Apart from the water-layer thickness, the temperature drop also depends on the position within the layer with the slowest drop in the center (Fig. 1a), which is relevant, because in the time between the spreading of the sample onto the grid and the plunging, the biomolecules tend to adsorb to the air-water interface 62.” ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... - The authors could comment on whether the effects of being in different parts of the ice layer would affect RMSF values. If the effects are not too small, reconstructions from different layers could yield B-factors that could deconvolute different effects! - Are there local effects to their RMSF kinetic/thermodynamic models in the ribosome? For example, could they subdivide RNA/Protein, small/large subunit, exterior/interior sites, etc? Are there any regions that increase conformational heterogeneity upon cooling (as we have seen often in multi temperature crystallography)? Using a global RMSF metric may be leaving out interesting phenomena. - Are the frames and code deposited somewhere for others to examine?

We used a pixel-wise regression model since it increases the effective number of datapoints and labels hence reducing overfitting. Having the spatial localization and event probability (regression) also allows us to inspect the quality of the detection more easily and in some cases prioritize events based on their progression and likelihood. Having said that, the choice of network is flexible and could be tailored to the system in question (so as you suggest, one could in principle reduce event detection to an image-wide classification or contrary - introduce more complex, spatially varying imaging responses based on the event probability maps).

We do, however, have a different model as to the role of this system as a homeostatic mechanism controlling sphingolipid biosynthesis. We consider the ORMDLs to be regulatory subunits of SPT which, like many regulatory subunits, are not intrinsically inhibitory until they are triggered by a ligand. Our evidence strongly indicates that the ligand for the SPT/ORMDL complex is ceramide.  With this in mind, we envision that the S1P regulation of ORMDL stability overlays an acute and direct ORMDL-dependent regulation of SPT by ceramide. In our view, the S1P-dependent stabilization of the ORMDLs maintains them as ceramide-sensitive regulators of SPT.  In the absence of S1P signaling, degradation of the ORMDLs renders the SPT complex insensitive to ceramide and therefore strongly increases SPT activity. Below we outline evidence which brings us to this view. But before doing so, we would like to emphasize one of the exciting and important aspects of the work outlined in this pre-print. Considering that S1P signaling is mediated by the G-protein linked S1P receptors (in this case S1PR1), it is an interesting possibility that other cell types with different requirements for control of sphingolipid biosynthesis will utilize the same downstream signaling, perhaps mediated by other G-protein receptors, to control ORMDL levels. A hint of this is found in the regulation of ORMDL turnover by cholesterol loading reported by Gulshan and colleagues (Autophagy. 2015;11(7):1207-8). The experiments that underlie our view of that the enzymatic activity of the SPT/ORMDL complex is directly responsive to ceramide levels is as follows. It is important to emphasize that the bulk of these studies were performed in Hela cells. The biochemistry of the SPT/ORMDL complex itself is likely independent of cell type, but additional regulatory mechanisms, such as those presented in this pre-print, are doubtless cell-type dependent: 1.	Sphingoid bases do not mediate an acute ORMDL-dependent regulation of SPT. We tested the identity of the sphingolipid that triggers ORMDL inhibition of SPT by feeding Hela cells sphingosine. This results in an almost complete inhibition of SPT.  This is consistent with the sphingosine inhibition of SPT activity in intact cells originally reported by Kondrad Sandhoff’s group (Mandon EC, van Echten G, Birk R, Schmidt RR, Sandhoff K.Eur J Biochem. 1991 Jun 15;198(3):667-74). This inhibition is entirely ORMDL-dependent.  Importantly, we demonstrated that sphingosine inhibition of SPT was completely blocked by preventing ceramide generation with the ceramide synthase inhibitor Fumonisin B1 (Figure 2 of J Biol Chem. 2012 Nov 23;287(48):40198-204 and  Figure 2 of J Biol Chem. 2019 Mar 29;294(13):5146-5156. ). Thus, inhibition by sphingosine requires its conversion to ceramide. S1P generation, enhanced by sphingosine feeding, is not blocked by Fumonisin B1, yet SPT inhibition is ablated.  Therefore, in this system, S1P does not appear to have a role in regulating SPT activity in Hela cells under the short-term conditions that we used.  We concluded from these experiments that the triggering sphingolipid is ceramide or a complex sphingolipid such as sphingomyelin or a glycosphingolipid, but not a sphingoid base. 2.	Elevation of ORMDL levels alone does not lead to SPT inhibition. We have shown that inhibition of SPT by ceramide In Hela cells and human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) cannot be explained by increased ORMDL protein expression. We do not observe an increase in ORMDL protein expression in response to C6-ceramide treatment of Hela Cells (Figure 5, Siow et al 2015), under conditions in which SPT activity is strongly inhibited.  And we demonstrate that ectopically increasing ORMDL protein expression in either Hela cells or HBEC does not result in inhibition of SPT activity (J Lipid Res. 2015 Apr;56(4):898-908).  In both of these cells there is sufficient ORMDL at steady state to serve the needs of SPT regulation, yet ceramide is strongly inhibitory. We make the point in this paper that the stoichiometry of ORMDL to SPT expression is important and make clear that it is likely that in some cell types changes in ORMDL expression will impact on SPT regulation. This is consistent with the response reported in this pre-print in response to S1P signaling. 3.	Biochemical reconstitution demonstrates a direct inhibitory effect of ceramide. We have reconstituted ceramide-triggered, ORMDL-dependent inhibition of SPT in isolated membranes in a biochemical assay in which neither protein synthesis, turnover, nor post-translational modifications can occur.  We are confident that this biochemical reconstitution reflects a physiological response of the SPT/ORMDL complex to ceramide. We demonstrated that the response to ceramide is strictly stereospecific with respect to ceramide stereoisomers.  Only the native, D-erythro ceramide stereoisomer triggers ORMDL-dependent inhibition of SPT.  Moreover, we addressed the possibility that the short-chain ceramides that we routinely use (for their solubility properties) might not reflect physiological inhibition.  We generated native chain-length ceramide in the isolated membranes using the endogenous ceramide synthases. This ceramide was strongly inhibitory (Figure 2 of J Biol Chem. 2019 Mar 29;294(13):5146-5156). 4.	The recently published structures of SPT/ORMDL complexes reinforces the view of the ORMDLs as regulatory subunits. The ORMDLs are firmly embedded in the structure. Moreover, comparison of the structures in the substrate-free and substrate-bound state indicates that the ORMDLs inhibit SPT via an amino-terminal sequence that reversibly inhabits the substrate binding site of SPT.  These structures suggest that the inhibitory sequence must be stabilized in the active site of the protein to achieve inhibition. We propose that ceramide binding to the complex accomplishes this stabilization. Taken together, our data and that presented in this pre-print form the picture that the ORMDLs are involved in multiple levels of regulation of SPT.  A direct and rapid inhibition by ceramide, and the loss of that regulation when the ORMDLs are degraded as a result of interrupted S1P signaling. There is doubtless more to come and we look forward to further discoveries illuminating regulation of this essential system and the physiological impact of that regulation.",2021-11-06T20:07:56,binkswattenberg,Binks Wattenberg,10.1101/2021.10.22.465503,S1P controls endothelial sphingolipid homeostasis via ORMDL,"Linda Sasset, Kamrul H.

The authors first demonstrated the pH dependence on photoprotection, specifically non photochemical quenching (NPQ) and showed that NPQ can be induced in the dark by acidic pH. They found that KEA3 modulates NPQ by impacting the proton motive force (PMF); indeed generated kea3 mutants showed increased partitioning into deltapH. Importantly they showed that diatom KEA3 in contrast to plant KEA3 possesses an EF hand motif which can bind Ca2+ and proposed that it controls KEA3 activity. The role of KEA3 and pH in affecting the NPQ response has been previously shown in other photosynthetic organisms however the novelty of this study lies in the demonstration that NPQ can be induced in the dark by acidic pH and the proposed role of Ca2+ in regulating KEA3 function. Major comments - Page 5, you state that pH-induced quenching in the dark was accompanied by the conversion of DD into DT. Please provide de-epoxidation state (DES) at t15 time (Fig. 1B) to substantiate this statement. Starting DES would also be informative to ensure there was no retention of DT/zeaxanthin in the dark. - Also to ensure there is no sustained NPQ (and/or damage or disconnected antenna) at t0, please provide Fo and Fm levels for all NPQ kinetics experiments. Assessing PSII accumulation by D1 immunoblot could be done to ensure PSII damage does not occur. - In Fig. 2F, it is not clear which data points represent HL or ML treatment as well as which ones come from light or dark period. Please indicate them in different colors or symbols. Also clarify whether you have averaged data from the kea3 mutant alleles. - To confirm that lack of complementation by deltaEF is not due to mislocalization, please show whether deltaEF accumulates at the thylakoid membrane. Minor comments - Page 3, Introduction, specify qE after NPQ response; PSBS should be written PsbS - Page 4, DD-dependent NPQ should be DT-dependent - Page 4, we suggest changing “crucial” to “Given the unknown role” if pH-dependence of NPQ in diatoms hasn’t been fully established before - Page 8, KEA3 most likely homolog, were there other homologs than the two shown in Fig. S5? also discuss conservation of other ion channels (is Phatr J11843 thylakoid-localised?) and if they could compensate for the absence of KEA3 in KO mutant (by being upregulated for instance). - Fig2B, comment on the band at ~80kDa in OE, is that from cleavage of GFP? - Fig2G, shouldn’t you expect a lower dpH in the OE? Please comment. - Page 13, for the statement that only dpH can modulate NPQ, we would suggest to tone down or specify that this is the assumption made here as it could be that dpsi modulates NPQ but has yet to be shown! - Most of the protein analyses were performed loading samples based on protein content, when possible please provide proof that chlorophyll levels are comparable between the genotypes (at least for the native gels) - Abstract, extra ‘of’ between capacity and via; page 23, extra ‘being’ between likely and less important - Define acronyms when used for the first time - There is a lot of ‘peculiar’ in the text ;-) - Fig. 2D, star symbol instead of square symbol, check consistency of symbols Pushan Bag, Pierrick Bru (Umeå University) - not prompted by a journal; this review was written within a preprint journal club with input from group discussion including Alizée Malnoë, Maria Paola Puggioni, Jingfang Hao, Jack Forsman, Wolfgang Schröder, Emma Cocco, Jianli Duan.",2021-11-05T16:17:02,alizee_malnoe,Alizée Malnoë,10.1101/2021.09.06.459119,Impaired photoprotection in Phaeodactylum tricornutum KEA3 mutants reveals the proton regulatory circuit of diatoms light acclimation,"Claire Seydoux, Mattia Storti, Vasco Giovagnetti, Anna Matuszyńska, Erika Guglielmino, Xue Zhao, Cécile Giustini, Yufang Pan, Jhoanell Angulo, Alexander V.

It appears to be a misinterpretation of the point of the Patharkar and Walker 2016 paper and is quite sensationalistic. Everyone in the abscission fields knows that ethylene plays a role in abscission (this has been known for decades). The point of the 2016 paper is that it shows that drought can trigger leaf abscission in Arabidopsis and it defines some of the molecular basis for that. When we first observed that Arabidopsis cauline leaves abscised in our growth chamber, we wanted to know why this was happening because it was not described in the literature. We did not find evidence of ethylene build up in our chamber and we found that exogenous application of ACC did not trigger abscission, rather we found water-deficit triggered the abscission. We make no claim that ethylene is ""not involved"" in abscission rather it is not the external stimuli that triggers abscission. Regardless of how our words are interpreted, our firm stance is that ethylene ""is involved"" in abscission as a hormone that positively regulates abscission. We have published multiple review articles that have diagrams that show this point. Here is the actual sentence that from the 2016 paper that uses the word ""triggered"" rather than ""involved"":  ""After sequentially ruling out differences in genotypes, pesticide treatment, and ethylene accumulation, we found leaf abscission can be triggered by withholding water until the plants began to wilt followed by rewatering (Fig. 1)."" Again, our view is that ethylene is a positive regulator of abscission but external stimuli like water-deficit or pathogen attack initiate the cauline leaf abscission pathway.

Coauthored by a consortium of current leaders in the field of population genetics, it states that ""the ability to fit the parameters of one's preferred model to data does not alone represent proof of biological reality."" They hope fellow practitioners, having been alerted by this ""simple truism,"" will avoid various pitfalls. Apart from concerns on synonymous site neutrality (2), calls to reconsider evolutionary fundamentals (3, 4) are not mentioned. The historical authority of William Provine is referred to (5). He described the early 20th century dispute between geneticist William Bateson and the ""Biometricians"" (Pearson and Weldon). While disputing Mendelism, the latter made outstanding contributions to statistics. However, Provine concluded The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics diffidently: ""With the gap between theoretical models and available observational data so large, population genetics began and continues with a theoretical structure containing obvious internal consistencies."" Despite these 1971 words and ""the wealth of data"" now available, that gap remains. To bridge, the authors appeal to ""interdisciplinarity … in order to connect genotype to phenotype"" (1). This should remind us that in the 1920s Bateson foresaw (3) ""that before any solution is attained, our knowledge of unorganized matter must first be increased."" So sadly, regarding his topic, genetics: ""For a long time we may have to halt."" It was only following great progress in molecular biology, that in the 1970s WWII bomber pilot Richard Grantham, at the Université de Lyon, was able to ask the very question the authors pose (1): ""Whether, and if so how, accurate evolutionary inferences can be extracted from DNA sequences sampled from a population?"" In the authors' words (1), Grantham was able to use ""molecular variation and divergence data to infer evolutionary processes."" What Grantham called his ""genome hypothesis"" (6) was later related to the earlier ideas of Darwin's research associate, George Romanes, and Bateson (3). While readily adopting Bateson's coinages – homozygote, heterozygote, allelomorph, epistasis, homeotic, meristic – the modern-day biometricians (1) have overlooked the most fundamental of his ideas, the ""residue"" (3), as they did Grantham's ""genome hypothesis"" and Romanes' ""collective variation."" Likewise, to make the mathematics easier, they embraced the neutral ideas of Kimura (2), instead of the ""homostability"" ideas of his compatriot, Akiyoshi Wada (7), who pressed unsuccessfully for a Japanese ""genome project,"" which would have anticipated by many years that of the USA (8). The works of Grantham, Romanes and Bateson, together with those of various Russian evolutionists and Richard Goldschmidt, focus on the fundamental distinction between inter-species""macroevolution"" and intra-species""microevolution"" (7). This crystallized historically in 1990 in the lectures and writings of the Russian specialist, Mark Adams. He stressed that the understanding of macroevolution would demand ""a radically new interpretation of the history of Darwinism, population genetics and the evolutionary synthesis."" For ""if intra- and inter-specific variation differ not in kind, but only in degree, then it is possible, by extension, to envision selection as the creator of a new species. But if varieties are fundamentally different from species – if the fundamental character of intraspecific and interspecific variation is essentially different – then the effect of selection on a population cannot explain evolution.""
