Dan taught me how to think mechanistically, how to test assumptions, and how to pursue scientific clarity with unflinching rigor. That legacy is all over this paper. And is incredibly needed in this era of AI hype where data volume often sidelines careful model-driven science. Herschlag et al. show that while AlphaFold3 predicts protein structures with backbone-level structural precision, it struggles to capture the physical rules that govern biological function. But this paper isn’t a takedown: it’s a roadmap for how to go further. What They Did Rather than rely on RMSD alone, the team evaluated AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3 against: →Energetic rules: bond torsions, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals contacts →Experimental ensembles: from multi-temperature crystallography →Model confidence: comparing pLDDT to physical plausibility What They Found: ~30% of side-chain interactions deviated from experimental observations, often with incorrect partners or implausible geometries High-confidence predictions (>90 pLDDT) still showed strained or physically invalid conformations Energetically-favorable conformations could increase RMSD and be penalized by the model AlphaFold3 missed ~85% of conformational variability seen in real experimental ensembles Key Insight: Physics ≠ Proximity AlphaFold can recapitulate Ramachandran and Lennard-Jones-like patterns. But that doesn’t mean it understands physical constraints. To improve these tools, we need evaluation metrics grounded in molecular energetics, not just geometry. 🎯 Takeaway for Scientists This paper is a reminder that progress requires more than prettier predictions. It demands models that reflect the physics that drive biology.",2025-07-29T17:20:59,disqus_qHy3oBjxd0,Kristin G,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.15.664939v2#comment-6741788142,biorxivstage,1,"Interesting analysis. In light of the reliance on MeSH subject indexing, I draw your attention to NLM's own data on the performance of machine indexing approaches in different categories, documented in the NLM Technical Bulletin: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/ma24/ma24_mtix.html. The check tag category (which includes the species labels on which the OPA iCite tool relies) F1 score (combining precision and recall) for MTIX (introduced in 2024) was 87% versus the original (human) indexing approach -- that is, significantly lower performance. And for a period of time before the introduction of MTIX, NLM was using a different machine indexing system, MTIA, whose F1 score for the check tag category was only 62% compared with human indexing. So, depending on when MTIA started to be used, and the proportion of records that were indexed with MTIA versus human indexers, I wonder how confident we can be that the relative proportions of different categories of MeSH terms truly reflect the prevalence of different categories of research over time. I also note, in the same source, that the performance of MTIA and MTIX at appropriately labeling Medline articles with supplementary concept terms was even worse than their performance with check tags: 39% and 71% versus human indexing. Supplementary concept terms are especially relevant to innovative, novel science (including basic science) -- terms that may in the future become MeSH terms. It's perhaps not surprising that tools trained on historical data are not great at handling novel concepts, but poor performance by machine indexing tools at applying appropriate supplementary concept records may be another factor in the apparent decline in basic science research. I'd also like to comment on the iCite Translation Module (of which the Human/Animal/MCB category assignment is part). I'm not really clear on how many PubMed records get such category labels. On the one hand, iCite includes all PubMed records. On the other hand, presumably only articles with MeSH terms can be assigned in the Triangle of Biomedicine -- that is, articles in journals that are indexed in PMC but not Medline are not included in the human/animal/MCB analysis. I assume that the proportion of PubMed records with Medline indexing has gone down, as NIH-funded authors publish more papers in journals that aren't indexed in Medline (many of which didn't exist at the start of this longitudinal analysis). Indeed, thanks to Ed Sperr's handy tool PubMed-By-Year, we can see that Medline records (ie, records with MeSH terms that can be analyzed by the human/animal/MCB categories in iCite) as a proportion of PubMed records was above 90% until (I am eyeballing the figure at https://esperr.github.io/pubmed-by-year/?q1=medline [sb]&startyear=1990) around 2011, at which point Medline coverage started declining quite precipitously. So, any analysis that relies so heavily on MeSH indexing is going to be leaving out a large number (and an increasing proportion) of recent papers.",2025-07-23T15:35:02,,Kate Nyhan,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.14.664673v1#comment-6740532082,biorxivstage,1,"The article presents compelling anatomical evidence for a distinct Intermediate Leptomeningeal Layer (ILL) in the human CNS; however, critics may point out that it remains a preprint lacking peer review, and its conclusions are primarily based on postmortem specimens with limited demographic diversity. The specificity of immunohistochemical markers used to define the ILL is debatable, as several are not exclusive to this layer. Furthermore, while the study suggests functional roles in CSF dynamics and immune surveillance, these claims are largely inferential, without direct in vivo or radiological validation. Technical constraints in ultrastructural imaging and overlapping interpretations with known meningeal modifications also raise questions about whether the ILL represents a truly novel anatomical layer or a reinterpretation of existing structures. Sample Limitations: The study uses 61 specimens, including postmortem adults and fetal cadavers, but lacks detailed demographic or pathological stratification. Results may not be generalizable across age groups, disease states, or different causes of death. Also, tissue autolysis postmortem could influence histological findings. Interpretation of Immunohistochemistry: The identification of the ILL largely hinges on marker expression (e.g., Podoplanin, Prox1, Lyve-1, Claudin-11). However Some markers used are not exclusive to the ILL. There is overlap in marker expression with other leptomeningeal cells, which may complicate interpretation. The specificity of these markers to a distinct anatomical layer may be overstated. Conceptual Ambiguity: The ILL is described as both structurally distinct and continuous with modifications of the pia (e.g., filum terminale, ligamentum denticulatum), which introduces conceptual overlap. This may challenge the claim of a fourth meningeal layer as a standalone structure, as it could also be interpreted as a differentiation of existing leptomeningeal tissue. Functional Claims Require More Evidence: The paper suggests that the ILL has barrier and immune surveillance functions, but these are inferred from: Marker expression (e.g., E-cadherin, CD68, CD3) and Limited injury models (e.g., trauma cases). Functional conclusions are suggestive but not definitively demonstrated, especially regarding CSF dynamics and immune response. Lack of In Vivo or Radiological Correlation: Despite discussing imaging evidence in the introduction, the study does not provide radiological correlation (e.g., MRI, contrast-enhanced studies) to support the anatomical observations. Without clinical imaging, it's difficult to ascertain how (or whether) the ILL can be visualized or detected in living subjects. Technical Limitations in TEM/SEM: The authors acknowledge challenges in visualizing the ILL using Transmission Electron Microscopy due to the width of the human SAS. Consequently, ultrastructural validation is incomplete and fragmented. Conclusions about junctional integrity and macrophage-like cells at the ultrastructural level may lack comprehensive support. Historical Oversight or Reinterpretation: While the authors cite historical literature that may have alluded to similar structures, they assert that ILL has never been clearly identified. Critics might argue this is a reinterpretation of known anatomical variants rather than a truly novel finding. This raises questions about whether the ILL is a distinct layer or a rediscovery framed through a modern methodological lens. Need for Functional Studies (In Vivo / Genetic Models): Unlike recent mouse studies (e.g., SLYM in mice), this study does not include functional in vivo or genetic data (e.g., knockout models, CSF tracer studies) to show the physiological importance of the ILL. This limits translational relevance and understanding of how the ILL may impact neurological diseases or therapeutic interventions.",2025-07-21T02:00:55,,Padamjeet Panchal,,,,

I'm wondering whether other DNA extraction protocols might improve your viability inference, as other protocols might better retain original DNA fragment sizes (which are likely lower for extracellular DNA). For example, we usually use enzymatic lysis and magnetic bead purification for ONT sequencing, since it seems to better protect DNA integrity: https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-023-09537-5. We generally see larger reads for freshly extracted isolates than for stored metagenomes, and we see large differences in read sizes between strains in microbiome samples. We think this could be related to how easily different species are lysed throughout the protocol, but we didn't test this yet. In our hands, bead-beating and spin columns caused read lengths to be lower and to have a more homogeneous size distribution.",2025-07-18T12:54:57,brambloemen,Bram Bloemen,,,,

The dysregulation of the DDR in deciliated cholangiocytes in intriguing. However, I am surprised to see you never mention the process of cellular senescence in your manuscript. Cellular senescence is known to be linked to a disturbed DDR and is frequently induced using the genotoxic stress models (irradiation, induction of double or single strand-DNA breaks) you use for your experiments. It would therefore be very interesting if deciliation in your model impacts the rates of cellular senescence (e.g. changes in cell morphology, markers of senescence, SASP, etc). In your manuscript you also show, that deciliation affects the ATM-p53-p21 axis and that p53 and p21 levels following genotoxic stress are lower in deciliated NHCs. p53 and p21 are again markers frequently used to assess cellular senescence and if downregulated would indicate lower rates of cellular senescence, a finding contradicting our recently published results where deciliation of primary cholangiocytes (K19Cre Kif3a flox) triggered a DDR and induced cellular senescence both in vitro and in vivo. I therefore think it would be beneficial to discuss this contradictory findings in your discussion section. I would also recommend to add a paragraph about cellular senescence as the genotoxic assays you use are frequently used to induce cellular senescence in vitro, yet this important biological mechanism is never mentioned in your manuscript.",2025-07-17T10:45:06,,Hannah Esser,,,,

For each gene that is expressed in an input cell, we can assign all the genetic perturbation types that the model has been trained on. In our case they would be: CRISPR-a, CRISPR-i, CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-Cas13, ORF Overexpression, and no-perturbation. So for each gene, we have six options. Since we only bruteforce on single perturbations, we'll have 6 x (number of expressed genes) genetic perturbations, plus the 211 chemical perturbations. So if a cell has 1000 genes expressed, we'd have 6,211 ""counterfactuals"" to test, i.e., run inference on. That would be our search space. We tried a basic gradient-based method, where we froze all layers except the input layer, and tried to basically find an input that would maximize the given output (post-perturbation transcriptional profile). Unfortunately, this method didn't work immediately. I think this is a good area for future research. Yes, some other papers have referred to this as in-silico ""reverse perturbation"".

Some of the terminology used in the paper is somewhat ambiguous, in particular ""basal population"". In the literature, basal is used both to refer to the bipotent/MaSC-like cells that reside in the basal layer and for myoepithelial cells and myoepithelial progenitors that are also basally located. Basal cells described in this manuscript are said to be EpCAM+CD49fhi, which is consistent with basally located bipotent/MaSC-like progenitors. Luminal progenitors also express both of these markers, but they would be EpCAMhiCD49f+ (or EpCAM+CD49flo - these cells in the paper are just labeled as luminal, not as luminal progenitors, although mature luminal cells are expected to be CD49f-). The findings of the study would be communicated in a much clearer way if ambiguous terms were made more specific (e.g. ""basal bipotent progenitors"" instead of ""basal cells"", and ""luminal progenitors"" or ""mature luminal cells"" instead of just ""luminal cells""). In one sentence, CD49 instead of CD49f is used, which should be corrected.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.21.595224v2#comment-6734743798,biorxivstage,1,"This paper examines the evolution of X chromosome dosage compensation in nematodes. There are several interesting findings. The condensin-mediated dosage compensation complex is shown to have evolved recently in the Caenorhabditis lineage. In addition, a different duplication of SMC-4 occurred in two Pristionchus species, suggesting that Pristionchus independently evolved a similar condensin-mediated mechanism of dosage compensation (“parallel evolution”). Caenorhabditis and Pristionchus share other signatures of condensin-mediated dosage compensation, namely X-specific topologically-associating domains (TADs) and enrichment of the H4K20me1 chromatin mark on the X chromosome. The data supporting these conclusions are strong and the underlying experiments are rigorous. Additional interesting observations are made regarding dosage compensation mechanisms in two other nematode lineages, Oscheius and Steinernema. Oscheius is found to lack X-specific TADs, but has enrichment of H4K20me1, while Steinernema lacks both X-specific TADs and H4K20me1 enrichment. These results suggest that condensin-mediated dosage compensation may have evolved in the presence of an existing mechanism that involves H4K20me1. Additionally, Oscheius is shown to have X chromosome dosage compensation, but in Steinernema, dosage compensation is found to be incomplete. Unlike the results for Caenorhabditis and Pristionchus, some of the data for Oscheius and Steinernema are not as clear-cut and thus, the support for some of the conclusions is not as strong. There are perhaps a few places where the caveats could be pointed out and the conclusions toned down, but for the most part, I think the authors are appropriately cautious in interpreting their data. Overall, this is an interesting study that raises further interesting questions about how dosage compensation mechanisms evolve and are constrained. I have only relatively minor comments. 1. TADs. Hi-C data shown in Fig 2B are used to infer whether X-chromosome TADs are present. The data are quite clear for P. pacificus (TADs), C. elegans (TADs), and O. tipulae (no TADs). C. remanei is also scored as having X-specific TADs, though the TAD features are less obvious. It is argued that this is because the C. remanei data come from mixed-stage and mixed-sex worms (published elsewhere), so features specific to female X chromosomes in somatic cells would be diluted out. This is a reasonable argument. Also, in Fig 2B, Steinernema hermaphroditum is inferred not to have X-specific TADs. But to my eye (admittedly untrained for Hi-C data), the S. hermaphroditum pattern looks very similar to C. remanei. And the S. hermaphroditum data (also published elsewhere) has the same caveat as C. remanei of coming from mixed-stage animals that makes the TAD features less obvious. Additionally, the S. hermaphroditum data were obtained using a different Hi-C method that is restriction enzyme-independent. So it is unclear how it is conclusively determined that C. remanei has TADs and S. hermaphroditum doesn’t, especially given that the data come from different labs using different methods. Further explanation of the criteria used to score these data and make these conclusions would be useful. 2. Dosage compensation. Data show that all species analyzed except Steinernema carpocapsae have clear dosage compensation. S. carcocapsae data are somewhat less clear. Fig 4E shows that for two X-linked scaffolds, expression in females is higher than males, indicating a lack of complete dosage compensation. However, the difference is less than two-fold, suggesting that there is some dosage compensation. Also, of the two-scaffolds, the difference is only statistically significant for one of the two (Fig S11), even though both are X-linked, weakening the conclusion that this species lacks dosage compensation. Is it possible that the lack of full dosage compensation could be due to contamination of the data with more germline expressed genes? 3. The authors suggest the interesting possibility that the lack of complete dosage-compensation in Steinernema may be due to a couple of autosome to sex chromosome fusions in this species. In this case, one might expect full dosage compensation in some parts of the chromosome, and no dosage compensation in others. Can the data be analyzed to determine if dosage compensation varies in different regions of the Steinernema X chromosome, especially corresponding to different nigon elements? Or is there partial dosage compensation all along the X? 4. H4K20me1. Based on the data in Fig 5, the authors conclude that like C. elegans, P. pacificus and O. tipulae have H4K20me1 enrichment on the X chromosome, but S. hermaphroditum does not. The data for C. elegans and S. hermaphroditum are quite clear. However, there appears to be less H4K20me1 enrichment in P. pacificus and O. tipulae in the chromosome-wide data shown in Fig 5A. In both these species, there appears to be a higher level of H4K20me1 on the representative autosome, and to my eye, O. tipulae does not even show enrichment on the X. Is it possible to quantify levels of enrichment between species on autosomes and the X? It would be nice to see the ChIP-Seq tracks for all autosomes in a supplemental figure, not just the single representative autosomes shown in Fig 5A. To their credit, the authors recognize that X enrichment of H4K20me1 is weaker in O. tipulae and do statistics to back up their claim, but the statistics seem to be done only on H4K20me1 enrichment in gene bodies. Is there a difference between enrichment on the whole chromosome versus gene bodies in O. tipulae? 5. In the discussion, the authors suggest based on parsimony that dosage compensation was present in the common ancestor of the different nematode groups, but lost in the lineage leading to Steinernema. Though I agree this is the most likely scenario, isn’t it equally parsimonious to say that the common ancestor lacked dosage compensation, but that it evolved separately in Brugia (i.e. two gains of dosage compensation in nematodes instead of one gain and one loss)? So should it be stated that the authors’ model is the most parsimonious? Reviewed (and signed) by Michael Ailion",2025-07-09T15:55:47,michaelailion,Michael Ailion,,,,

Without data on how many times each test was repeated, it is not possible to determine whether the results are consistent or could be due to chance. Moreover, the absence of statistical analysis reinforces this weakness, as there are no other indicators provided to assess data variability. There are also areas for improvement in the results section. There is inadequate numbering of tables and inconsistencies between the tabulated content and what is described in the text. For example, zones of inhibition are mentioned for certain extracts that are not accurately reflected in the tables, leading to confusion. The descriptions of the results are unclear and, in some cases, redundant, lacking an interpretive analysis that would help in understanding the findings. The figures include unclear captions, and there is reuse of images without any apparent differentiation. Likewise, it is not evident that they meet the technical standards required for publication, which affects the visual quality and transparency of the work. Given that the inhibition halo is the main indicator of antimicrobial activity, greater care is expected in its graphical documentation. Additionally, some of the content presented in the results, such as the morphological description of the bacteria and the general chemical profile of the plants, should be located in the introduction as part of the theoretical framework.

In addition, histological validation of recovery reinforces the robustness of the model. However, it induces chemical damage rather than mimicking the pathophysiology of human ulcerative colitis (autoimmune), so it does not fully capture the immunological complexity in humans. Although the study used 23 mice for the SHARE-seq experiments, it would be advisable to increase the number of animals and perform more replicates, as the response to DSS damage and the recovery process may vary between individuals. This may affect the proportion of stem cells with high accessibility to AP-1 sites. As this subpopulation represents only 9%, a larger sample helps to confirm that this phenomenon is not due to chance or differences between a few individuals. Regarding the temporality of genetic memory, epigenetic marks show persistence up to 21–22 days post-colitis, but longer periods are not explored. Longer-term studies would help define the actual duration of memory and its potential reversibility, which would be crucial for assessing clinical relevance. The recommendation would be to add this as a section on limitations. In terms of structure, the preprint is clearly and logically organized. It begins with a solid introduction that contextualizes the relationship between inflammation and cancer. Some experimental results related to the SHARE-TRACE technique and its validation are intermingled with the main biological findings, which may make it difficult for readers who are not experts in molecular biology or epigenomics to understand. The use of figures and diagrams is appropriate and visually reinforces the complex data. However, some may be too visually dense. In certain cases, multiple complex panels are included in a single figure. Improve the readability of the axes, scales, and legends in some figures. Use more contrasting colors that are suitable for people with color blindness in order to distinguish the experimental conditions better.

It is particularly valuable due to its scalability and the use of already available public data. However, its implementation presents methodological and structural limitations that must be urgently addressed to ensure robust and applicable results. The exclusive reliance on GenBank introduces clear geographic and taxonomic biases, as regions such as Eastern and Northern Europe are underrepresented, as well as ecologically dominant families like Asteraceae and Rosaceae. This unequal coverage can distort the patterns of genetic diversity presented, affecting the representativeness of the index. Moreover, reducing genetic diversity to a single metric π significantly limits the analysis, excluding key aspects such as heterozygosity, genetic differentiation, and population structure, which are fundamental to assessing genetic health and connectivity. Another important issue is that the GDI assigns equal weight to all species, without distinguishing those that are rare, functionally important, or endangered. This may lead to a biased prioritization that favors regions with more available data rather than those with greater conservation urgency. Additionally, the study does not present a clear proposal for how to integrate the GDI into public policies, restoration plans, or protected area systems, nor does it consider current threats such as land-use change or habitat loss. Therefore, we recommend complementing GenBank with other genetic databases such as EMBL, BOLD, or GBIF; incorporating additional metrics that better reflect actual genetic diversity; establishing ecological weighting criteria among species; and linking the index’s results with real-world conservation scenarios and decision-making. With these adjustments, the GDI could become not only a methodologically robust tool, but also a practical, equitable, and useful instrument for the global conservation of genetic biodiversity.",2025-07-08T17:07:35,dannyyupa,Danny Yupa,,,,

For example, only a few danger signals were used, which does not represent all possible predators for all prey species. Ungulate mammals do not sense fear or risk towards owl sounds or fox urine, as these are not their predators par excellence. At this point, the number and variability of risk signals, such as bear urine or urine from a larger predator, could be expanded. In addition, it was done in a single region, so the results cannot be automatically applied to other areas such as rainforests or agricultural areas. Another point of improvement is the low detectability of some species (such as squirrel or dormouse) limits the statistical power of certain models. In future studies it would be beneficial to expand the sampling effort or to complement with other techniques such as environmental genomics (feces, fur). The use of baits (canned sardines) to attract animals to the chambers is mentioned. This type of attractant may artificially increase the frequency of visits and modify spatial patterns of movement, which would generate a bias in the estimates of activity and detection, thus compromising the validity of inferences about spontaneous behaviors related to risk perception. Despite this, the article is a great contribution, because it shows that fear changes the lives of animals even without direct contact with a predator, which is important to improve how we protect wildlife and manage ecosystems.

The authors address this gap in the literature by compiling one of the most impressive multi-omic profiles of T cells within any neurodegenerative disease to date. Assays performed on Cingulate Cortex and Substantia Nigra of PD patients include: targeted sequencing methods to determine clonal expansion, single nuclei RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, predictive algorithms to determine interactions between T cells other cells in their respective regions, and immunohistochemistry. Of note, the authors found that tissue resident memory (TRM) phenotypes were present within these PD-T cells. The findings in this paper relating to T cells are robust and well supported, however several claims concerning astrocyte regional diversity lack appropriate evidence. Overall, the study design(s) make the most of a rare cell type and these data appear to be a rich resource to those studying glial dysfunction in PD. Major concerns: 1.	The study focuses on T cells, however adds several analyses investigating their astrocytes alone or T cell-astrocyte interaction. How many of these conclusions comes from analyses done in paired samples? a.	How do conclusions drawn from unpaired samples across region affect the authors’ conclusions? b.	What are the sources of variability between regions that may also explain the lack of T cells in the cingulate cortex? Where these measures taken into account in any astrocyte analysis (i.e. covarying braak, sex, etc in astrocyte DEG?) 2.	scHPF analysis to describe factors in this dataset appears to be convincing as factor 5 overlapped with TRM gene sets and the authors validated via IHC that T cells in the PD brain expressed TRM marker CD103. However based on figure 2i, it appears that factor 5 is highest in Oligodendrocytes, followed by Astrocytes, then T cells. Could the authors further describe how scHPF T-Cells factors were selected in 2k and whether they make up the majority of this factor set? 3.	Spatial deconvolution with the authors’ new SCC equation appears to give good evidence that T cells are in proximity to oligodendrocytes, confirming what was observed with T cell counts in white matter. It is unclear which data support the claim “we found high significance in the spatial relationship between T-cells and T-cell disease factor in PD, and lack of significance in controls”. It does not appear to be in Fig 7 where I would expect it. Minor concerns/comments: •	Possible typo pg 10: are the sections for IHC 7 millimeters (mm) thick? Or 7 micrometers thick? •	“Nuclei that did not conform to cell types were presumed to be doublets or artifactual noise and removed.” Since no formal doublet detection or ambient RNA correction was done, could the authors specify how many nuclei were removed in this fashion or markers that were used to determine lack of conformation? •	Lack of neuronal diversity in the clustering performed on CC initially seemed unexpected, however the authors do I nice job in the supplemental figures. Could the authors similarly report T cell markers used to determine cell state? And possibly counts per donor? The only descriptors of those T cells I could find were the markers in Supp Table 4.",2025-07-08T13:37:00,dominicacri,Dominic Acri,,,,

However, the article’s interpretation, contextual framing, and supporting evidence for these claims raise several scientific and methodological concerns. The authors posit an apparent paradox, specifically, that low aqueous Se concentrations and elevated fish muscle Se concentrations. This is presented as an alarming ecological signal, and supports the thesis that the Se in these fish has accumulated over many years despite low aqueous concentrations. The assumption here is that Se has potentially cycled within the food web; however, a more fulsome historical understanding of this system is required to make this link. Specifically, were aqueous Se concentrations historically higher, and then declined more recently? If this were the case, comparing current water Se concentrations to current fish tissue concentrations is an “apples vs oranges” scenario. While elevated tissue Se in fish certainly warrants further investigation (i.e., are populations and/or fish health being impacted?), this ‘paradox’ is actually not inherently unusual. Selenium bioaccumulates, particularly in food webs involving algae, invertebrates and fish/birds, and tissue concentrations can remain elevated for years after aqueous exposures have declined, particularly in lentic waters with longer residence times. Without time-resolved aqueous and tissue Se data, it is at best speculative to interpret these findings as alarming, or even ecologically significant. The article does not present any data or evidence of historical Se concentrations in water or biota to support its claims of historical or ongoing accumulation. The article presents new Se fish tissue data, but fails to reference any previous monitoring efforts in Crowsnest Lake or nearby waterbodies. Consequently, one cannot assess trends in Se (i.e., whether concentrations are increasing, stable, or anomalous). This is significant, since it would need to be demonstrated that high concentrations had been sustained in order for Se to bioaccumulate in aquatic biota tissues. Moreover, there is no attempt to address the mobility patterns of the fish species sampled, which is a significant omission, given the authors’ assertion that the Se in the system originated from the two decommissioned mines2. For example, species like brown trout and mountain whitefish may use tributaries for spawning or feeding, potentially exposing them to elevated Se concentrations outside the lake. If this is the case, then the lake itself may not have been the primary source of Se accumulation. Without tools like radiotelemetry, tagging, or isotopic forensics, the source attribution to Crowsnest Lake or Tent Mountain is speculative. The authors themselves acknowledge that the fish populations reported on in the paper (i.e., brown trout, lake trout, and mountain whitefish) in Crowsnest Lake are “self-sustaining”; they then suggest that current tissue Se concentrations may lead to a “population collapse” or “reproductive failure”. This contradiction is neither reconciled nor supported with data on recruitment, deformities, or reproductive metrics. The reference to such a collapse is not only unsupported, but actually conflicts with their own admission of population persistence. The article further suggests that Whirling Disease and Se toxicity could have overlapping symptoms, possibly confounding diagnoses. This suggestion is completely speculative and unsubstantiated. No peer-reviewed evidence to-date links Se-induced pathologies in fish to the clinical signs of Myxobolus cerebralis infection (the cause of Whirling Disease). A central assumption of the paper is that Se is leaching into the lake from historical waste rock from the closed Tent Mountain mine. However, the authors provide no chemical fingerprinting, hydrological modeling, or sediment Se profiles to demonstrate a link. As such, the attribution again remains speculative and circumstantial. Phrases such as “devastating consequences,” “complete reproductive failure,” and “acute threat” are used throughout the paper without any corresponding ecological data. These statements are alarmist and do not reflect the chronic, sub-lethal, nature of Se toxicity in aquatic ecosystems; it is well known that Se is not acutely toxic at environmental concentrations and does not cause sudden population collapses in the absence of sustained exposure and bioaccumulation. Figure 2 compares Se concentrations across fish species and regions, but does not control for species-specific bioaccumulation potential, life stage, or habitat use. Comparing lake trout to other fish in other regions is both inappropriate and misleading. Species-specific comparisons are more relevant, and a consideration of whether the fish inhabit lentic vs lotic systems would make the comparison more valid and informative. Furthermore, no effort is made to explain the geological and ecological differences among the geographically-diverse reference sites in comparison to Crowsnest Lake. While the authors report Se concentrations in fish tissue, key details on analytical methods, quality control, and lab accreditation are not provided in the article. Without such information, confidence in the analytical results is difficult to evaluate fully. This is especially important in the case of Se, due to its low environmental concentrations and the complexity of accurately measuring low concentrations. As suggested, and given the significant implications of these data, independent verification or confirmation through expert review is highly recommended. It should be noted that the article comprises a couple of important inaccuracies, specifically: •	the article refers to a CCME sediment Se guideline of 2 µg/g, which does not exist; Canada has not adopted sediment guidelines for Se. Additionally, the cited whole-body fish tissue guideline of 6.7 µg/g appears to be based on the ECCC Federal Environmental Quality Guideline (FEQG), and is not a CCME guideline. The FEQG applies specifically to egg/ovary Se (14.7 µg/g) and muscle Se only as a screening value. Mis-stating the origin and intent of these values is a significant error that undermines the scientific rigor of the article; and, •	the article cites the 93% decline in Westslope Cutthroat Trout in the Fording River, but fail to cite the detailed, peer-reviewed Investigation of Cause (IOC) study, which attributed the decline to climatic conditions and not selenium toxicity. •	the article incorrectly implies that a $60 million fine was due to this decline. That fine, in fact, stemmed from broader non-compliance issues from 2012 – long before that decline occurred - and not a direct attribution to the population drop. Summary While it is understandable that elevated Se in fish tissue relative to low water concentrations raises a concern, the information provided in this paper fails to establish causality, provide historical or trophic context, or rigorously support its conclusions. The speculative connections to Tent Mountain, Whirling Disease, and catastrophic ecological effects are not supported by specific and relevant evidence. Misuse of terminology, misattribution of guideline values, and emotionally-charged language further erodes its credibility. A study of this type initially requires the clear identification and articulation of key research hypotheses (e.g., “is the elevated Se in fish tissue mine-related?”; “how is Se cycled in Crowsnest Lake”), and then determine what data/information are required to address those hypotheses. A multi-disciplinary, scientifically-defensible approach integrating fish movement, food web monitoring, sediment and water Se speciation, and reproductive success metrics, is essential to developing and reporting on scientifically-defensible conclusions.",2025-07-03T00:51:23,,GUY GILRON,,,,

Specifically, the team utilizes transmission mode MALDI followed by cold plasma ionization source (SICRIT) with analytes then being analyzed in a timsTOF Pro. The work was able to achieve subcellular MSI which they  showed across a variety of tissues and cells to highlight their application. Furthermore, they fortuitously discovered that pre-staining with cresyl violet enhanced ionization of nucleotides and helped facilitate subcellular imaging. Overall this paper provided excellent figures with exciting data, was highly rigorous in the reporting of the lipid species and nomenclature used, and with the instrumental design and assessment of the staining impact on the resulting images. We also enjoyed that this could provide staining and MSI on the same tissue rather than having to take serial sections; this is a really exciting aspect of this work. Below please find critiques for the authors considerations. 1. The comparison between pre and post CV staining was striking. Perhaps a little more discussion here could be helpful, it seems like in addition to the sample preparation creating the cavitations, do the authors posit that CV itself might be acting as a matrix as well to help facilitate ionization? Would other stains have a similar effect? 2. Our understanding of this instrument is that this is still fundamentally MALDI-2 like, in that the SICRIT is acting as a secondary ionization source, can the authors perhaps confirm this or make it more clear in the writing, that both neutral and ions are created during the transmission mode and further ions are created by the SICRIT. If this is not what is happening, then perhaps the writing could be adjusted. 3. For all MSI figures, it would be helpful to include the SMART ( https://doi.org/10.1002/jms.4904) reporting standards in the figures both main text and SI are encouraged to increase the transparency of the experiments. One thing we discussed was the time these experiments might take for the areas and the spatial resolutions achieved. 4. One thing that was unclear, is the intersection of how the cold plasma vs the more traditional MALDI-2 would drive the specifics for ionization of the nucleotides and lipids. Specifically could the CV be compatible with normal MALDI-2? We appreciate that the same spatial resolutions would not be achieved but it would be interesting to really isolate how the different changes really impact the subsequent detection of analytes to better understand how to optimize the system or pick the system for different biomolecules in the future. 5. Figure 4D doesn’t seem to help aid in the excitement of this methodology, specifically the microscopy doesn’t match the ion images. Or did the authors expect that only one cell line would be different compared to the other three? Could they better comment on some of the biology maybe if this what they expected?Figure 4C. Was the point to demonstrate colocalization of the dyes with the lipids? It could be helpful to highlight why the data might be meaningful and address the outstanding biological challenges. Figure4 B, C, D weren’t in order for increasing spatial resolution. 6. Can the authors comment on why only positive mode was done for the lipid analysis? Can this set up do negative mode? It might be helpful to comment on to better understand the rationale. 7. Why was 6 ppm vs 5 ppm for the lipid annotations? Typically for Organic Chemistry or Natural Products we utilize 5 ppm for HRMS. 8. Figure 3 this is very cool - is this known that Adenosine has a punctate pattern? The significance of the findings was not discussed, if this is a new biological observation that would be helpful to highlight this more so that the importance of subcellular metabolomics is really needed. Highlighting the significance of the findings would help bolster the future applications.",2025-07-01T20:31:41,disqus_nXqTRGyBsq,Laura Sanchez,,,,

We commend this work for establishing three key advances: The authors conclusively demonstrate that MIA-induced Treg deficiency and epigenetic dysregulation—drives ASD-like phenotypes. Crucially, adoptive transfer of healthy Tregs postnatally rescues social deficits and repetitive behaviors in offspring. This aligns with our previous findings that MIA offspring exhibit peripheral Th1/Th17 skewing (Zhipeng Xu et al. Nat Neurosci 2021), but extends the paradigm by proving offspring Tregs are autonomous therapeutic targets. The identification of sustained Foxp3 demethylation in offspring Tregs reveals a transgenerational immune imprinting mechanism. This explains the longevity of neurodevelopmental deficits and offers a postnatal intervention window—complementing our prenatal maternal Treg-focused strategy (Chunxiang Shen et al. Cell Rep 2024). While our previous work showed MIA disrupts placental Treg/ macrophage balance (via SR-A-dependent Sjp90α intervention), this preprint demonstrates how placental inflammation permanently programs offspring immunity. The data bridge in utero insults to postnatal neuropathology, forming a neuroimmunological continuum. This work redefines ASD as a neuroimmunological continuum spanning generations. By validating offspring Treg deficiency as a central pathological mechanism, it expands therapeutic opportunities beyond prenatal windows. We advocate integrated maternal-offspring strategies to disrupt this intergenerational cycle.",2025-07-01T15:19:27,disqus_U7b1J5Bi3a,徐志鹏(zhipengxu),,,,

No problems with p values, they seem robust. Effect size seems to be 54% (mean number of 'correct' human responses). I support reporting of intuitively intelligible effect sizes, and this seems like a pretty useful one to report. Then other readers can make up their own mind about whether this confirms ""Darwin’s century-old hunch about the conservation of aesthetics and beauty in nature"". Still, great study!
