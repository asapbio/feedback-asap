https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.30.702957v1#comment-6834388317,biorxivstage,2,"Thank you for taking time to read our manuscript. We would like to respond your comments here. 1.	We already showed in 2013 that Abs induce persistence by converting the whole population into persister cells without inducing death by pre-treating with rifampicin, tet, and CCCP (doi:10.1128/AAC.02135-12) so please add this to your paper. We vetted these persister cells 9 ways to show they are true persisters in later publication. This method has been used by over 60 groups to date in the persister field. Response: Thanks for pointing out. We totally agree that bacteriostatic antibiotics and drugs, by definition, can convert most of a bacterial population into persister cells without inducing death. Therefore, in this study we focus on bactericidal antibiotics, mostly used in time-kill assays, to examine and quantify persisters induced by lethal stresses. Broadly, your work agrees with our proposed drug-induced persistence spectrum (DIPS) model and a more general stress-induced-persistence-spectrum model. Your work will acknowledged in the Discussion. 2.	We were the first to show, using single cells, in 2018 (doi:10.1111/1462-2920.14093) that persister cells wake in minutes. Please update your line 85 text which is false as, we have shown and other groups corroborated, nearly all persister cells resuscitate within minutes of being introduced into fresh medium so they wake and multiply at the same growth rate of exponentially-growing cells within seconds. Response: Thank you for this clarification. We agree that most persister cells, once they wake, rapidly resume normal growth and proliferate at rates comparable to susceptible cells. Only a minority remain in a dormant state and constitute the pre-existing persisters, which are the persisters referred to in this context (line 85). We would like to clarify that “persister replication” in line 85 refers specifically to the rare events in which a persister cell divides to produce two persister cells, rather than to persister resuscitation and growth. We believe such events are rare and negligible relative to the contribution of pre-existing persisters. 3.	There is no credible evidence for ‘spontaneous’ persisters, only sloppy carryover from the inoculum. Response: Thank you for this comment. We agree that the vast majority of persisters, found in exponential-phase culture, originate from stationary-phase inocula and that carryover can contribute substantially to observed persister populations (when seed dilution factors are low, e.g, 100x). At the same time, we note that the existence of truly spontaneous persisters remains a theoretical possibility and has been suggested by several single-cell studies, although this remains a subject of debate. Such spontaneous persisters could arise from stochastic fluctuations or rare glitches in transcription, translation, metabolism, and/or asymmetric allocation during cell division, leading to unusual levels of ppGpp, toxins, or other effector proteins in a small subset of cells. If such events occur, we expect them to occur at extremely low frequencies. 4. Please replace your ref 23 single cell work of Van Melderen as the first single cell work.  the same conclusions was https://doi.org/10.1016/ j.isci.2019.100792 and doi:10.1111/1462-2920.14093.

The authors undertook a variety of different experiments, which was impressive, but also may have lessened the quality of their research. While much of the science appeared to be quite convincing, a closer look reveals some inconsistencies between stated findings and figures. I noticed many typos within the legends on the figures, and differences in the experimental process described in words versus the experimental process reflected by figures. Some things to take note of: in Figure 1, procedures are not clear; when were the measurements taken? Was the glucose checked in the mice? What is the ""endpoint"" for the experiment, and why does it change from experiment to experiment? Did the mice die or were they sacrificed? Survival curves would also have been appreciated. Furthermore, i believe it would benefit the research to have conducted studies on male and female mice for all conditions, to test for any changes between sex. In Figure 2, I noticed that different cancer cell lines were utilized in the experimental process, but no explanation was given for why this was the case. In Figure 3, many of the colors and shapes do not match across panels, which makes it difficult to track the data (ex. for E.coli). Similar to above, the data in Figure 3F does not match the analysis given in the ""results"" section. Figure 4 and 5 featured a bubble plot, which presented very informative data, however the paper seemed to focus on aspects of the heat map that were not necessarily proven by the data. For example, the passage states: “This analysis revealed a prominent activation of the tryptophan metabolic pathway in the MedDiet group” (260), but this is not necessarily proven by figure 4; the data shows that there seems to be other metabolic pathways that are upregulated by the MedDiet group than the Tryptophan metabolic pathway. It might be worth considering addressing this issue, to avoid introducing any accidental bias into the findings. Some other issues that were noticed: it was assumed that the reader had context for this study, but many readers may be coming in to read this paper with no background on the MedDiet. Many acronyms were used without providing appropriate definitions which made it difficult to follow the paper. It seemed as though the paper jumped to many conclusions without providing an accurate backing or ""proof"". Much of the statistical analyses used in this paper also seemed to be inconsistent. Some things that can be appreciated about this paper: the authors covered a lot of bases and tried to include many sample groups (different diets, cancer lines, mice sexes, etc.). I appreciate that they tested for reproducibility, at least at the beginning. They also tried to investigate the mechanism of the MedDiet, not just general effects. They also used a variety of different techniques to evaluate their hypothesis: flow cytometry, genomic sequencing, immunohistochemistry, etc. All things considered, this was a huge undertaking. I am sure that with further review, this could become quite beneficial for the scientific community.

We vetted these persister cells 9 ways to show they are true persisters in later publication. This method has been used by over 60 groups to date in the persister field. 2.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has achieved substantial success in hematological malignancies but remains largely ineffective in solid tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this preprint, the authors address this important challenge by examining how obesity alters the tumor microenvironment (TME) to limit CAR-T cell efficacy, with a focus on the inhibitory checkpoint molecule B7-H3. The experimental rationale is well-conceived, and the development of a CAR-T platform targeting a checkpoint pathway relevant to TNBC is innovative and timely. The study provides valuable insight into the interaction between host metabolic state and immunotherapy outcomes. However, some aspects of the experimental design, data analysis, and interpretation require further clarification to strengthen the study's impact and significance. A major assumption in Figure 1 is that obesity-associated inflammatory cytokines promote B7-H3 expression in TNBC. Based on this, the authors focus primarily on IFN-γ and TNF as mediators of this effect. While both cytokines are established regulators of immune checkpoint pathways, it is unclear whether their selection was informed by preliminary data demonstrating their elevation in the obesity-associated TNBC models used here. Obesity is a complex inflammatory milieu that includes not only pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory mediators such as IL-10 and TGF-β, which have also been implicated in immune suppression and checkpoint regulation within the TME. Background cytokine profiling or broader screening should be conducted to provide a strong justification for choosing specific cytokines. The experimental design presented in Figure 2 includes four biologically distinct groups: lean control and obese mice bearing either scramble or B7-H3–knockdown E0771 tumors. However, the analytical approach used relied on splitting these groups and performing multiple Student’s t-tests. A direct comparison across all groups using a one- or two-way ANOVA, as appropriate, is more statistically rigorous and better suited for this setting. The authors report differences in immune cell frequencies within the TME, which represents an important strength of the study. However, total frequencies were presented without gating strategies or phenotypic characterization. Assessment of tumor immune infiltration requires more detailed profiling because immune cell activation, exhaustion, or functionality can differ substantially even with similar total frequency. Including gating schematics and markers defining functional states would improve data interpretation and provide a better understanding of how obesity reshapes the immune landscape in TNBC. The authors did not assess changes in B7-H3 expression during tumor progression. Kinetic analysis of B7-H3 expression would help understand constitutive expression and changes driven by tumor growth, immune infiltration, or obesity. Such information could clarify whether obesity accelerates checkpoint upregulation during tumor progression. CAR-T cell cytotoxicity was inferred primarily from cytokine production (IL-2 and IFN-γ). Although these cytokines reflect T cell activation, they do not directly measure cytolytic activity. Degranulation assays assessing granzyme B, perforin, and CD107a expression would provide a direct and widely accepted measure of T cell cytotoxicity. An inconsistency is noted in the reported age of mice used in Figure 6. The text describes animals aged 25–30 weeks, but the schematic indicates 15 weeks. The strong influence of age on immune function and metabolic status necessitates consistency in animal age. This discrepancy should be corrected, and age should be clearly reported across all experiments. An interesting observation is that CAR-T cells generated from younger mice were able to reject tumors in both lean and obese hosts. In contrast, CAR-T cells from older mice failed to suppress tumor growth in DIO mice. This finding suggests an age-dependent decline in CAR-T cell functionality. However, this aspect is not fully explored. Additional discussion or mechanistic investigation of how donor age influences CAR-T fitness would substantially enhance the study's impact. Finally, the memory and recall experiments in Figure 7 raise important questions regarding differential survival after tumor rechallenge. The authors should report CAR-T cell persistence levels in lean and obese mice prior to rechallenge and provide tumor growth kinetics following rechallenge. Clarifying whether differences in survival are driven by primary tumor burden, metastatic dissemination, or immune memory failure would strengthen the interpretation of these results. Overall, this study addresses a timely and important question at the intersection of obesity, immune checkpoints, and CAR-T therapy in TNBC. The experimental rationale is strong, and the focus on B7-H3 as a mediator of immunotherapy resistance is well justified. Addressing the points outlined above would further strengthen the rigor, clarity, and translational relevance of the work. Also, this will help define how host metabolic state, age, and immune regulation collectively shape CAR-T efficacy in solid tumors.",2026-01-26T23:37:54,,Oladapo,10.1101/2025.10.10.681694,Obesity Impairs the Antitumor Activity of CAR-T Cells in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Hannah M.

Using variable concentrations of nocodazole to stabilise (low) or destabilise (high) MTs allows precise temporal control of spindle density/dynamics. However, it's a global change to the MTs and it's not clear what relative effect the Noc has on interpolar, kinetochore, centrosomal and augmin-mediated MTs. It would be interesting to know if these distinct populations are affected differentially and therefore what can be said about the relative contributions to spindle-chromosome rheology. In our previous work in Drosophila embryos (Hayward et la., Dev Cell 2014), we used an anti-Dgt6 antibody to specifically inactivate Augmin upon entry into mitosis (Augmin recruits the MT nucleator, g-TuRC to pre-existing spindle MTs increasing the overall density of the spindle ~2-fold). Augmin inhibition results in the dramatic loss of short spindle MTs, a reduction in spindle density and increase in pole-to-pole distance. Something we noted was that chromosome movement (as well as congression) was affected. Additionally, using a Rod-GFP fly line in the presence of Augmin inhibition, we saw all sorts of abnormal Rod-GFP movements along the kinetochore MTs that remained, suggesting something wrong with the forces between the kMT and the kinetochores. I think we talked a bit about this in the discussion - suggesting the abnormal congression was due to the rheology of the overall spindle being compromised by loss of the Augmin-generated (non-kinetochore) mass of short MTs.",2026-01-21T09:19:45,wakefieldjames,"Wakefield, James",10.64898/2026.01.17.700110,Coordinated chromosome motion emerges from mechanical coupling mediated by the physical spindle environment,"Jiali Zhu, Kerry Bloom, Ehssan Nazockdast, Paul Maddox",2026-01-20

Here are our highlights: Authors propose a ""theory-to-practice"" bridge for phylogeny: take a mathematically defined ""forest"" algorithm (that most biologists have never used) and then test it under simulation settings chosen to look biologically reasonable (Jukes-Cantor, short branches). The work deliberately departs from the standard paradigm of ""always returning a fully resolved tree"". The algorithm is optimized to avoid false splits and is allowed to output partial structures or abstain entirely. This places the method firmly in a precision-first regime rather than traditional phylogenetic benchmarking. The main onservation: the value of forest methods lies in explicitly identifying which parts of the data are informative and in providing downstream analyses with a more faithful representation of uncertainty. While the current approach outperforms NJ only in narrow regimes, the conceptual shift toward partial, conservative outputs (especially hybrid workflows that combine forests with standard tree-building methods) appears promising. The paper data are generated under a simple but biologically valid model, and the authors release the complete pipeline for data generation and experimentation.

PET is widely used in packaging and textiles and persists in the environment as macro- and microplastics, posing environmental and health concerns. While PET-degrading enzymes have been studied extensively in vitro, practical whole-cell microbial solutions for environmental PET degradation have remained limited. The authors isolated a strain of Pseudomonas umsongensis that can metabolize terephthalate, a key monomer released from PET hydrolysis. To enable direct PET degradation, the strain was genetically engineered to secrete the high-activity PET hydrolase PHL7 using a recombinant twin-arginine translocation (TAT) secretion signal. This allowed extracellular degradation of PET into assimilable products. Additionally, PET was pre-treated with an organic solvent to create an amorphous and macroporous structure, significantly improving enzyme accessibility and bioavailability. The study demonstrates that the engineered bacterium can grow using PET-derived carbon, providing evidence of true microbial consumption rather than simple enzymatic breakdown. This represents an important advancement toward sustainable plastic upcycling and bioremediation approaches that could operate outside controlled laboratory conditions. However, the work remains a preprint and has not yet undergone peer review, so conclusions should be considered preliminary. The requirement for PET pre-treatment and the existence of a related patent may also influence scalability and environmental application. Despite these limitations, the study offers a valuable proof of concept for whole-cell microbial systems in plastic waste management and highlights a promising direction for future research.",2026-01-20T03:06:42,,Nosheen,10.1101/2024.09.24.614569,Degradation of PET plastic with engineered environmental bacteria,"Alice M.

With these longer experiments where the mice are exposed to a multitude of agents (tumor cells, CAR-T cells, and more tumor cells), were the DIO mice still significantly more obese than the low-fat diet mice throughout the roughly 20 weeks? It should also be reported whether or not the mice were kept on their high-fat or low-fat diet throughout these experiments. It would be helpful to report endpoint tumor mass or tumor volume after rechallenge. It is not explained why the timepoint of 72 hours post rechallenge was chosen, is there a reason for this?",2026-01-19T17:45:59,jncbge,Jncbge,10.1101/2025.10.10.681694,Obesity Impairs the Antitumor Activity of CAR-T Cells in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Hannah M.

It would suggest that there is not an inherent deficiency in CAR-T cell function, at least initially, based on diet despite the earlier finding in Figure 4 that the different CAR-T cells exhibit differences in exhaustion. In Figure 6B, it would be more informative to include nontransduced control on same graph or at least match the axis values to figure 6D. Why was the study in figure 4D stopped at 15 days when it is shown in figure 6B that tumor growth continues despite injections even in healthy mice? I’m not sure it can ultimately be concluded that these results indicate changes in the TME. I think that more analysis would need to be done as all these figures indicate is that DIO mice appear worse at controlling tumor volume. Additionally, it doesn’t say anything about T cell function either as regardless of T cell donor, the tumors are shown to have reduced volume. I think that this is an overstatement of what the results are showing.",2026-01-19T17:44:47,jncbge,Jncbge,10.1101/2025.10.10.681694,Obesity Impairs the Antitumor Activity of CAR-T Cells in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Hannah M.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681694v1#comment-6825889888,biorxivstage,0,"Figure 2 It is not clear to me how simply suppressing the expression of B7H3 in tumors would lead to a reduction in tumor size. This would suggest that you don’t even need CAR-T cells to reduce tumor burden in obese patients. What are your thoughts on this? In Figure 2E-L, The graphs should be combined to show all 4 experimental groups on one graph (scramble E0771 administered to control mice, shB7H3 E0771 administered to control mice, scramble E0771 administered to DIO mice, and shB7H3 E0771 administered to DIO mice) and statistical analysis should be performed across all 4 groups (with an ANOVA).  As an example, 2E should be combined with 2I. In figure 2M, comparing these 2 groups is not informative in terms of assessing the transcriptomic changes that occur when B7-H3 suppressed tumor cells are administered to lean vs obese mice.  The comparison between control mice that received tumor cells that were not B7-H3 suppressed vs DIO mice that received B7-H3 suppressed tumor cells is not entirely useful unless the other two groups are presented. The data presented do not adequately support the claim that suppressing B7-H3 in obesity helps restore immune function, especially without seeing the transcriptomic changes that occur in control mice given B7-H3 suppressed tumor cells. Additionally, from a graphic design perspective it is difficult to interpret this figure without some way to indicate differences in circle size aside from just hoping the reader will observe it.",2026-01-19T17:44:22,jncbge,Jncbge,10.1101/2025.10.10.681694,Obesity Impairs the Antitumor Activity of CAR-T Cells in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Hannah M.

They then decide to investigate IFNy and TNF as “obesity derived inflammatory cues” which could impact B7-H3 expression. I am unsure about why these two cytokines were chosen specifically. It may be helpful for readers to outline the choice of cytokines here more. In the supplemental figures for figure 1, you observe no significant difference in B7-H3 relative expression when using TNF and IFNy for either human cancer cell line. I would think that if there is no significant difference when both cytokines are present in your assay, in vivo this may not affect B7-H3 expression when both cytokines would be elevated.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681694v1#comment-6825889354,biorxivstage,2,"Hello, Your pre-print was recently shared in a journal club at our school. Some of the graduate students thought it might be a good exercise to practice writing feedback and questions about your paper. Please find below some of the comments we came up with. Overall thoughts The title seems to overstate what is actually found in the paper. In a mouse model, you observed that CAR-T cells specific for B7-H3 were found to reduce tumor volume in a murine E0771 model. Furthermore, the analysis you did in figure 4 revealed that there appeared to be differences in exhaustion phenotype and glycolytic activity, but not in cytolytic killing or cytokine secretion. In figure 6, it is further shown that non transduced DIO mice display a tumor volume on average of 600 mm3 by 15 days, whereas when DIO mice are given CAR-T cells from a DIO donor, the average tumor volume is around 325 mm3 by 25 days. This would suggest that the CAR-T cells are still working in the obese mice. Perhaps something else is contributing to the change in volume. Regarding DIO mice, have they developed poor glycemic control at the time of the experiments?  Further, would performing experiments when the mice have been on high-fat diets for different lengths of time (eg. 15 weeks of HFD vs 18 weeks of HFD vs 25 weeks of HFD) affect glycemic control?  Without performing a glucose tolerance test, for example, it is not possible to rule out glycemic control as a possible confounding variable and attribute the phenotypes noted to obesity alone. The timepoints should be consistent across experiments of the same type.  As an example, in Figure 2, body mass is reported from day 0 - day 18, but tumor volume is reported from day 0 - day 21.  Although it is unlikely that any significant change in body mass occurred in days 18 - 21, there is no way to know without reporting it. This is more relevant when looking at figure 6B and 6D.  In figure 6B, the last timepoint was after 20 days, whereas in figure 6D, 15 days was the latest timepoint.",2026-01-19T17:43:14,jncbge,Jncbge,10.1101/2025.10.10.681694,Obesity Impairs the Antitumor Activity of CAR-T Cells in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Hannah M.
