Review of Paunov et al. https://www.biorxiv.org/con... The authors identify that the study of language and theory of mind (ToM) processing has been conducted, for the most part, independently in laboratory settings, leaving questions for dependencies between these systems in more naturalistic settings. They ask: do language and ToM neural networks dissociate even in response to naturalistic stimuli, which have varying levels of ToM and language content? General evaluation: Key strengths of this paper are: 1) the use of naturalistic stimuli that are rich with theory of mind and language content to study the functional dissociation between ToM-Language networks, and 2) the methodology – a combination of individual-specific functional localization and inter-subject correlation (ISC) – that minimizes reverse and non-specific inference based on anatomical locations only. Inclusion of resting state ISC to ensure that the task-based ISC are not the result of data acquisition, preprocessing, or modeling procedures add to their interpretation of results. That said, 1) nuanced discussions of conflicting key data in the context of their paradigms, and 2) additional whole-brain level ISC analyses given the limitations of using ISC in inferring dissociability of ToM and language networks could substantially increase the value of this paper to the field. Major comments: 1.	Please further qualify the interpretations of “functional dissociability” between language and ToM networks in the context of the posed question and used paradigm. A major conclusion from the experiment is that there was indeed dissociability between language and ToM neural networks, albeit incomplete, even under naturalistic stimuli rich with social contexts. However, as the authors reviewed thoroughly in the introduction and Figure 1, cognitive demands on ToM processing may come from heterogenous contexts, i.e. mental state inference and mental state content comprehension. Since their objective was to evaluate differential recruitment of language-ToM networks in processing the latter, and the ToM localizer task they used specified regions involved in comprehension of mental state content that are linguistically presented (Figure 2), their main ToM neural results supporting network dissociation need to be interpreted from that methodology. For example, can you use the ToM activity in condition “-Language +ToM” (where regions were selected by language-based ToM localizer task) as evidence for mental state content comprehension, when the stimuli themselves were presented non-linguistically? It could have instead represented the process of mental state inference, which is not what the authors aimed to measure. How do you interpret left TPJ, which exhibits weak but significantly above-baseline tracking of the expository text (“+Language -ToM”); could it be that the participants were inferring what these expository words mean using higher order processes, and that ISC is measuring this common internal process, even though there is no ToM content to track (the original purpose of this task)? Even though the authors discuss generally that naturalistic stimuli such as those used in this paradigm may require fundamentally increased combination of ToM and language network interaction as well as heterogenous ToM context processing (inference/comprehension), qualifying interpretations of currently conflicting neural data by returning to their originally stated research goal will add concrete insights into the nature of “functional dissociability” under real-life conditions. 2.	Please provide results in the control regions that are not supposed to be involved in language or ToM across the modalities of stimuli presentation. Ideally, authors can also provide whole-brain maps of ISC during the tasks, as these would provide a more comprehensive picture of inter-network differences and similarities underlying critical ISC results, which are currently grounds for supporting ToM-language dissociation. As the authors acknowledge in Line 851-855 and 947-948, ISC can be driven by anything that is consistent across participants at the time of doing the tasks, not necessarily reflecting language or ToM-related processing (Nastase et al., SCAN 2019). For example, the ToM network overlaps with the default mode network, which becomes more active when participants are reflecting and directing attention internally. The stimuli may have had varying levels of engagingness and subjectively meaningful processing. In other words, with the current datasets we don’t really know if the domains that the authors were interested in drove ISC. By contrast, some regions that are more idiosyncratic (e.g. less stimulus driven) could have been crucially involved in processing ToM content, perhaps suggesting that lower ISC (e.g. RH PCC/precuneus in dialog condition) in fact was a false negative in that ROI. 3.	Signal-to-noise-ratio may be stronger in certain ROIs than others, leading to differences in ISC. Please provide some correction or normalization of this to qualify the validity of the results comparing ROIs. Minor comments: 4.	If they have this information, in 2.3 Participants, another exclusionary criterion should be impairment of ToM or language network either from neurological or psychiatric conditions. 5.	Authors found in reality check #1 experiment that these individuals’ auditory and visual cortex activity were also not completely dissociated and crossed over to track visual and auditory stimuli, respectively during active task performance. I would like to hear the interpretations of these results with regard to the main results. 6.	Authors conducted multiple demand network analysis as part of the replication analysis – please (if it does) explain how this adds to their conclusion/results of this paper. 7.	In Line 1043, be more specific how methodology enhanced with temporal resolutions (MEG, intracranial recording) could be better for investigating mechanism of ToM-language network interaction?",2021-12-23T21:29:42,,Anonymous Peer Reviewer,10.1101/2021.04.28.441724,Differential tracking of linguistic vs. mental state content in naturalistic stimuli by language and Theory of Mind (ToM) brain networks,"Alexander M.

I do have some concerns about the sensitivity/specificity values stated in the paper, though - and their implications for the evidential weight provided by the models you test. The true-positive, false-negative etc numbers making up the 2x2 contingency tables are pretty small, making normality assumptions unreliable. Best practice in such cases is to use Wilson's method (see eg Altman et al 2000 ""Statistics with confidence"" Ch 10). This  leads to point estimates and upper/lower 95% intervals for the sensitivity somewhat different than those in Table 5a/b. My principal concern, though, is about the specificity, which is stated to be 100%. Given that your study is based on a (small) sample, one really should reflect the uncertainty surrounding the values. Applying Wilson's method leads to typical point estimates for the specificity of around 72%. The upper bound is 100%, but the lower bound is typically around 44%. Combined with the sensitivity data, this suggest the positive Likelihood Ratio for the various models to be around 2 or so - somewhat less than the infinite value implied by taking the specificity to be 100%, as stated in the table! Given the importance of the sensitivity/specificity calculations for this type of work, perhaps you could have another look at the values in Table 5a/b. Looking forward to seeing how the paper progresses!

General Remarks Overall, all of us enjoyed reading the manuscript. The writing was excellent and it inspired some interesting discussions among us. We definitely want to see this paper published in some form! At times we had the idea that this could also be a technical note focusing on the methodological challenges. Additional: •	Comprehensive Introduction (however, it reads more like a review, some found it too lengthy) •	Very nice figures •	Great points in the discussion (e.g., object permanence in real world vs. lab experiments) Major Issues Our main issue was with the tablet condition. First, you argue to employ a scalable experimental design. But why only choose the two extremes ends of the spectrum and not use some middle ground? Maybe a more controlled tablet condition where participants also scroll and search for books? Second, the tablet condition was in general not a good control for us. Why did you not use a more comparable visual search task in the tablet condition? •	Are you really sure that some of the problems are not simply due to technical issues? Some more information/evidence on how you conducted e.g. timing tests could be relevant •	Section 3.5.2 on ERP latency does not make sense to us, this latency is manufactured and hence arbitrary. •	We do not understand 4C properly. What do we see here? A more detailed explanation is necessary. •	Why manual labeling of fixations (should be better explained)? Could this be automatized? •	Removing more than 40% of the ICA component seem excessive. It was unclear to us whether those are only eye and heart rate related components ? •	We expect that people titled their head left and right to read the titles on the back of the book. Did this have an effect on the EEG quality, to you have information about head movements? •	As far as we understand you have eye tracking information for both task. To us it seems logical to apply the same analysis pipeline you used for the library task for the tablet condition as well (i.e. define gaze fixations and epoch according to these, also you can apply the template matching approach to the tablet condition to see how this changes the data.) •	We believe that a visual search task would be the better control condition. In general the entire visual search literature seems to be very relevant here but is not extensively discussed. Minor Issues •	In the pre-processing, you state that you use 300ms to 500ms to quantify the P3. However, anywhere else in the MS you highlight the window from 250ms to 500ms. •	What is the height of the people? - “eye-level” - some participants are taller than others - was that controlled for somehow? (not sure whether this is relevant but it might be.) •	How was the library prepared? Was it closed off the other people? Did you make sure the target books were always there? •	Re-referencing: Did you re-reference the data or simply remove the mastoids? It was unclear to us the way it is written. •	Scanlon et al. (2017) is a paper about comparing an oddball task between sitting and pedalling on a stationary bike inside. It seems like you meant to cite: •	Scanlon, J. E., Townsend, K. A., Cormier, D.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.12.443801v1#comment-5653922412,biorxivstage,3,"The manuscript by Nies et al. demonstrates how changing pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) parameters can affect non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and photosystem II yield (ՓPSII). Using in silico simulations of PAM experiments, the authors illustrate how NPQ and ՓPSII are affected by varying: i) the delay between measurement of maximal fluorescence Fm and the onset of the actinic light (or between turning off AL and measurement of Fm’’ in the dark), ii) the intensity of the actinic light, iii) the frequency of the saturating pulses, iv) and their duration. Nies et al. finish by validating their in silico model, and suggesting that scientists using PAM must provide the details of all of the parameters listed above in the methods section of any publications to allow their experiments to be accurately reproduced and modeled. We enjoyed this manuscript, however, we have some comments and suggestions for improvement, listed below. Major comments - We suggest moving part of the model validation section of the results, shown in Figures 8 (and 9), to the start of the manuscript. This rearrangement would show the reader that the mathematical model used in the in silico simulations can accurately reproduce experimental data, before the parameter-dependent changes to NPQ and ՓPSII are simulated. In the current arrangement, the reader needs to have prior knowledge that the changes in NPQ and ՓPSII shown in the simulations are accurate, before the herein updated model has been validated. - Fig8. Regarding the validation of the mathematical model by comparing to experimental PAM measurements with different SP durations, or different delays of AL onset from Fm measurement, with the simulated data: what is the rationale for choosing these, how about testing the other parameters such as AL intensity and frequency of SP? Please comment on the impact of the different parameters on e.g. the NPQ measurement and rank them by stronger to lower effect based on your simulations and experiments. Also a historical perspective/physiological relevance of delaying the SP from actinic onset would be welcome! How about giving recommendation to researchers in the field to have Fm determination/SP right at onset of illumination, with no delay, to prevent further confusion (and similarly have the final SP in AL on, followed by AL off with no delay). - Line 326. Regarding the use of another model of photosynthesis, we found this very interesting and suggest that a comparison of the simulations generated by the two mathematical models using the same set of parameters be included as a main or supplemental figure, and its description be included in the results section. The GitLab link (line 330) doesn’t specify which exact file to look at. - Line 127. “We have used 500 µmol s−1 m−2 as the default light intensity of AL.” For simulations, an intensity of 500 µmol m−2 s−1 was used, but for experiments (line 152) “The intensity of red AL was set at approx. 457 µmol m−2 s−1”. We understand that matching the actinic light during the experiment to 500 µmol m−2s−1 cannot be possible, alternatively we suggest that the simulations be carried out at 457 µmol m−2 s−1 for sake of consistency. Importantly, is 457 µmol m−2 s−1 the value given by the manufacturer for the chosen setting, and did you measure it to confirm its value? (depending on instrument calibration, usage and age, the light output can be different than set) - Line 204, 205. “The calculated steady-state NPQ values are higher for SP intensities below 3000 µmol s−1 m−2”, according to Fig.5, it seems that the threshold is rather 2000, than 3000 (or 4000). - Fig7. To test the “actinic effect” of SP duration, we would suggest to perform a simulation with AL=100 µmol m−2 s−1 AL and/or AL=0 to check whether SP themselves can induce NPQ. According to Fig8A (experimental), it seems that at 0.8s, NPQ is indeed slightly higher than with shorter SP duration. - Line 370, a necessary addition would be to list here, or write a template of, what you suggest for minimum information is needed as standard for the community. It could be similar to Table 2, and needs to include duration of AL on, off and AL quality. Minor comments - Line 46. “Allow”, should be “allows” - Line 75. “Groups but also” should be “groups experimentally, but also” - Line 115. Replace higher by vascular. - Line 140. 26C is higher than standard temperature for Arabidopsis growth (22C), what’s the rationale for choosing this temperature? - Line 150. Define Fv and explain if the 5s of far red light is turned on at the very beginning of the experiment i.e. before time 0. - Line 153. “default settings (10)”, specify “set at value of” 10. We suggest writing a small table with these parameters (see major comment). - Line 161. Which leaf did you choose, younger or older? This information is important to state, see differences with leaf age for example in Bielczynski et al. Plant Phys (2017) doi: 10.1104/pp.17.00904. - Line 173-174. We suggest that the SP time points are moved to the methods section. - Line 185-186. “In the upper panel….derived NPQ and ՓPSII”, this whole sentence can be removed as it should be clear from the figure legend. - Line 211. “Far more” how many did you look at? - Fig. 6. “6A and 6A”. Should be “6A and 6B” - Line 234. “Switching on AL with the first SP in light-triggered after 1 s” suggest rewording as it was unclear what light-triggered means. - Line 241. The observed effect is likely due to the total conversion of zeaxanthin to violaxanthin for long periods of dark-adaptation. - Line 243. Suggest changing “whereas” should be “however” as it is clearer. - Line 256. Define PMST. - Line 264-268. We suggest moving this block of text to the discussion section. - Line 264. “AL is another important information” should be “AL is another important piece of information” - Fig. 8B and 8D. As the simulated curves seem to all overlap, and often in this study we look for fine nuances between data, we think it would be beneficial to read the simulated curve superimposed on top of the experimental data allowing a fair comparison and analysis between the two types of data. Displaying the same graphs at a larger scale would help to read them. To help in this, we propose Figure 8 to be divided in two figures, since Fig. 8A-D is related to “SP experiment” while Fig. 8E-H is related to the “delay experiment”. This would allow the size of the panels to be increased to help the reader interpret the data. - Fig. 8F and 8H. Plot titles “Delay NPQ/ՓPSII Sim lation”, should be “Delay NPQ/ՓPSII Simulation” - Fig. 9 seems to be redundant as the reader should be able to observe the difference between the two independent experiments by comparing Figure 8A and 8E. We therefore suggest that Fig. 9 be removed. - Line 286. “Measurements are” should be “measurements have been” - Line 289-303. We suggest moving this block of text to the introduction section - Line 324. Replace “many” by “all”! - Line 351. “Agreements” should be “agreement” - Line 361-372. We feel that the points made in this block of text have already been made earlier in the manuscript and repeated several times. Therefore this block of text can probably be omitted as it is redundant. - General comments concerning the figures: we suggest adding dark/light bars to the top of most plots in Figures 3B-C, 4B-C, 6A-D, 7A-B, 8A-H; as it would improve the readability/interpretation of the plotted data. Fig. 2-8, figure identifier letters are presented in a different font style than the rest of the text, throughout the document.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.20.461005v1#comment-5653195920,biorxivstage,2,"The manuscript by Swaffer et al. is a very interesting paper that demonstrates for the first time that the RNA pol II complex is the limiting factor for transcription rate of protein-coding genes. This is an important new finding that, although suspected by previous researchers, was not studied in any organism (to our knowledge). Another important result is the finding that about 50% of the RNA pol II molecules are bound to chromatin. This confirms previous studies made by different laboratories that found a significant part of the RNA pol II not to be actively transcribing (Struhl 2007; Borggrefe et al. 2001; discussed in Pelechano et al., 2010). The fact that not all (or most) RNA pol II molecules are not bound to chromatin, however, does not affect the models that assume that the strong affinity constant of this RNA pol for their targets is what causes an increase in the number of elongating RNA pol II. This increase will be reflected in nascent transcription rate (nTR, see Pérez-Ortín et al 2013 for a detailed discussion) with cell volume increase (Lin and Amir, 2018; Marguerat and Bahler, 2012; Padovan-Merhar et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2020; Zhurinsky et al., 2010; Mena et al., 2017). This is because if the binding depends on the general mass action equilibrium, as Swaffer et al. propose, the increase in nTR will still occur even with 50% of the RNA pol II molecules unbound to chromatin. The key reason is that the number of RNA pol II molecules per cell does not increase in proportion to cell volume, but less than that. This is another important result described in Swaffer et al.: RNA pol II concentration decreases with cell volume. This result, however, was already demonstrated four years ago by our group (Mena et al. 2017) although is not cited by Swaffer et al. The difference between our results and those of Swaffer et al. is that we found no increase at all in RNA pol II molecules per cell within the range of cell volumes studied, whereas Swaffer et al. found that there is an increase but less than required for scaling. That difference is striking because we demonstrated that nTR does not scales at all with cell size (Mena et al., 2017) in 5 different circumstances: two meta-analysis of published data from P. Cramer group; after α-factor release in synchronized cultures; by western blot of Ser2-phosphorylated Rpb1; and using a set of cell size mutants that include whi5 and cln3 similarly to those used by Swaffer et al. For our analyses we utilized data obtained with different techniques (cDTA, GRO, western blot) and different physiological situations of cell size change. The data from Swaffer et al. also come from various different experimental setups. We have no explanation for this discrepancy. However, the results from Swaffer et al. lack explanation for two important questions: the reason for the decrease in RNA pol II concentration and the ultimate reason for this apparently abnormal behavior of S. cerevisiae cells. In our publication (Mena et al. 2017) we answered those two questions. The decrease in RNA pol II concentration is due to a particular behavior of the mRNAs that encode for their main subunits (Rpb1,2,3). On the contrary to the rest of the transcriptome (see below) these mRNAs that maintain their nTR (as most of the others) do not suffer a compensatory stabilization: they are outside of the feedback mechanism argued by Swaffer et al. The global mRNA stabilization feedback mechanism was also demonstrated by us in our 2017 paper (Mena et al., 2017). This is again a satisfactory coincidence with Swaffer et al. results but was, again, not cited in their manuscript. Finally, but very importantly, the reason for the abnormal behavior of S. cerevisiae that seems to behave differently from other eukaryotes studied (Marguerat and Bahler, 2012; Padovan-Merhar et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2020; Zhurinsky et al., 2010) is that it is a budding yeast. That is, it divides asymmetrically. As we shown in our study (Mena et al, 2017) the models based in an increase in nTR with cell volume to keep the production of mRNAs (synthesis rate) constant  predict a never ending increasing mRNA synthesis rate in smaller daughter cells along the successive generations. This is a key conceptual problem. We developed a model (scenario #3 in Mena et al., 2017) that seems to be partially similar to the dynamic equilibrium model of Swaffer et al. in the sense that both assume that RNA pol II concentration decreases with cell volume. However, there is a very important difference between the two models. If the decrease in RNA pol II concentration were not strictly inverse to the cell size increase (i.e. constant nTR for RNA pol II-encoding genes) the conceptual problem would not be solved. Only a perfect maintenance of nascent transcription rates for RNA pol II-encoding genes would solve the asymmetric cell division problem. A corollary of this discussion is that perhaps the results of Swaffer et al. presented as a general model for eukaryote RNA polymerase II dynamics with cell size are only valid for budding yeasts given that the previous publications on the limiting factor model referred to symmetrically dividing cells.

We hope that they will find the following comments relevant. The impact on pain-like responses of the contextual paradigm described herein, whereby acetic acid is injected intraperitoneally and hind paw withdrawal responses are measured, is attributed to either ‘classical referred pain mechanisms (i.e., sensitization of spinal cord projection neurons receiving information from both the foot and the viscera), or to the recently described ‘anti-diffuse noxious inhibitory control (anti-DNIC)’ phenomenon in which pain in one region of the body increases pain in another anatomically distinct region’. We firstly note that these two explanations are incongruous; visceral inputs converge onto the same lumbosacral pathways as hindpaw cutaneous inputs and it is likely that the impact on pain-like responses observed is influenced by secondary hyperalgesia (itself is likely subjected to descending modulation, although this has not been investigated here). We secondly note that DNIC, since it’s description by Le Bars et al., is defined as a neurophysiological measure where two distant noxious stimuli recruit a distinct descending inhibitory pathway and supresses spinal neuronal excitability (i.e., it cannot be explained by intrasegmental mechanisms but is heterotopically/heterosegmentally recruited). Thus, not all descending modulation is DNIC. Indeed, the descending pain modulatory system (DPMS) encompasses multiple parallel yet distinct circuits (anatomically and pharmacologically speaking) including placebo analgesia, offset analgesia/onset hyperalgesia, attentional analgesia, stress-induced analgesia/hyperalgesia, DNIC and others. Therefore, we feel strongly that the contextual hypoalgesia or hyperalgesia that you observe upon application of your paradigm in wakeful animals is not the equivalent of DNIC or ‘anti-DNIC’ but rather is likely dependent on activity within a separate discrete descending circuit. We passionately believe that nomenclature matters when ascribing a mechanism to an observation as this clarity is a necessity in moving the field forward - descending control of nociception was recently introduced as a term to help draw a distinction from reflexive endpoints in awake animals and the neurophysiological correlates in anaesthetised preparations. These separate terminologies importantly help highlight differences between non-comparable endpoints but also the partially overlapping underlying mechanisms being studied. We hope that our comments are taken in the spirit that they are intended. We believe that commonality in terminology is a first vital step towards understanding the mechanisms that underlie the complex pain-like behaviours that we measure in wakeful animals upon application of varied paradigms.

We thank them for the constructive discussion on their highly impactful result. It is correct that the crystal structure of NTSR1-H4 has a 0.07-Å higher resolution than that of NTSR1-H4bm (2.64 vs. 2.71 Å). However, the structure of NTSR1-H4bm is more native, less affected by crystallization effects (TM1, ECL2, intracellular position of TM7), and its electron density is of higher quality in several key regions (e.g., ligand, ECL3, ligand-binding site including for instance F344 and Y347). Since one of the aims of the current manuscript is to compare the crystallographic and cryo-EM approaches, we believe that the structure of NTSR1-H4bm should be considered at least equally important as that of NTSR1-H4 for a fair comparison with the cryo-EM complex in the revised manuscript. As the coordinates of the cryo-EM complex are not publicly available yet, we cannot comment with absolute precision on the differences between the cryo-EM complex and the crystal structure of NTSR1-H4bm. However, the differences are certainly fewer and smaller compared to NTSR1-H4 (including for residues R6.54 and R6.55, which are directly affected by stabilizing mutations in NTSR1-H4 but not in NTSR1-H4bm). Of course, the cryo-EM complex undoubtedly represents a remarkable advancement and overcomes several limitations of the crystal structures. Regarding the electron density for the ligand, we agree that  2Fo−Fc maps can be evaluated at different contour levels, including sigma=1.25. However, we believe that the current panel in Fig. 2b suggests that insufficient electron density was observed to unambiguously model the ligand, as part of the chloroquinoline ring of SR48692 is not resolved in the map at that particular contour level. This ligand moiety is, however, better resolved at a typical sigma=1.0. Notably, the 2Fo−Fc map of NTSR1-H4bm is of higher quality, and it features the entire chloroquinoline ring of SR48692 even at higher sigma levels, including sigma=1.25, while no merging of density between ligand and protein is observed until very low contour levels. (As a side note, to prevent model bias, in both structures the ligand was actually fitted into the Fo−Fc map (not 2Fo−Fc), which was computed when only the protein and solvent had been modeled. To prevent “human” bias, the rhofit software from Global Phasing was used).",2021-12-20T11:21:56,mattiadeluigi,Mattia Deluigi,10.1101/2021.11.02.466983,Structure Determination of Inactive-State GPCRs with a Universal Nanobody,"Michael J.

The key findings are that the amount of actin recruited to pits does not seem to correspond to the maturity of the pits, that the actin network likely grows both laterally and inward from the base of pits, and that actin seems to counteract membrane tension. The imaging is interesting and the super-resolution view of clathrin coated pits are nice. The manuscript also presents evidence that Arp2/3 activity assists pit completion, as CK666 causes longer clathrin lifetimes. The later data about clathrin coat height and actin height are less convincing, because it is unclear whether these results are from multiple rounds of treatment or from one experiment. The authors could strengthen their manuscript by bolstering those later results (in Figs 3-4). The authors claim that Arp2/3 inhibition has the opposite effect when under membrane tension than it does under isotonic conditions. This is very intriguing, but a reader cannot tell if the results are replicated sufficiently to support the claim. How many biological replicates are reported in Fig 3H? In other words, how many times was a sample exposed to the treatment (e.g. CK666)?

The works published in this sense discuss the presence of only one virus already known to infect triatomines of the genus Triatoma infestans, called Triatoma virus. Therefore, this research aimed to investigate the composition of the Rhodnius prolixus viroma, which is totally unknown, in order to elucidate the insect-virus relationship and understand possible impacts of viral infections on the life cycle of these triatomines. Furthermore, the authors discussed the antiviral system of these insects and proposed the use of RNA interference (RNAi) as a tool in vector control strategies. As a result, the authors identified 7 new (+)ssRNA viruses in R. prolixus, labeled Rhodnius prolixus Virus 1-7 (RpV1-7), and observed that these RpVs are vertically transmitted from females to offspring. Furthermore, a system, active during the oogenesis of R. prolixus, that uses RNAi to protect the germline and embryos of this insect from viral infections has been reported. In this way, RpVs are able to maintain persistent and systemic infections without causing damage to the host, due to a reduction in the viral load. Overall, the work has an interesting study proposal, as it can contribute to a better understanding of the microbiota present in triatomines, how its transmission occurs, and raises questions about its importance and possible vector control strategies for Chagas disease. However, I would like to highlight some items that can be seen as limitations and propose suggestions for the authors to analyze. Major comments: 1) At the end of the Results, it was not clear to me whether the RNAi machinery of the adult females was transferred to the eggs or if they, through this machinery, produced dsRNA against the viral sequences and deposited them in the mature eggs (page 16). 2) In the discussion, the possibility of influences on the insect's vectorial capacity and possible implications for its reproduction in the presence of these viruses could be addressed. Are these viruses essential for oogenesis to occur correctly? How does the absence or presence of these viruses impact the biology and physiology of the insect? These questions were raised in order to understand the real importance of the presence of these viruses in R. prolixus. 3) When analyzing other works on virus detection in triatomines, I noticed that all of them conducted their experiments based on the purification of viral particles from insect samples (stool and intestinal contents, for example) ( https://doi.org/10.1590/S00..., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.j..., http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.... Furthermore, in some of them, detection of the viral particle was performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ( https://doi.org/10.1099/002.... As in this work the analyzes were performed based only on RNA transcriptomes, I believe it would be interesting to confirm the presence of these viruses in insects by identifying their viral particles, and not just their RNA sequences. Minor comments: 1) I would suggest the authors to reorganize the ideas in the introduction to ensure continuity of the subject to be covered. As it's written, the ideas seem to be out of order. I suggest the following construction: introduce the triatomines and medical relevance, R. prolixus and its oogenesis, host/virus interaction, antiviral defense by RNAi, objectives and previous results. 2) Orthography should be corrected in the first paragraph of Materials and Methods, page 20: “Previtello e genic stages and...” 3) I consider that Figure 1A is unrelated to Figures 1B-E and its title “Phylogenetic analysis of the R. prolixus viruses”. I suggest that this figure be placed separately from the others, keeping as title its explanatory sentence “Schematic of an ovariole in R. prolixus ”.",2021-12-15T14:53:46,disqus_fVITe2Cuqd,Albaniza L R do Nascimento,10.1101/2020.10.18.344325,Transovarial transmission fuels persistent infections of a core virome in the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius prolixus,"Tarcísio Fontenele de Brito, Vitor Lima Coelho, Maira Arruda Cardoso, Ingrid Alexandre de Abreu Brito, Fides Lea Zenk, Nicola Iovino, Attilio Pane",2020-10-18

We will provide additional description of the other structure with less mutagenesis in a revised version of the manuscript. However we disagree with the suggestion that our work is misleading or downplays the crystallographic work: First, the majority of the differences noted in the manuscript do not involve thermostabilizing mutations but rather either the DARPin (NPXXY motif), rat vs human (ECL3), and/or some combination of crystal packing and flexibility (TM1, ECL1). These effects are largely consistent with both structures, as we have considered both. Further, as the commenters have noted, some of these effects can be attributed to flexibility, alternative states, or other factors and thus are not necessarily ‘wrong’ in the crystal structure, which is why we have carefully avoided such language and instead chose to highlight these as differences. In cases where this may have been ambiguous, we have clarified the language. Second, the readjustment of R6.54 and R6.55 compared to the cryoEM structure, which we suggest likely involves 7.42 in this particular structure, does change somewhat in the back-mutated structure. However, while rearranged, there are still appreciable differences in the positions of R6.54 and R6.55 between the back-mutated and cryoEM structure that would seem to still preclude or at least modulate the binding of the water molecule consistent with the feature in the cryoEM map, and likely results from other changes in the receptor, for example a change in conformation of W321. We will add an additional panel and discussion of these differences in the revised version of the manuscript, but the point that this feature is indeed different in the cryoEM structure applies to both crystal structures and thus we feel is not misleading. To the second point, we don’t believe that we suggested that the pose of the ligand is in any way ambiguous in the crystal structures as it is not. We will certainly make sure to highlight this in the revised version. However, we would disagree with the assertion that the 2Fo-Fc map can only be considered at a sigma of 1.0; as sigma is a measure of standard deviations in the signal in the map. We felt like 1.25 sigma was the most flattering contour at which to visualize the ligand in the map attached to the 2.6 A structure, as at 1.0 sigma there was some merging of density between the ligand and TM6. We will however add additional panels into the manuscript highlighting the ligand at alternative contours with both crystallographic structures. We thank the commenters for the minor suggestions and have made the appropriate revisions.",2021-12-13T18:53:01,disqus_LqnwwWsWlV,Mike Robertson,10.1101/2021.11.02.466983,Structure Determination of Inactive-State GPCRs with a Universal Nanobody,"Michael J.

The results suggest that supplementation with quercetin, via gavage, exerts beneficial effects on lipid and glucose metabolism, modulating antioxidant enzymes, insulin signaling and secretion in hypertensive animals. Furthermore, the use of quercetin positively interfered with systemic blood pressure, reducing it and reversing the renal hypertrophic effect caused by the induced stenosis of the left renal artery in 2K1C rats. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and enzymatic modulating roles played by quercetin have already been described in experimental models of obesity and diabetes, and the investigation of insulin signaling in a model of renovascular hypertension is the gap that the article aims to fill. Although the results are promising and based on the scientific literature, the experiments carried out were not able to delimit which pathway quercetin interferes with the homeostasis of pancreatic islets. I believe the cause-and-consequence relationships were not well designed and therefore the results do not tell a linear story. Therefore, some methodological and literature-related limitations will be pointed out. 1) The relationship between insulin secretion, action and signaling in a model of renovascular hypertension was not adequately correlated at the beginning of the introduction (page 3). Perhaps bringing data from experiments with humans, located at the beginning of the discussion (page 9), and, if applicable, showing the modulated signaling pathway(s), would better corroborate the correlation proposed by the authors. Furthermore, in the introduction, angiotensin II is frequently mentioned and generates expectations that it will be investigated during the study, which is not the case. As hypertension, in the renovascular case, the focus of the work, is a secondary disease resulting from a primary metabolic disorder, the association with insulin metabolism and signaling should have been better developed, citing, for example, the role of the kidneys in homeostasis of glucose; 2) The chemical structure of flavonoids determines their antioxidant action, therefore, the choice of quercetin specifically, and not any other flavonoid, as the object of study was not argued. Physicochemical parameters intrinsic to the molecule should be evaluated, such as the formation and identification of metabolites and solubilization. Furthermore, as this is an in vivo animal model, pharmacodynamic parameters – absorption, distribution, metabolization and excretion – must be considered in order to determine the causal effect of the administration of the molecule in question; 3) The absence of the Sham group (false operated) exposed to quercetin impairs the analysis of the results of the other groups and the effect of quercetin in the proposed model. Furthermore, as this is a metabolic investigation in animals, the type of food provided (type, brand, etc.) must be detailed; 4) Regarding the administration of quercetin, it is necessary to present the acceptable daily consumption rate of this flavonoid, so that the meaningfulness of the results takes into account the level (low, intermediate, acceptable or supraphysiological) of intake presented and the reason for choosing such dosage (50 mg/kg/day). Thus, it would be fundamental to present a concentration-response curve (using lower and higher concentrations than the one tested, at least in Figure 1, items “b”, “d” and “g”); 5) Regarding the preprint formatting, the fact that the figures and the text clash makes the reading less dynamic; 6) It would be interesting to illustrate, with photographs, the kidneys (left and right) of each animal group, in order to verify their appearance and not just the mass (figure 1, item “d”); 7) Considering that the effect on energy metabolism is the focus of the work, the investigation of lipolytic (PPARα, AGTL) and lipogenic (LXR, SREBP1c) pathways could have been considered to better conclude the work. Likewise, the activity of isolated enzymes could have been evaluated in vitro in order to better consolidate the enzymatic modulation of quercetin in the experimental model in question; 8) Many of the Western Blottings (figures 4 and 5) present smear and low quality, thus clashing with the graphic results due to the variability, mainly in figure 4, items “a”, “f” and “h”, which hinders the final conclusion of the article. The inclusion of the uncropped gels in a supplementary material would help with this problem. 9) Part of figure 5 seems to be loose in the article, for example, in the text there is scarce contextualization and scientific validation for the investigation of muscarinic receptors M1 and M3; 10)The relationship between the antioxidant effect promoted by quercetin in adipose tissue cannot be directly related to the expression of SOD-2 and catalase enzymes; 11)It would be interesting to evaluate the modulation of quercetin in apoptosis and inflammation pathways, for example, to relate the possible protective effect to pancreatic islets;",2021-12-13T14:31:41,hellenmarianne,Hellen Marianne,10.1101/2021.09.10.459841,Quercetin prevents insulin dysfunction in hypertensive animals,"Cristiane Alves Serra, Alexandre Freire dos Reis, Bruno Calsa, Cintia Sena Bueno, Júlia Venturini Helaehil, Suelen Aparecida Ribeiro de Souza, Camila Andrea de Oliveira, Emerielle Cristine Vanzella, Maria Esméria Corezola do Amaral",2021-09-11

After the analysis of post-mortem brain tissues of COVID-19 patients and controls, they observed a correlation between neurological symptoms and increased ACE2 expression. They also correlated viral infection with injury to the blood-brain barrier and inflammation. Finally, they evaluated the levels of soluble PDGFRβ in the cerebrospinal fluid of COVID-19 patients. The data to support their conclusions were: through multiplexed immunostaining, the expression of ACE2 receptor was shown to be restricted to a subset of neurovascular pericytes. The authors hypothesized that viral infection to brain pericytes could lead to the disruption of blood-brain barrier, and indeed leakage of vascular fibrinogen into the central nervous system was observed associated with infected samples. They indicated the possible disruption of brain pericytes homeostasis because they observed significantly low levels of soluble PDGFRβ in the cerebrospinal fluid of infected patients. Overall, this is an interesting study that brings insights into the topic COVID-19 in an elaborate way. In order to improve the manuscript, I´ve made some comments/suggestions bellow as following: 1)	In the introduction page 4, it would be interesting to bring a more detailed approach to brain pericytes: what they are, their location in the neurovascular network, their importance in many neurovascular functions such as angiogenesis, formation and protection of the blood-brain barrier, vascular stability and regulation of blood flow. 2)	In the immunohistochemical methodology, it would be interesting to add how the images were quantified and which parameters were used to classify ACE2 immunoreactivity into low, moderate and high levels. 3)	In the first part of the study of ACE2 expression with post-mortem tissues, it would be interesting to define more clearly its study groups: COVID-19 without neurological symptoms, COVID-19 neurological and controls. Indicating which neurological symptoms were taken into account for such classification and what type of control is being used 4)	Still in the study of ACE2 expression, I felt a lack of images from the other COVID-19 group (e.g., without neurological symptoms) that would represent its non-expression. Would it be possible to include these new data as supplementary figures? 5)	In Figure 1(D): Please include in the legend the abbreviations used, indicating the meaning of Non-ICU and ICU. 6)	In Figure 2(A), SARS-CoV-2 detection step in tissues: identify which controls are being shown, as was done for the COVID-19 images. 7)	In the part of the study where they are measuring the pericytes marker PDGFRβ in cerebrospinal fluid samples, evaluating their homeostatic status and taking into account that a homeostatic imbalance of brain pericytes could lead to a series of disturbances (inflammation, disruption of the blood-brain barrier). I would suggest to include analysis of other inflammatory markers such as IL-6, TNF-β, IFN-ɣ, GM-CSF. Extra inflammatory markers, would give greater robustness to the findings 8)	In general, the authors satisfactorily structure the final discussion, bringing other studies to compose their arguments and results obtained.",2021-12-13T12:45:28,thaislopespinheiro,Thais Lopes Pinheiro,10.1101/2021.05.24.445532,Infection of brain pericytes underlying neuropathology of COVID-19 patients,"Matteo Bocci, Clara Oudenaarden, Xavier Sàenz-Sardà, Joel Simrén, Arvid Edén, Jonas Sjölund, Christina Möller, Magnus Gisslén, Henrik Zetterberg, Elisabet Englund, Kristian Pietras",2021-05-25

Here they look at two different medications, Disulfiram, an anti-alcoholism drug, and copper gluconate which is a common food additive or copper supplement. The study looks at how the mixture of these two drugs effects the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity at the cellular level. They compare this to how well the two drugs effect the activity of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity on their own. They found that a 1:1 ratio of these drugs does a very good job, going from around 67% for each drug on their own to over 90%  against -SARS-CoV-2 when joined together. They also found that the EC50 for the 1:1 combination was even lower than that of the two on their own. This research is very applicable to todays day because of the pandemic we are going through, although we are obviously most interested with what happens in vivo. I thought the research was very interesting though, and if it could be replicated in vivo could be very useful in fighting COVID-19. I thought the paper itself could use some work, but the information was there and it is important to get it out there. Areas for improvement: Major: I thought some of the major things that needed some improvement was the lack of an introduction and conclusion. The paper had great information and did a great job explaining the research, but an introduction is necessary to give background knowledge of research done in the past, why the research is important, etc. A conclusion was also missing and that would have helped the paper flow more and wrap up the research in a concise and understanding manner. Minor: There were a few grammar issues, but nothing too terrible. The author also went off on a tangent that was hard to understand, and didn’t really fit in the last paragraph of the results and discussion (starting at line 37).",2021-12-13T03:40:59,kellenwestra,kellen westra,10.1101/2021.09.17.460613,Copper(II) Gluconate Boosts the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Effect of Disulfiram In Vitro,"Luyan Xu, Wei Xu, Simeng Zhao, Suwen Zhao, Lu Lu, Bo-Lin Lin",2021-10-01

This hypothesis is based on the finding that members of the Cercopothecidae and Ponginae families of primates possess α-1 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alleles that are more resistant against neurotoxins of Naja sp venoms, snakes from the Elapidae family that have a similar evolutionary history: evolving initially in Africa and later spreading throughout Asia. I believe that the hypothesis is very interesting and the authors provide an interesting overview of it in the manuscript. However, it is not clear to me whether the authors can conclude an event of coevolution based on the data presented: a deeper analysis of it may be needed. I also think there are some limitations in the analysis presented (as pointed below), and I hope my observations help the authors to improve this work. Major comments: 1.	The authors provide a series of dendrograms without time divergence data. It would be useful to provide a time divergence data showing a temporal coincidence between primates and snakes evolutionary events to support the hypothesis. 2.	A sequence alignment of the α-1 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of different primates is presented showing different mutations between the receptors from different species. It would be interesting if the authors could discuss how (at least some of) these mutations could help in the resistance mechanism, based on what is known about the binding of the neurotoxins to the α-1 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. 3.	As your work presented, the clades of Platyrrhini and Lemuriformes were more susceptible to the venom of Naja then the other species that live in common areas with them. Both clades are separated from Africa and Asia and from the pressure from the Naja sp venom. Is there a possibility that these clades coevolved with neurotoxins found in venoms from Elapide members sympatric to these clades ? 4.	Venomics studies showed that snake venoms may vary depending on the environment even within the same species.  It was not very clear to me whether the venom source was from individuals collected from the same or different locations, and how this variable may affect the coevolution with primates? See  the work of Calvete 2008 Snake venomics and antivenomics of the arboreal neotropical pitvipers Bothriechis lateralis and Bothriechis schlegelii. J Proteome Res. 2008 Jun;7(6):2445-57. doi: 10.1021/pr8000139. 5.	The uses of the techniques may be more described to clarify the importance of the essays. I am not sure if this essay may demonstrate coevolution. I consider that, more experiments maybe apply in a more specific way. The limitations of the assay may generate a not clear conclusion. 6.	Is there any evidence that other toxins from the venoms showed a similar pattern of sensitivity/resistance? 7.	In order to propose a coevolution event, I would expect to observe a reciprocal effect between the two groups. What would be the characteristics evolved by the snakes that could have been impacted by the primates? Is there any evidence of such event? If not, that may be an adaptation of primates to the selection pressure of the snakes, and not necessarily a coevolution event. Minor comments: 1.	The authors report to have statistically analyzed the data, but that analysis is not presented in the figures. 2.	I could not find the supplementary material. Access to this material may help readers to better understand the results. 3.	The figure 4 have the indication of figure 2 4.	The clade Lorisiformes present a high susceptibility to almost all venoms, except that from the venom of Naja kaouthia. How do you interpret this result?

In the article, the authors demonstrated that heparan sulfate proteoglycans present in the extracellular matrix of cells function as binding receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 isolated from patients with COVID-19 interfered with the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which may be an additional antibody mechanism to neutralize the infection. It was also seen that SARS-CoV-2 binding and epithelial cell infection were blocked by low molecular weight heparins, as well as human nasal cell infection, and that dendritic cells and mucosal Langerhans cells  are able to capture SARS-CoV-2 via heparan sulfate proteoglycans and transmitting the virus to ACE2-positive cells. The data presented in the article are very important to understand the mechanisms of infection and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that still devastates the world; however, I noted some points and limitations about the article that will be punctuated below, which the authors might find useful to strengthen their conclusions. Comments: - Some points were commented during the article results, but they but they were not covered in the introduction, which makes it difficult to understand the article. For example, it would be interesting to include in the introduction a brief explanation about dendritic cells and their importance, what syndecans are and what their function and talk about exostosin-1. - In the result “SARS-CoV-2 targets dendritic cells for dissemination” is said about the dendritic cell and its importance in that context, but they do not explain why this specific cell was used and from which reference they took this knowledge. - I understood that liver cells express ACE2, but why didn't you use cells from the gastrointestinal tract or the respiratory tract from the beginning? They are more correlated with the virus, and there are references demonstrating that the expression of ACE-2 is higher in these cells than in the liver cells? - In the discussion of the results presented in Figure 3, letters E and F, it is not clear why you used only Calu-3 cells and stopped using Caco-2. - In the results shown in Figure 4, letter B and Figure 6, letters H and I, why didn't the experiments also continue using heparin? Given that it is widely used in the clinic as well, these results would be interesting. - Why syndecan 4 stopped being used after figure 4? In the results shown both syndecan 1 and syndecan 4 have good results, I think it would be interesting to continue the experiments with both, or justify the choice to focus only on syndecan 1. - In Figure 7, the authors state that nasal cells have ACE-2 and that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the cell directly, but the result is very low, close to 0, is the result really significant? - Another important point would be to comment on which unfractionated heparin was used. Although it is known that porcine intestinal mucosa heparin is the most used heparin in the world, but there are countries that use only bovine heparin and its use has grown recently, so I think it would be important to identify which animal source is. - It would be interesting to improve the writing of the text of the methodology “pseudovirus infection assays”, as it stands the text is vague and confuse. Also, I think ng is not a good cell unit. - The way of showing the results is not clear, as the normalized value bars for 1.0 and 0.0 do not have an error bar, and graph 7B has no error. Therefore, the statistics need to be revised. - The axis of the graphs in figure 7A are very small and must be improved to facilitate visualization.",2021-12-11T20:57:58,kayenemicheli,Kayene Micheli,10.1101/2020.08.18.255810,Infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 depends on heparan sulfate proteoglycans,"Marta Bermejo-Jambrina, Julia Eder, Tanja M.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.23.465040v3#comment-5640669551,biorxivstage,3,"The manuscript by Ruiz-Sola et al. investigates the relationship between photoprotection responses, carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCM) and CO2 availability in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. While photoprotection responses, mediated by LHCSR3, LHCSR1 and PSBS, are traditionally described as triggered by excess of light, this manuscript highlights the role of intracellular CO2 levels (both deriving from the environment and from mitochondria metabolism) in regulating these responses. Indeed, it demonstrated that photoprotection, and especially LHCSR3-mediated responses, are from one side inhibited in conditions in which inorganic carbon is largely available and abundant (acetate and external CO2 supply) and on the other side induced in conditions of reduced CO2 availability. Furthermore, CCM are also induced under high light (HL), in response to a drop in intracellular CO2 levels due to increased photosynthetic carbon fixation. While changes in the expression levels of both LHCSR3 and CCM genes at different CO2 concentration and under HL respectively, were previously reported, this manuscript has the novelty to connect these observations in an elegant experimental set up with several genetic backgrounds to confirm and prove their hypothesis through the use of mutants affected in mitochondrial respiration and of metabolic modeling. The proposed model for light-independent regulation of photoprotection is convincing and solidly backed-up by data. In addition a role for CIA5 in positively regulating LHCSR3 (and to a lesser extent PSBS) mRNA expression and in negatively regulating LHCSR1 at the post-transcriptional level is shown. However, we have some comments and suggestions to improve the manuscript, listed below. Major comments Figure 3, and corresponding result paragraph pages 6 to 8: - A large part of the results (1.5 pages) focuses on modelling the interaction between acetate metabolism and intracellular CO2 levels. Although we are not experts in mathematical modeling and thus we are unable to give proper feedback regarding this part of the paper, we think it adds small value to the main results of the paper. This is especially true as the modelling relies on a number of assumptions (listed at the bottom of page 7) which are not supported by literature nor experimental data, weakening the solidity of its conclusions. As it is, only assumption iv (page 7, “the acetate uptake is low (...) for the mutants (as indicated in Fig 2C and F)” is backed up by data. We suggest moving figure 3 to Supplementary material and shorten its description in the results and discussion. Please also provide better support to justify the assumptions i to iii, as well as the assumption that photon uptake is not altered in the mutants (e.g. do they have similar chlorophyll content?) and make the conclusions more solid. - Page 6, “In line with the experimentally observed values, we found that the predicted generation times for the icl and dum11 strains (...) did not differ from those of LL grown WT cells”. Please, provide the experimental values for the mutant strains, or rephrase the sentence. In Figure S1F to K: - During exposure to L2, the basal fluorescence Fo’ in the presence of acetate (and to a lesser extent CO2) is rising together with the maximal fluorescence Fm’. Please provide explanation or hypotheses for this fact, and if it might or not affect ETR and NPQ calculations. Also consider replacing “qE” with “fast-induced fluorescence quenching” or simply “NPQ”, as other regulation mechanisms might affect these fluorescence measurements. - Please precise the time points you used for assessment of Fo, Fm, and calculation of qE. To make this figure more understandable please provide clearer fluorescence traces in Figure S1 (C-K), showing only Fo, Fm and Fm' (ideally one plot for each genotype to be consistent with Y(II) and NPQ plots, L-N and O-Q) and a separate panel with Fo and Fo'. Figure 6B and corresponding text page 11: - Please provide an explanation for the cia5 mutant line accumulating high LHCSR1 protein and not fully reverting to wild type level in the complementation line under VLCO2 (and dark/ air). This aspect needs to be taken into account and clarified, especially in light of CIA5 proposed role as LHCSR1 regulator at the post transcriptional level. Rephrase this sentence “However, LHCSR1 protein over-accumulated in the cia5 mutant under all conditions tested, although the WT phenotype was only partially restored in cia5-C (Fig. 6B)” as this the case only for HL/air. Minor comments Title: Please add “algal” to the title, or a similar clarification. Introduction: - Page 3, when mentioning carbonic anhydrases (CAH) as part of the CCM please list the ones involved in CCM. Not all CAH are part of CCM (also it is useful to see their names, since the expression levels of some of them are measured in the results part). - Page 4, in the sentence ""Here, using genetic, transcriptomic and mathematical modelling approaches, we demonstrate that the inhibition of LHCSR3 accumulation and CCM activity by acetate is at the level of transcription and a consequence of metabolically produced CO2"" please replace ""transcriptomic"" with ""expression analysis on selected genes"", since no transcriptomics work has been shown in this manuscript. - Page 4, please reformulate the sentence ""This work emphasizes the critical importance of intracellular CO2 levels in regulating LHCSR3 expression  and  how  light  mediated  responses  may  be  indirect  and  reflect changes in internal CO2 levels resulting from light intensity dependent, photosynthetic fixation of intracellular CO2"". Based on the previous reports and from this work, we can say that internal CO2 levels are important in regulating activation and inhibition of LHCSR3-photoprotection mechanisms, BUT it does not mean that the light effect is indirect, this has not been proved yet. Furthermore, photoprotection by NPQ could lead to diminished CO2 fixation rate (especially sustained “photoinhibitory” quenching types), thereby increasing internal CO2 concentration which would according to your model repress photoprotective genes. This could be the case for genes involved in qE but may not be a general rule for “photoprotection”. The title could also reflect that aspect by specifying NPQ, qE in lieu of photoprotection. qRT-PCR results: - qRT-PCR results are described here as ""mRNA accumulation"". Please replace this nomenclature with ""relative expression levels"" or ""relative gene expression"". - It is stated in the methods, page 17, that the results presented are normalized on a reference standard gene, GBLP. However, the results presented seem to be (also?) normalized on the WT LL air. Is this correct? If so, please precise or clarify it. Instead of normalizing the data to the WT LL air, we suggest normalizing the transcript abundance of the target genes in each sample to your internal reference standard gene (GBLP) only. - Please provide a description on how the relative gene expression levels were calculated. We suggest calculating by determining the ΔCt levels of the sample compared to the standard and the 2^(-∆Ct) as final value. Paragraph ""LHCSR3 transcript accumulation is impacted by acetate metabolism"": - page 4, it is not clear in here the transition between TAP and HSM media. - page 4, rest of the text and figures legends, please indicate CO2 concentration in ppm (according also to figure 6D) instead of 5% CO2. - icl-C line not behaving the same. Paragraph ""CO2 generated from acetate metabolism inhibits accumulation of LHCSR3 transcript and protein"": - Page 5, “RHP1 (...) encodes a CO2 channel shown to be CO2 responsive and to accumulate in cells growing in a high CO2 atmosphere”. It is unclear here if RHP1 is sensitive to intracellular, extracellular, or both levels of CO2. Please better describe how the protein levels reflect the intracellular CO2 concentration. - Since Figure 1 includes results both described in this and in the previous paragraph, we suggest grouping the results described in Fig1 in a single paragraph and make a shorter but clearer description of the results. - Fig 1: you could  merge Fig 1A and C in a single plot with WT icl, icl-C and dum 11 in LL and HL to make the comparison between the mutants clearer. Also, the same can be done for the panels B and D. Paragraph “Impact of carbon availability in other qE effectors” - Page 8, ""We took HL acclimated cells that typically accumulate both LHCSR3 and LHCSR1  proteins  (Fig.  S2A)  and  performed  photosynthetic  measurements  in  the  absence  or presence of 20 mM sodium bicarbonate; the bicarbonate addition was just before performing the photosynthetic measurements. As expected, bicarbonate enhanced rETR (Fig. S2B) and….almost  completely  suppressed  qE  despite  the  fact  both  LHCSR3  and  LHCSR1  had accumulated in the cells (Fig. S2)"". The accumulation of these proteins was not checked in presence of bicarbonate in this particular experiment (the bicarbonate was added shortly before measuring photosynthetic parameters). Please, rephrase the sentence. - Page 9 and Figure 4B and Figure 5C "" PSBS protein accumulation could not be evaluated because it was not detectable under the experimental conditions  used. "" It is surprising you could not detect PSBS in these conditions (600 uE), while it was possible in the conditions described in Fig 6B. At least the HL conditions (600 uE) were the same in these two experiments. Please provide an explanation for this, or if it is not possible, rephrase without mentioning PSBS expression and accumulation in the text and for clarity reasons remove Fig4A. Paragraph “CCM1/CIA5 links HL and low CO2 responses” - Page 9, ""To elucidate the molecular connection between  photoprotection  and  CCM,  we  analyzed  mRNA  accumulation  from  the  CCM  genes encoding LCIB and LCIE (involved in CO2 uptake), HLA3, LCI1, CCP1,CCP2, LCIA, BST1 (Ci transporters), CAH1, CAH3, CAH4 (carbonic anhydrases) and the nuclear regulator LCR1, all previously shown to be strongly expressed under low CO2 conditions (see (49)for a review on the roles of each of these proteins and (45)for the more recently discovered BST1)."" Please provide the whole name for the reported abbreviation of the proteins that were not mentioned earlier in the text. Paragraph “Intracellular CO2 levels regulate photoprotective and CCM gene expression in the absence of light” - Page 11 and Figure 6C: the figure is unclear, making the quantification hard to pick up and understand. Please consider replacing the “LHCSR3 (r.u.)” line above the panel by a histogram clearly displaying the LHCSR3/ATPB ratio; add error bars. If no repeats/error are available, please refrain from using these quantification data and rephrase the paragraph page 11 to replace quantitative statements (""...which  was reflected by a 3-fold change in the accumulation of the protein…"", ""and 21 fold (protein) compared to air dark conditions (Fig. 6A-C)..."", ""...and protein level (by a factor of~9)..."") by qualitative ones. - Page 11, ""This CIA5-independent regulation of mRNA in the presence of light could account for the contribution of light signaling in LHCSR3 gene expression, possibly via phototropin (10)"" This should be discussed properly in the discussion section. - Page 11, “the cia5 mutant did not accumulate significant amounts of LHCSR3 protein under any of the conditions tested (Fig. 6B)” The lack of LHCSR3 in HL in the cia5 mutant is quite striking considering that its transcript level is quite high and similar to wild type. Please provide a possible explanation for this observation. - Page 12, please replace "" in accord"" with ""in line"" or ""it fits the hypothesis"" - Page 12, Fig 6E, for clarity, please develop the statement  ""In  contrast  to LHCSR3,  sparging  with VLCO2 only partly relieved the suppression of transcript accumulation for the CCM genes in the presence of DCMU (Fig. 6E)"". For instance, consider adding “..., bringing it back to LL levels instead of the accumulation observed in HL in the control (see dotted line in Fig. 6E)”. Discussion - Page 13, ""Increased  CO2 levels  were  found  to  dramatically  repress LHCSR3 mRNA accumulation, in agreement with previously published works (34, 35), but had little impact on accumulation of LHCSR1and PSBS transcripts"". It is hard to say if it has a little or no impact on PSBS gene expression. We suggest not putting emphasis on the PSBS expression levels difference. - Page 14, beginning of last paragraph, “Our data demonstrate that most of the light impact on LHCSR3 expression is indirect”. Please tone down these sentences and discuss them with regards to the recent study by Redekop et al. (ref. 46). We suggest replacing this sentence with ""Our data demonstrate that besides LHCSR3 gene expression variation together with changes in the light environment, it is also tightly linked to CO2 intracellular changes”. - Page 14 ""It is tempting to propose that CO2 could be considered as a retrograde signal for remote control of nuclear gene expression, integrating both mitochondrial and chloroplastic metabolic activities"". This sentence is very speculative, although clearly marked as such. To further soften the point, please consider adding “Further studies will have to be carried on to confirm or infirm this possibility”. - Page 15 ""The CIA5-independent light-dependent induction of  photoprotective  genes  possibly  involves  phototropin,  as  previous  shown (10),  but  may  also involve retrograde signals such as reactive species (46, 77). Our findings also highlight the need to develop  an  integrated  approach  that  examines  the  role  of  CO2 and  light,  with  respect  to  CO2 fixation, photoreceptors, and redox conditions on the regulation of photoprotection and to consider photoprotection in a broader context that includes various processes involved in managing the use and consequences of absorbing excess excitation"". If you want to discuss photoprotection relationships with photoperception etc you should give more context, otherwise it is not easy to catch for people who are not familiar with this possible connection. The data of this manuscript do not show any experiments related to photoperception, yet and it has been mentioned in four times in the paper. In our opinion this does not fit in the discussion of this manuscript. - Data S2A, please replace “reaction names” by “enzyme names”. - Figures S1C to K, Figure S2C, Figure S4A to C, it is stated that the fluorescence is normalized to Fm, when it seems to be normalized to the maximum fluorescence reached during the experiment (highest Fm’ point). Please correct either the figures or the legend. - Figure S2B, it is stated that the statistical analyses are shown in the graph, though they appear to be missing.

I will definitely check it out in the future. That being said, I think ALE should work in repeat regions, in a way. It uses a number of different metrics, one of which is k-mer-based. And it uses the evenness of read depth as well, so errors in repeats that cause alignments to skew to error-free instances of the repeat will cause uneven depth and therefore a worse ALE score. But Merqury sounds good too, and I like your idea of using both. Lots of stuff to try in the future!

The paper was very much an interesting read, and I have learned much about the subject area. Below are some comments and suggestions for the paper: Figure 1A/B: It may be beneficial to include the original data to the supplemental figures. If there are limitations by converting the data down to z-scores, possible data may not be lost. Figure 1D: Clarification as to what “number of metabolites” means. Figure 2A: A comment as to if the male and female brain tumors being on different hemispheres should be ignored or is of importance to the paper. Figure 3B: The paper mentions that male cells incorporate 20% more nitrogen from [13C5 15N2]Gln into nucleotides than female cells (Fig. 3B). It may be helpful to add an explanation as to how the graph displays this increase in 20% (explaining how it is quantified). An overlay of the two graphs may make it easier to compare the two. The graph is also missing a y-axis. Figure 5E: In the paper, it is mentioned that NAC significantly restored cell number in male and female BSO treated cells (Fig. 5E).

The authors combined a large-scale comparative phylogenomic approach with biochemical characterization of putative novel phyllobilins to shed light on how the degradation pathway evolved. This manuscript points to the evolution of chlorophyll degradation, in particular the later detoxification steps, having accompanied the green lineage’s transition to land. An extensive list of orthologous genes from a diverse number of species was identified. The manuscript stands out for the wide evolutionary view on the chlorophyll degradation pathway, which is neither an easy nor a common research subject. The in silico approach for phyllobilins identification is quite innovative and will surely give great hints for biomolecules discovery. A comprehensive bioinformatics work has been done to carefully identify and select the genes analyzed in the manuscript and the related phylogenetics figures are outstanding. Although this work is of great interest, we have some comments that could be addressed in the next version. Major comments - We would suggest to tone down the title as it may be that less or no chlorophyll catabolites were detected in mosses, charophytes and chlorophytes due to the smaller number of species analyzed (Fig.5), and some of these clades may have evolved other phyllobilins exporting and modifying proteins. Please discuss these possibilities. - Page 9, line 16: regarding the identification of 15 putatively novel phyllobilins, mass spectrometry data together with in silico produced list of diagnostic ions are presented to support these structures. Would it be possible to provide additional confirmation via a standard (an internal or a synthesized one) or alternatively to state which other molecules these m/z plus profiles could be corresponding to? How likely is it that they correspond to other unrelated compounds? - Page 5, line 11, comment on two species lacking CAO. Are they lacking chlorophyll b? Minor comments - Intro, page 3, line 19, explain why it is unlikely that nitrogen remobilization be a conserved evolutionary trigger. - Page 8, line 15, what is the carbon source used for heterotrophic growth? Line 19, instead of “etc” list all conditions tested. - Page 9, line 24, could you discuss or introduce whether oxidations are spontaneous or enzymatic? - Could you comment in the discussion about the significance of Chl breakdown catabolites in cellular signaling from an evolutionary point of view? - Methods, in the paragraph “Plant material growth and chlorophyll degradation induction”, page 15, lines 1-12: several of the growth conditions are missing e.g. at which temperature S. moellendorfii was growing? At which temperature and humidity was the dark incubation of leaves performed? - In the Sup. Figure 6 B, the structure of phyllobilin 3b is not shown. It could be nice to have that too or to explain why it is not shown. Please, also include the relevant spectra from the remaining identified compounds as supplemental data (assuming that the 4 presented spectra/structures are also of novel compounds). - Maybe we missed it, but where can we find the identifiers of the genes that were used in the gene trees shown Figures 2, 3 and 4? - The Sup.

Criticisms: The structure of the Omicron RBD made using mutations in Pymol cannot be trusted without proper structural data on the omicron RBD, because Omicron contains a high amount of mutations, the mutations cluster in  a very disordered region of the RBD and influence of the glycans is disregarded (See e.g for their importance https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.... The methods used to predict stability generally tend to work better on decreased stability than for gain of function. There is no benchmark against existing biophysical assays (e.g from deep mutational scanning) to show that the used method  (i-mutant3.0) works on the RBD. In addition, the effect of multiple mutations are likely not additive but subject to epistasis. The used predictor is quite old and should be compared with newer approaches. In general, protein docking is unreliable to estimate binding affinity in absolute terms. Especially in this case because the structures used were obtained by simple mutagenesis in PyMol without any equilibration/relaxation. The conclusions are not be trusted without additional experimental or more reliable computational analysis that includes the proper glycan shield of the protein and relaxed structures. It is unclear how a table of amino acid composition and corresponding secondary structure prediction is useful or has any meaning for the conclusions of the article. The fact that the RBD is mainly alpha helical is not an indicator for high structural stability. The differences between the predicted fractions of alpha helices are meaningless and very small.

Apologies if I've missed something in my quick read of the paper, but one concern I have about the interpretation of the findings is that low RF distances might be reflecting a lack of precision (i.e. more nodes collapsed to polytomies) rather than higher accuracy; see Smith 2019, Biol Lett, 10.1098/rsbl.2018.0632 – would this really make a tree ""better""? And I didn't quite follow whether collapsing nodes at random with -R might resolve nodes in a fashion that is not consistent with the original analyses; if so, this could potentially inflate RF distances. Presumably the size of the simulated trees precluded the use of any of the more robust alternatives to the RF distance (e.g. Smith 2020, Bioinformatics, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa614)?",2021-12-06T11:51:44,PalaeoSmith,Martin R.

(1) is an extension of nucleic acid structural studies aimed at targeting pathogens at the genome or transcript level, rather than at the protein level (2, 3). Furthermore, having identified sites of interest, they explore ways of predicting whether an 18-base antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) is likely to be therapeutically effective. This is a promising first step in dealing with a long-neglected disease. While some metric abbreviations (e.g. minimum free energy; MFE) are in general use, a table showing how their abbreviations correspond to historical usages would facilitate comparison with other works. For example, the contribution of base order (rather than base composition) to structure, which is here assessed as the Z-score (1), relates to the ""folding of randomized sequence difference"" (FORS-D) values of one group (2, 3) and the ""genome-scale ordered RNA structure"" (GORS) values of another (4). For controls, the ""Scanfold"" technology includes the controversial shuffling of single bases so destroying base order (rather than of dinucleotides or trinucleotides that would have kept a degree of base order). The authors could point out that, for their purposes, randomizing base order by single base shuffling (5) is now generally accepted. The authors note that the coding region of a gene can appear ""to be unstructured (as evidenced by mediocre MFEs and positive Z-scores)"". This is attributed to factors such as ""to promote rapid translation,"" or ""modulating accessibility to regulatory molecules."" However, it has long been known that, whether genomes are DNA or RNA, the potential for stem-loop structures is a pervasive, genome-wide, property (4), which is likely to facilitate ""kissing-loop"" recombination. A need to encode proteins conflicts with this, especially in genes under positive Darwinian selection (5, 6). Thus, despite synonymous flexibility at third codon positions, there is generally greater structure potential in non-genic genome regions and, for eukaryotes, also in introns (rather than exons that tend to be purine-rich; 7). Finally, for a discovered target site to retain its therapeutic vulnerability, it should be conserved from generation to generation within a species. At present, it appears that there are insufficient M. ulcerans sequences for detailing within-species conservation. The authors rely on inter-species data from other mycobacterial species. While this might facilitate the discovery of general anti-mycobacterial ASOs, they would not be optimized for an individual species. 1. Rouse WB et al.

Here some minor points to consider - you do not mention MIRIAM identifiers. I assume all of your analysis is focused on the subset of `BQB_IS`. This should be clearly stated and also be discussed how the metrics would work or could be extended to handle all of the MIRIAM qualifiers - you mention the large set BiGG annotated models. One issue with the model collection is that many of the models are variants of a single ecoli model with minimal changes. Also all models are build from a common parts repository (the universal model), so that annotations are shared between the models. So despite being a collection of annotated models it is not very representative. In addition the model annotations are created based on a tool ( https://github.com/draeger-... - A comparison between the curated and uncurated models in biomodels would be very informative. An important part of the curation process is the addition of annotation at biomodels. Performing your analysis on the uncurated branch should provide a good estimation of the real annotation coverage/metrics. - Uniprot annotations are important annotations for reactions which allow to encode the catalyzing protein. This information is very important to map protein data on reactions, e.g., in the context of FBA models. These should probably be encoded via the qualifier `BQB_HAS_PART`. This is crucial information and part of many models. - a correlation plot between the metrics could be very interesting. It would be interesting to see color coded scatter plots of different subsets of the models (e.g. model size, domain, metabolism/signalling, year of submission) Best Matthias",2021-12-02T21:31:49,disqus_ZpshIJlLcT,Matthias König,10.1101/2021.10.09.463757,SBMate: A Framework for Evaluating Quality of Annotations in Systems Biology Models,"Woosub Shin, Joseph L.

How did the authors reach the conclusion that the US science education system is better than that of every single other country in the planet? Have these analyses been performed in other countries? Which studies are the authors sourcing from? ""By almost any measure, the U.S. remains the world leader in basic and applied research.

In the same way that the majority of Nobel Prizes have been won by men and this does not mean that men are leaders in the life sciences, the majority of US Nobel winners does not necessary imply that the US is a leader in the life science. Rather, it likely tells more about structural biases in the evaluation of science and in scientific participation and output in the life sciences, and bias in the Nobel attribution process. Similarly, papers in the life science are already heavily skewed towards US representation. Even with equal citation numbers, the majority of  papers within any citation tier would thus also be from the US. The definition of what ""top life science journals"" are is also clearly built on anglophony and US-centric axiologies. The authors seem to see meritocracy in academic aspects that are clearly not acritically so, and that are in fact rife with Matthew effect and US-favourable biases.

The Introduction addresses what is known/inferred regarding the heterogeneity of exocytotic responses in neuroendocrine cells and sets up the framework to investigate what is not known. The authors make a good case at comparing the strengths and limitations of TIRF with conventional fluorophores and amperometric recordings and at how the read outs of both methods are not easy to integrate or reconcile. The regulation of secretion by the fusion pore itself was, until now, assigned to size, behavior as a sieve, and commitment to full fusion versus kiss and run.  The findings reported here by Zhang et al add a layer of complexity by revealing that the duration of the fusion pore is bimodal and regulated rather than stochastic, as previously assumed. In doing so, this paper opens the door to future work on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the bimodal nature of regulated DCV exocytosis. The experiments are elegant and very meticulous, many possible hypotheses and interpretations are offered and justified. Each conclusion is supported by more than one experimental approach and by numerous, rigorous, original controls. Interpretation of the results includes deep insights in addition to the primary description, such insights may or may not have been contemplated when outlining the experiments, but there they are, exquisitely capitalising on the findings. Examples that illustrate this point are: i) slow events derive exclusively from docked vesicles, which means that the state of docking influences subsequent behavior of the pore. ii) Release by newcomers is always fast, which implies that tethering, priming, docking and fusion occur within a few milliseconds of granule arrival at the fusion site. iii) Rapid efflux of luminal cargo through a narrow pore delays external dye entry, and so on and so forth. I can´t wait to see what the authors will do next with the new imaging technique reported here.",2021-12-01T14:42:51,,Claudia Tomes,10.1101/2021.11.01.466835,High-Speed Imaging Reveals the Bimodal Nature of Dense Core Vesicle Exocytosis and Jet Flow through the Fusion Pore,"Pengcheng Zhang, David Rumschitzki, Robert H.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.08.443256v2#comment-5622056706,biorxivstage,0,"This manuscript investigates how Gq signaling regulates egg-laying behavior in C. elegans by determining the relative contributions and sites of action of the two main branches of Gq signaling, PLCbeta and Trio RhoGEF. Mutants in PLCbeta and Trio RhoGEF are examined for steady-state egg-retention, vulval muscle calcium transients, and egg-laying in response to serotonin, optogenetic stimulation of the HSN motor neurons, or phorbol esters. Experiments are solid and performed rigorously, with appropriate sample sizes, statistics, and data presentation. The major conclusions are that PLCbeta acts exclusively in neurons, that Trio acts in both neurons and muscles, and that both pathways promote egg-laying by production of the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG). Finally, it is concluded that DAG promotes egg-laying independently of the known DAG effectors UNC-13 and PKC. There is strong support for the conclusions that PLCbeta acts in neurons and that Trio RhoGEF has a major role in the vulval muscles. Support for other conclusions is somewhat weaker, and it would be good to provide stronger evidence or to tone down the conclusions. The title of the paper should also be changed accordingly. Major points: 1. The conclusion that both PLCbeta and Trio RhoGEF pathways promote egg-laying by production of DAG is based on the clear rescue of these mutants by the phorbol ester PMA, a DAG-mimetic. However, it is possible that PMA is a dirty drug and has other non-DAG related targets, a possibility supported by the fact that loss of known DAG targets does not block the effect of PMA. Thus, these caveats should be discussed and this conclusion should be toned down. 2. It is concluded that DAG promotes egg-laying independently of known DAG targets UNC-13 and PKC. This conclusion is based on the fact that the phorbol ester PMA still stimulates egg-laying in single mutants of unc-13 or individual PKC genes. In addition to the possibility that PMA acts via a DAG-independent mechanism (see point 1 above),  there are other caveats to this interpretation. There are multiple PKC genes that may be redundant or PMA may act via both UNC-13 and PKC genes (unc-13; pkc double mutants were not tested). Thus, these caveats should be discussed and this conclusion should be toned down. 3. The conclusion that unc-73/Trio RhoGEF acts in neurons in addition to muscle is based only on the quite weak rescue of the unc-73 mutant steady-state egg-laying defect by pan-neuronal expression of unc-73  (Figure 1K). One concern is that the unc-73 mutant (the control) had a considerably stronger defect in this experiment than in other data presented in the paper (Fig. 1I), raising the possibility that the weak rescue is just intrinsic variability in the behavior. Also, given that this rescue involves overexpression from a multicopy array, it is possible that there is leaky expression in other tissues such as muscle which would confound the interpretation. It is also implied that there is stronger rescue by coexpression of unc-73 in neurons and muscle than in muscle alone (Fig. 1K), but these two groups are not compared for statistical significance. Without stronger evidence that unc-73 acts in neurons, the conclusion should be toned down. 4. It is unclear why the egg-laying defect of egl-8/PLCbeta mutants is rescued by optogenetic stimulation of HSN neurons but not by serotonin – this is an interesting but weird result. A model is proposed (lines 488-506 in the Discussion), but it is quite confusing and hard to follow – a model figure might help. It seems that the authors propose that PLCbeta may act outside of the HSNs to promote egg-laying, perhaps in the VC neurons. However, it has not been demonstrated that pan-neuronal rescue of egl-8 is able to rescue its serotonin-resistant phenotype and that muscle-specific expression fails to rescue, which are important experiments to conclude that egl-8/PLCbeta is indeed acting in neurons. It would also be interesting to see what happens with HSN and VC-specific rescue. 5. Related to point 4 above, in several places it is stated that PLCbeta and Trio RhoGEF act presynaptically (lines 84, 485-487). Given that it is unclear which specific neurons these pathways act in, it is unclear whether they are indeed “presynaptic.” We suggest avoiding the terms “presynaptic” and “postsynaptic” and instead say “neuron” and “muscle.” Minor points: 1. In Fig 1J, it appears that pan-neuronal rescue of egl-8/PLCbeta actually causes hyperactive egg-laying. It is unclear whether this is due to overexpression or possible ectopic expression, which would have caveats for inferring a neuronal site of action of endogenous egl-8/PLCbeta based on the use of this transgene. 2. line 337-338: In data presented in this paper, an egl-8(sa47) mutant is reported to be resistant to serotonin, whereas it was previously reported to be sensitive (Bastiani et al. 2003). It is suggested that the discrepancy may be due to different levels of serotonin. However, given that the previous paper used a lower concentration of serotonin (7.5 mM instead of 18.5 mM), this explanation does not make sense. Additionally, Bastiani et al. reported that an unc-13(e51) mutant laid eggs in response to serotonin, again inconsistent with the results of the current paper where unc-13 is shown to be resistant. This discrepancy should also be pointed out, even if it cannot be explained. The previous paper also examined a third allele of egl-8, md1971, and found it to be sensitive to serotonin. A reexamination of that mutant would also be useful. 3. line 508: it is stated that Trio RhoGEF acts in motor neurons to control locomotion behavior. However, Hu et al. 2011 only showed rescue of unc-73/Trio RhoGEF mutants by expression in widely expressed neuronal promoters (unc-119 or egl-3 promoters), and did not observe rescue by motor-neuron specific promoters (unc-17 and unc-47 promoters). 4. For the calcium imaging experiments in Figures  4 & 5, it is unclear how frequency of calcium transients is measured. Is this the frequency of transients during the entire recording or only during active egg-laying states? If it is during the entire recording, how to control for different numbers of active states from animal to animal? In the trace shown in Fig 4A, a dgk-1 mutant appears to have a higher frequency of transients than wild-type outside the active state as well as an increased amplitude of egg-laying transients – is this trace not representative? 5. Two pkc-1 mutants were stimulated by PMA but one wasn’t (Fig 6D). This discrepancy is not discussed. 6. line 312: It is stated that rescue of unc-73 by expression from a muscle-specific promoter is greater than from a neuron-specific promoter. Though this appears to be true in the data presented, this conclusion is based on comparing rescue by different transgenes; given that there is often variability in rescue even by different transgenes of the same construct, this is a tricky comparison to make. All of these rescue lines are overexpressed and could be overexpressed to different levels or with different amounts of mosaicism, either of which could affect the level of rescue. 7. line 464: “To determine whether serotonin promotes egg laying through Protein Kinase C…” – however, the following experiment does not actually test pkc mutants for their serotonin response. 8. line 284: it is stated that wild-type worm retain 12 eggs, yet in Fig 1C, it says 15. In line 330, it states that 70% of HSN-deficient worms laid eggs in response to serotonin, but the data in Fig 2B shows slightly under 60%. 9. typos: line 367 – should be egl-8(n488); line 430 – should be Fig. 5B.

This, like the 2001 second edition (1), was published by the University of Chicago Press. In both editions, Provine defers to Mark Adams (1968) ""for an account of the Russian school's"" contributions (2). However, important post-1971 works of these biohistorians (3) may have been overlooked. In my previous comment, I noted Adams' reinterpretations that appeared around 1990. To draw attention likewise to Provine, I recommend that Johri et al. cite his second edition, not the first edition. There, Provine provides an ""afterword"" that goes far beyond the diffident reservations that concluded his 1971 edition. Whereas the strong influence of his University of Chicago mentor, Richard Lewontin, is acknowledged for the first edition, Provine's mature and independent viewpoint emerges in the second. Readers should be aware of it. For Adams the deemed enlightenment was an ""epiphany,"" but for Provine it was slower. In 2001 Provine (1) wrote: ""The evolutionary synthesis came unraveled for me during the period since 1980. Historically, my examination of this period … showed that it was not a synthesis, but rather a systematic diminution of the factors in evolution, and I now call it the 'evolutionary constriction' …. The unity of evolutionary biology inherent in the 'synthesis' has been replaced by a much more interesting and fascinating complex of different levels marching to different drummers. … In 1970 I could see the origins of theoretical population genetics as being an unalloyed good for evolutionary biology …. Now I see these same theoretical models of the early 1930s, still widely used today, as an impediment to understanding.” To remedy, Provine (1) recommended the works of various authors (e.g. Nils Roll-Hansen's translations of Wilhelm Johannsen) and concluded with Chapter 7 of his own masterpiece (3). This featured the nineteenth century peripatric speciation (today, founder principle) studies of John Gulick, and the non-geographical reproductive isolation studies (today, biological species concept) of Darwin's young research associate, George Romanes (4). 1.
