In A lineages, D614G reached parity with D614 in published sequences by late 2020 and D614G was in the last major A lineage in late 2021, A.2.5. Furthermore, mutations found to increase fitness sampled as early as January 2020 in China include S H655Y (gamma, omicron, etc) and nsp5 K90R (beta). This is far from an exhaustive list, but it's two of the examples of adaptation known to be significant for over two years. Yet, an author of this manuscript appeared on one of the most listened to podcasts in the world yesterday and said, ""it was not mutating much and that's when the alarm went off that this might have come from a lab.""",2023-02-22T18:53:00,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,10.1101/2020.05.01.073262,SARS-CoV-2 is well adapted for humans.

It is a very important challenge, to develop cryo-FocusedIonBeam/ElectronTomography (cryo-FIB/ET) technology further to be able to investigate not only single cells but also patient derived tissues. The authors attempt in their manuscript to address mouse and human brain tissue by cryo-ElectronMicroscopy (cryo-EM) - tomography is aimed in the future. Several groups attempt to do cryo-FIB/ET on tissue with different technical and sample preparation techniques. In our recent review [Bäuerlein & Baumeister (2021) JMB https://doi.org/10.1016/j.j... ] we address the challenges that need to be taken. In this present manuscript the authors  successfully manage a lamella preparation in brain tissue with an approach developed in 2014. Despite a technical solid approach the sample choice, retrieval and preparation are key to the molecular interpretation of cryo-EM studies! Here I see serious major issues with the sample retrieval and preparation. Besides a technical good approach, the sample preparation is at least as important, to be able to draw high resolution conclusions from the imaging data. MAJOR ISSUE 1: In the presented manuscript here, the way of preparation of human brain (post-mortem, ischemic due to long lasting anoxia (8.3h!), chemical fixation) doesn’t allow conclusive interpretations at molecular resolution - particularly not investigating neurodegeneration, which the authors project to do! In our recent review [Bäuerlein & Fernandez-Busnadiego & Baumeister, (2020) TICB https://doi.org/10.1016/j.t... ] we argue why post-mortem, anoxic brain tissue should NOT be chosen for the interpretation at high-resolution for the investigation of neurodegenerative diseases: „However, postmortem tissue is not suitable for high-resolution studies, as brain tissue is extremely sensitive to anoxia and rapidly develops into brain death due to global ischemia in the dying patient. Irreversible cerebral damage develops rapidly, leading to a drastic decrease of survival in minutes if an individual is not resuscitated [92]. Furthermore, the chance of a favorable neurological outcome of a surviving patient after 30 min of resuscitation is vanishingly low [93], indicating major neuronal damage. Substantial structural alterations, affecting most organelles and cytosolic structures, have been observed in the first minutes to hours after global ischemia [94–97]. And importantly, cerebral ischemic injury and neurodegenerative disorders share many commonalities [94]. Thus, studies using high-resolution methods on postmortem tissue [98,99] image a cellular situation in which the neurodegenerative pathologies cannot be distinguished from postmortem artifacts and should thus be taken with caution.“ Brain tissue is the most sensitive tissue to anoxia in the human body - several minutes of hypoxia (stroke, heart arrest) cause first structural changes in minutes and typically causes irreversible ischemic damage to neurons. Thus the term „excellent tissue quality“ is more than questionable, many hours of anoxia like in this study (8.3h). Since cryo-EM offers molecular resolution the condition of the sample must be strictly close-to-physiological, which can reasonably not be expected many hours under anoxic conditions. The authors conclude however an „excellent tissue quality“ with stating a tissue pH of 6.3. I wonder what the term ‚quality‘ here refers to!? Under physiological conditions the intracellular pH is narrowly buffered to typically 7.2, the cells surrounding CSF (an ultra-filtrate of the blood) is typically around 7.35. An acidosis with values below a pH of 6.8 is incompatible with life - so how can a brain tissue pH of 6.3 be interpreted as “excellent tissue quality” in terms of physiological vitality, which is essential if high-resolution interpretations want to be made? In contrast to the authors interpretation I suspect this brain sample to be seriously ischemic, degraded, acidic and simply dead, which are normal processes post-morten and thus a more than suboptimal target for high resolution analyses! And importantly, cerebral ischemic injury and neurodegenerative disorders share many commonalities [Nikonenko (2009) Anat. Rec.]. MAJOR ISSUE 2: In it’s adequate use - by cryo-fixation - cryo-EM enables the investigation of the cellular context at molecular resolution in a close-to-native state. The authors chemically fix the human post-mortem brain, which causes structural alterations at the molecular level [Gilkey & Staehelin (1986) J. Electron Microsc. Tech] and thus dissipates any of the favorable advantages of cryo-EM. In Fig 5 all panels show ‚empty‘ white spaces in the micrographs indicating precipitatation of soluble proteins on membranes and the cytoskeleton. Fig. 5 actually has an appearance almost like a dehydrated, resin embedded sample and looks quite untypical for cryo-preserved tissue. Also the contrast of these micrographs appears quite untypical for cryo-EM micrographs. The comparison of chemically fixed brain in Fig 5 to the not fixed mouse brain sample in Fig 4 visualizes the strong alterations chemical fixation introduces on the molecular level. Thus taken together the title of this Fig 5 „Ultrastructural preservation“ is likely exaggerated! MAJOR ISSUE 3: The major prerequisite for the ultrastructural preservation of intact cells and tissues is the vitrification of the biological matter. This means the absence of water-ice crystallinity. Sadly the authors offer no proof of absence of hexagonal ice crystallinity in their manuscript - this definitely is a must. In Fig 4B there are indications of crystalline water ice: corresponding black and white diffraction patterns also called Bragg diffraction patterns seem to be present here. This indicates that larger parts of the mouse brain sample might not be vitrified. MAJOR ISSUE 4: The standard way to represent microscopic data in the cryo-ET field is at least a slice of a tomographic reconstruction to not be biased by superimposing structures in the three-dimensional lamella or membranes that are only visible when looking at an angle which is near parallel to the membrane sheets. Here I am very surprised to exclusively see 2D projection images - this is very untypical and doesn’t support the fact, that the whole aimed cryo-ET pipeline works. Why is there not a single tomogram shown? The figure caption in Fig 4 claims the left panel as tomographic slices however they very much appear as simple projection micrographs. I would definitely show at least slices from 3D reconstructions and not 2D projections - this is minimal standard in the cryo-ET community. For example, conclusions drawn like in Fig 5 C) are not substantiated: How can the authors be certain in the interpretation that this structure is a ribosome-associated VESICLE without any 3D information - this might just be an ER tube extending in the z-direction which was cut off to top and bottom by FIB-milling? Besides this I am stunned to read in the methods section that for a single projection, an excessive dose of 100 e/Å^2 was necessary - this is a dose typical for an entire Tilt-series acquisition with about 30-50 projections - is that maybe the reason why a tilt-series could not be recorded to reconstruct a tomogram? MINOR POINTS: Furthermore I would love to see some typical overviews of entire lamellae - this could give a nice impression of the cellular context and also show how well the H-bar cryo-FIB preparation works. It would also be helpful for the community, if the authors share their most representative data on EMDB (Electron Microscopy Data Bank) - this is common practice in the field. CONCLUSION: Thus, in conclusion the technical approach is interesting but as lined out there are several major issues - leading the use of ischemic, post-mortem, heavily anoxic brain tissue, and chemical fixation which each separately are incompatible sample preparations for high resolution imaging as intended with cryo-ET. We emphasized the importance of the sample quality in our review in Trends in Cell Biology. Major issue with the perspective of the authors future intentions: The authors plan to do sub-tomogram averaging of post-mortem patients brains with this work-flow - a very well-meant advise: this is not going to be successful! Chemical fixation denaturates proteins which alone will make sub-tomogram averaging rather meaningless. Furthermore, the biological/medical conclusions drawn from protein functional states, concentrations, distributions and so on, will be very questionable when imaged in the dying, heavily ischemic brain (after some hours, there will likely not be a single neuron alive). Necrosis, apoptosis, breakdown of all membrane potentials and gradients, depletion of ATP, protein degradation and many more processes will be governed by this - so how does one want to separate the effects of death from disease mechanisms during the lifetime of the patient? Thus this approach needs to be profoundly reevaluated, when questions about disease mechanisms of neurological and psychiatric conditions are the target!",2023-02-22T12:31:33,felixbauerlein,Felix Bäuerlein,10.1101/2023.02.11.528064,Cryo-FIB workflow for imaging brain tissue via in situ cryo-electron microscopy,"Jiying Ning, Jill R.

For figure 1B, it might be useful to include figure S1A instead of just showing figure 1B. Before looking at S1A it was very confusing to understand why the macrophage population was said to return to baseline while myofibroblast population remained constant when the graph seemed to show both leveling off at around 10%. Looking at figure S1A helped clear up that confusion so it might be helpful to just include that in1B instead. 2. For figures 1J-1M, the results and data are very exciting, however there seemed to be a sample size of just one per time point and therefore no standard deviations were provided. The data might be more convincing if there could be a larger sample size. 3. Lastly, the idea of using both mice and pigs as model organisms seems to be a good system. However, it is a little unclear why for animals the threshold for an ""adult"" was 3 months when pigs seem to take longer to mature compared to mice.",2023-02-21T20:06:19,disqus_rHSPpImoUb,Pauline Young,10.1101/2023.01.01.522422,Circuit to target approach defines an autocrine myofibroblast loop that drives cardiac fibrosis,"Shoval Miyara, Miri Adler, Elad Bassat, Yalin Divinsky, Kfir B.

Bayesian Reduction for Amplified Quantization in UMAP Embedding results in a more granular an accurate cell identification, pointing at data pre-processing as a crucial step for continuous type of data. It would be interesting to analogously pre-process CYTOF data as we did and then compare DR algorithms. By the same token, we made available in the supplementary BRAQUE materials, in situ multiplex data, obtained with the MILAN technology ( https://www.researchsquare....), comprising 80 markers and up to more than half a million cells.

Stress is a very common public health problem, leading to numerous health concerns and reduced societal impact. For a while, it has been thought that the host immune system plays an important role in the development and progression of anxiety disorders, however, there are few studies which address this. In the same note, it is now being appreciated the link between gut and brain, through the gut-brain axis. Yet, there are limited studies which link physiological stress to gut permeability. This study aims to link the host immune system to anxious disorders, primarily looking at response to stress of mice. The authors utilized mice deficient in ɑβ T cells (TCRb-/-) and observed lowered anxiety behavior following exposure to stress. Additionally, the authors found that there is an inverse correlation between IL-22 and anxiety behavior. By injecting IL-22 into mice undergoing stress, the authors found that these IL22-injected mice exhibited lower neuronal activation in the septal area, that resulted in less stressed behavior.  As the gut is a major source of IL-22, they additionally demonstrate that stressed mice have increased gut permeability, resulting in TH17 differentiation through microbiota-stimulated IL-1β, and resultant IL-22 production.  As such, IL-22 is an attractive therapeutic target for addressing anxious disorders. Positive feedback. This study addresses a much needed topic of research, understanding how the host immune system modulates psychological anxious disorders. Through cutting edge immunostaining and sequencing techniques, the study identified specific immune molecules and how the host immune system regulates anxious behavior in specific areas of the brain. Furthermore, with the addition of experiments demonstrating the therapeutic capabilities of their findings were impressive and were much needed experiments to validate their findings. Another important element of the paper is the sheer amount of data that includes behavioral experiments, brain imaging, immunity-related parameters, and microbiome manipulations. Major Concerns It is not clear from the materials and methods whether measurements of mouse behavior have been randomized. Because handling the animals can introduce stress too, operators performing cage experiments must not know the mouse group. Additionally, more information should be provided on conditions under which behavioral tests have been performed - e.g., at night (typical time for activity of mice)? If not, perhaps experiments during night time must be repeated. There is a need to have other, more objective ways to measure stress level in animals including those treated with IL-22. For example, measuring levels of stress hormones could strengthen the argument. Some experiments need controls. For example, having some positive controls could be useful - these could include different doses of IL22 injected to see proportional changes in behavior, using known behavior-influencing (stress-reducing) drugs could help to better interpret the data. Also, the experiments with T cell transfer into T cell-deficient mice, having sham-operated animals (transfer PBS or B cells) could be a useful negative control. There does not seem to be much discussion about figure 1B. This is a major dataset, so the authors should spend more time going over what the figure is showing and how to interpret the dataset. Figure 2F -  the authors should split up the microscopy into individual channels and then do a merged image. It was difficult to view specifically where Fos was located. The authors should additionally show an unstressed mouse as a negative control to show the difference between staining. Figure 2H - Throughout the manuscript, the number of mice per treatment was 5, however, for this experiment, it was only done in duplicate. The authors do not mention this, so justification for this low of a number must be done. When the authors are talking about IL-22 suppressing neuron activation, they do not seem to mention microglia activation in the brain. León-Rodríguez et al., Nature Communications, 2022 look at microglia activation in anxiety-like behavior, so the authors should consider experiments investigating microglia activation or discuss these findings. Figure 4A - When mentioning the TLR4 reporter, in the results, it is mentioned as “microbial exposure in mice treated with our repeated mild stress paradigm”. This is not inherently true. It is simply how many TLR4 ligands (lipopolysaccharides), which have not entered circulation due to a leaky gut. The wording for this needs to be changed. The authors mention IL-1β playing a key role in this model system, however, they do not mention inflammasome activation for how IL-1β is produced. Which cell types in the gut are hypothesized to be the source of IL-1β? Could these experiments be repeated in inflammasome deficient mice (NAIP, NLRC4, or NLRP3 perhaps)? Figure 5H - The hypothesized model for the system is much appreciated, as there are many players at play. However, with the current state of the model, it is overtly simple. If the authors could have this more broad model, but have separate panels for what they believe to be occurring within the gut and brain, respectively, it would be more clear to the reader. Minor concerns Continuous line numbers would assist with the review process. It appears the line numbers start over each new page, so having the line numbers continuous could assist speed up the review process. If the authors could talk about why they chose to perform single-nuclei RNA-sequencing over bulk single-cell RNA sequencing, that would make the data/story more clear. Figure 3A - The microscopy cannot be seen on printed paper. If the authors increase the exposure, it would help with the resolution of the microscopy. Figure 4A - The TLR4 reporter needs to be discussed further. The authors do not discuss it enough for a non-expert to understand the meaning of these findings. Figure 5A - The microscopy cannot be seen on printed paper. If the authors increase the exposure, it would help with the resolution of the microscopy.",2023-02-18T16:18:05,,Guest,10.1101/2022.09.16.508224,Microbiota-stimulated Interleukin-22 regulates brain neurons and protects against stress-induced anxiety,"Anoj Ilanges, Mengyu Xia, Junmei Lu, Lei Chen, Rani Shiao, Changchun Wang, Zheyu Jin, Ru Feng, Qingqing Qi, Han Yi, Jixi Li, Marc Schneeberger, Boxun Lu, Jeffrey M.

This would be a very useful and fast method, if it could generalize to more complex designs - and if it is calibrated in terms of type-1 errors. Disclaimer: I want to highlight a conflict of interest: We are developing a julia package MixedModelsPermutations.jl - to allow permutation tests for crossed random effects. The package is already publicly available, but the accompanying paper was delayed due to parental leave. Further, the authors of the papers can’t possibly know, but, ClusterPermutationTests for MixedModels are already inofficially supported in Unfold.jl - We have presented it at VSS2021, but the approach is currently not properly tested or documented. I understand that my following comments raise questions to the core contribution of the paper. I tried to write this comment in a constructive and clear way, and I sincerely hope we can have a constructive conversation. I am happy to clarify my concerns where necessary, or even provide some simulations if something remains unclear. I think this approach has several important limitations: 1. The paper claims that “our method can be easily applied to a wide variety of experimental studies with more complex fixed structures.”.Following from this, the paper reads to me, as if this method would generalize to any crossed random effects dataset, whereas, if I understand it correctly, it is likely that it is only applicable to intercept-only crossed random effects 1 + cond + (1|subject) + (1|item). This is the only model that the author simulated and tested the data from. But EEG is commonly used with repeated-measures within subject conditions (measuring the same condition within subjects - in linguistics also within-item effects are common, e.g. using the same word in two different context / conditions). Indeed, in their applied example, the author analyse a within-subjects design, with a non-within subjects statistical model. This has very stark consequences on their type-1 errors, which will be greatly inflated (e.g. the classical paper is Barr 2013 - I recently published a blog post + interactive tool on this as well https://benediktehinger.de/...). Now one could argue, that because we are using cluster-permutation tests, we would expect this inflated type-1 error in the H0-permutations as well. But this is, as far as my intuition goes, not ensured in the PermCond permutation, and even in the PermFull, trials are permuted only within-subject, not within-items (both at the same time is difficult/impossible to do). Again inflating the type-1 error and breaking the structure mappings to random slopes/efffects. The authors argue otherwise: “Here, we limit to suggest to be parsimonious for two main reasons” - referring to the “parsimonious LMM study” by Matuscheck 2017. But importantly, Matuscheck (as I understand it) do not propose to simply go with the most simplified model. They rather argue, that simplifying a model, once it does not converge / does not have enough data support, helps more than it hurts. 2. The authors compare PermFull with PermCond. But the PermFull method is already a new method (as far as I know). For neither methods (analytical or numerical) tests of type-1 error-rates and type-2 error-rates / power (compared to gold standards) are provided, on the Single MixedModel case. If the argument is, that these permutation schemes work only by combining it with cluster-tests, then I’d similarly would like to see the numbers and comparisons. 3. The authors further make the strong claim, that permuting LMMs for cluster permutation would result in “unfeasible computational costs”. To counter this point, I reimplemented a similar permutation approach using UnfoldSim.jl, by simulating data for LMMs with their 19 channels and 50 timepoints (without the complexities of headmodel and cluster permutation test). Our LMM analysis takes ~2ms per LMM compared to their ~230ms reported in Matlab for an equivalent test. We used the Julia toolboxes Unfold.jl for EEG analysis and MixedModels.jl as the backend.

In their task, participants have to adjust their force to minimize the impact of a ball on hand motion. To look at the effect of extra-retinal signal, they added a condition where the gaze was constrained. Strong point: The results of the study are not consistent with the hypothesized model and forced the authors to revise their model. I applaud the authors for publishing this null result. Figures are good and provide information about individual datapoints. The statistical analyses are convincing. Weak points: The model is very lightly described, and it is difficult to understand how correlation across different variables could be explained by such model. Even the sign of the correlations is difficult to predict based on the description of the model. Reduction of smooth pursuit signal is done by imposing gaze fixation on a target and by adding an occluder that hides the target from view. By doing so, the authors reduced the amount of information that is available  to judge the speed/momentum of the target. Yet, this time is critical to build an estimate of target motion. For instance, acceleration signals can be estimated within 500ms but not 200ms (Bennett et al. 2007). It is unclear how long the target was visible in the freevieweing and constrained conditions. It is often unclear what are the extra-retinal signals that the authors refer to. Is it an efference copy of eye movements, is it an internal representation of target motion? Is it something else? Eye fixation allows the authors to get rid of efference copy but does not prevent the participants from building an internal representation of target motion. Many non-significant p-values are interpreted as absence of effects (even when p=0.07). Yet, this is not the case. The authors have a very limited sample size and it is difficult to draw any conclusion from the absence of an effect in such case. The wording should be revised accordingly. Looking at Fig. 2C, it seems that the gaze speed is still contaminated by many saccades as smooth eye velocity cannot reach values as high as 200 deg/s. This might have to do with the fact that the authors first low-pass filtered their data at 15Hz and then detected the saccades. Desaccaded eye velocity trace can best be obtained by using an acceleration threshold on an unfiltered signal (de Brouwer and Lefevre, 2000 and 2001) Minor comments Fig. 3: it is unclear why the authors do not report the evolution of other variables such as APF or RDF over the course of learning. Is the decrease in variability due to lower force rate and less signal dependent noise? Fig.5A: TOFO is defined as distance of the target when anticipatory force starts to increase divided by target speed. Given this definition, it seems very logical that TOFO would be influenced by target speed. Experiment 2: How similar remain the correlations reported in Fig.4 in experiment 2 when the gaze is constrained? Possible improvements: p.21 “Thus, the hand force during contact may be largely determined by feedforward control and intrinsic viscoelastic properties of muscles” is important but not highlighted enough.

Yong Cao and I had several rounds of discussion on the issues you raised. Your suggestions and comments are italicized. We will follow up as more results come out. We discussed your manuscript in our lab and enjoyed its balanced tone and inquisition of an important aspect of the search. Thank you for sharing your search parameters for xiSEARCH and as a developer of that tool I second your choice of parameters completely. However, to answer the question “STY or not STY?” your current search experiment seems insufficient to us for reasons detailed below, and we would like to suggest a number of controls and changes. When allowing either KSTY or KGVL you disregard an important element of link assignment based on the often-incomplete MS data. Indeed, the MS2 data often do not unambiguously assign the linked residue by neighbouring backbone fragments and the likely link site is chosen based on the predefined chemistry of the linker. Fig 2G is a nice example of this. Depending on what you define as chemical preference of the crosslinker, you either report S or G. In all those cases, any residue is equally likely based on the MS data and your linker definition determines the reported site. If STY are disregarded and the abundant GVL are pre-defined, obviously, they will be reported. To put this to an extreme, why do you not disregard K as a link possibility and only allow GVL? We would like to suggest a couple of changes to your experiment: (1) To determine if STY are targets of NHS crosslinkers, only evaluate sites that were reported unambiguously based on MS data, i.e, with neighbouring fragments. Maybe run a completely indiscriminate crosslinker and look for enriched amino acids. Open modification search analyses linear peptides which differ from crosslinked peptides in not having a second reaction step in a spatially confined setting. The first reaction of a crosslinker brings it into the protein, the second reaction takes place with a spatially proximal residue of appropriate chemistry. The second step can only be assessed by looking into crosslinked peptides. Reply #1: These are good points.  Evaluating only the sites that are reported unambiguously based on MS data is an excellent idea, but doing it requires a software tool to filter out such CSMs. Unfortunately, we do not have such a tool. Do you know if anyone has such a tool? About running a completely indiscriminate crosslinker, we are wondering what will go into this. Do you suggest that we search, for example, a DSS dataset as if DSS could react with any amino acid and see what happens? Or, to do a new wet-lab experiment with a completely indiscriminate cross-linker? What cross-linker would it be? Not sure if photoactivated cross-linkers are truly completely indiscriminate. It’s unclear to us what question this experiment aims to address. (2) To determine if the data support STY as well or as poorly as the chemically meaningless GVL, define a linker KSTYGVL to let STY and GVL compete. Note that xiSEARCH currently will take the more C-terminal residue in any ambiguity window and thus have some random component in link site assignment. If an ambiguity window contains a K near STY, xiSEARCH has a preference setting for K, though. Consequently, if a STY is reported in favour of a nearby K, there must be supporting MS2 evidence in the spectrum for this report. Reply #2: Thanks for this suggestion. We conducted the KSTYGVL experiment on Ribo-DSSO dataset. As shown below ( Fig. Reply #2), the pLink search result and the xiSearch search result are very similar to each other. Once again, the identified GVL-cross-links outnumbered those of STY-cross-links, agreeing with the results obtained from separate KSTY and KGVL searches. (3) Do the GVL linker experiment (no KSTY). I would expect you to find many crosslinked peptides, nearly all the same peptide pairs as with K or KSTY. Reply #3: We conducted the GVL-only search and the STY-only search and compared the identification results with K-only (K and protein N-term) search at the sequence pair level. Namely, if two pairs of cross-linked peptides—one from the GVL- or STY-only search and the other from the K-only search—involve the same pair of peptides irrespective of the link sites, they are regarded as a match (peptide sequence IDs are consistent). This analysis showed that 56-60% of the GVL- or STY-only search results overlapped with the K-only search (see Vienn diagrams below, Fig. Reply #3). However, 39.5% of cross-links IDed from the GVL-only search are unique, suggesting that they contain false peptide sequence IDs. Similarly, 44.1% of cross-links IDed from the STY-only search are unique. As the two percentages—39.5% and 44.1%—are close, we conclude that if some of the STY cross-links are correct, they should be few. This agrees with the results of all the other analyses conducted in this study. (4) Do KYST versus KGVL and match the YST with the GVL peptides where the are the identical peptide matches and compare the score. Plot a 2D scatter plot with score(YST) versus score(GVL). My expectation is that you will have many equal scoring peptides (ambiguity window based on insufficient MS2 data) and many cases where the score(YST) will be larger. Reply #4: Good advice—thank you! We made two scatter plots, one for the pLink search result and one for xiSearch (shown below, Fig. Reply #4). For most pairs, we see nearly identical scores. Occasionally, a STY-cross-link may score better or worse than its cognate GVL-cross-link. In Supplementary Figure 4C, we present a well-matched spectrum for a K-V cross-link. In this spectrum, one can find evidence from fragment ions for α16(V) being the link site instead of the adjacent α15(K). To us, this example shows that accidental match does happen, for GVL-cross-links as well as for STY-cross-links. As a final note, link site assignment is currently an open issue of crosslinking, and you are right to point this out. Curiously, speaking to Jan Kosinski as a modeller, he did not care about link sites at all. Our own work on using photo-crosslinking (where link site assignment is even more problematic because of the wider reactivity) did not show difference in protein structure model quality using link sites with a +/- 5 residue scatter (PMID: 26385339). So far, it seems to be unclear if link site precision offers any structural value. I hope it does… albeit it might not, considering the length of NHS crosslinkers and the flexibility of proteins. From a mass spectrometry side I would, nonetheless, prefer to see link sites reported with a measure of precision. Reply #5: We agree with you on this for the most part. The third paragraph of the discussion section of our manuscript conveys a message that echoes much of what you have said above. Namely, Category I and Category II STY-cross-links, which are actually K-K cross-links and K-mono-links that are misidentified as K-STY cross-links or in rare cases as STY-STY cross-links, are of little harm. However, some Category III STY-cross-links could be misleading in serious ways, because they involve falsely identified peptides. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us, and for inviting us to think more. We have enjoyed this discussion and we look forward to exchanging more ideas with you.

I learned a lot from it, and really enjoyed your research. Overall, I thought your focus was fascinating and your flow of ideas from one question the next was clear and significant. Here are a few more specific constructive comments I had (and comments from my classmates), and I'll try not to repeat my classmate! These comments are only to help, so I hope they do; sorry if my comments are just due to myself misunderstanding the data, but hopefully they can call for clarity. 1) For the flow cytometry data in Fig 1A, we discussed possibly having a positive control to give us a visual of how your results show the resulted significance. How about a foxp3-coded bead for the positive control? 2) For Fig 1, like my classmate said, the experimental methods were unclear why you chose the male sex for the mice, especially when you used female mice to donate WT Tregs later in Fig 3 to both sexes? Explaining your reasoning for these choices, and controlling for sex could be more clear. 3) For Fig 1B and 1D, it might be helpful to include transformed data as well as the untransformed data to see the statistically transformed significance. 4) For immunofluorescence imaging in Fig. 2, 4, and 5 like mentioned the stain colors (dark blue and light blue together) is confusing, and the grey stain is basically impossible to see. 5) Furthermore, though you specified sample size, it is unclear if they are samples from the same mice or different mice... if it was the former, then it would actually  be n=1. Just being specific about this would clear up this uncertainty. 6) For figure 3, you put adoptively transferred Tregs into both male and female mice which gives an extra category of sex to your data, along with the category of aged v. young Tregs. You need to account for this category in your data to ensure reliability in your resulting significance. A 2-way ANOVA might be more appropriate over a 1-way ANOVA. 7) Showing significance bars/stars on Fig 3D and 3H would be consistent and helpful. 8) Would be helpful to include the FDR in subfig 4 9). The volcano plot in 4B is extremely pixilated and the reader cannot zoom in to a clear figure to analyze. 10) The sample sizes are variable, and for some of the small sample sizes, it is unclear if there is a large enough effect size for these to be meaningful. Maybe running a power analysis could clarify this. Thank you for reading, and hopefully these comments can help.

Tissue-resident macrophage are cells playing an important role in homeostasis of tissues by removing dying cells as well as responding to local exposures to microbes. The origin of tissue-resident macrophages has been under intense investigation; studies primarily done in laboratory mice suggest that some macrophages (e.g., microglia) are derived from yolk sac during embryonic development while other macrophages (e.g., in the gut) are primarily derived from circulating in the blood monocytes. Laboratory mice are typically kept in clean conditions with little to no exposure to many pathogens, and whether the conclusions found studies with mice extend to other animals including humans remains unclear. This study takes an advantage of using GFP-expressing hematopoietic stem cell (HPSC) transplantation of monkeys with barcoded stem cells to track the dynamics of barcoded, bone marrow-derived cells in the tissues. Interestingly, the authors found that macrophages in liver, spleen/LN, and GI tract have high frequency of the GFP expressing cells and suggesting high turnover of these tissue-resident macrophages from bone marrow-derived precursors. Authors performed several additional analyses to ensure robustness of their findings including imaging of GFP-expressing macrophages, analysis of barcode sequences between different bone marrow-derived T cells, and using classical pulse-chase experiments to detect division of macrophages in the tissues. Positive feedback. The study is a timely addition to the debate on the origins of tissue-resident macrophages in animals that live in environments with larger exposure to environmental antigens. The use of barcoded bone marrow-derived cells to track origin of cells in the peripheral tissues is innovative and interesting. The analysis of imaging data to ensure that GFP-expressing macrophages are not phagocytosing other cells is important, and PCA analysis of the barcodes is important to establish relatedness between different cell types. Labeling with BrdU is also a useful way to look at cell turnover that had been forgotten and may be revived by this study. Yet, because of some missing controls and not fully rigorous analysis of the data the conclusion that tissue-resident macrophages in monkeys undergo relatively rapid replacement from bone marrow-derived cells remains to be determined. Major Concerns It seems that several controls are missing in the paper. In particular, having the data in which samples are done very early after HPSC transplantation would be very important - it is expected that no GFP+ cells would be then found in tissues - so, presenting data for GFP+ cells (e.g., for key populations) as these change over time would be most useful for interpretation (some of that is present with barcodes but comes too late in the paper). This is a major limitation of the study that does not allow to fully interpret the data. Most tissues are filled with blood. How do you know that you did not sample cells in the blood that have features of macrophages (e.g., MHCII+)? Work with serial intravascular staining by Mario Roederer’s group clearly showed contamination of tissue samples (e.g., LNs) by blood-derived cells (PMID: 33441422). Some type of control is needed (e.g., intravascular staining). Are these “myeloid cells” macrophages? Can the authors show some other types of data, e.g., imaging that clearly identifies those isolated cells as macrophages? Gut-resident macrophages are known to be primarily monocyte-derived, so for these cells, finding high frequency of GFP+ cells is not surprising. What about brain-associated macrophages in monkeys? Are these HPSC-derived? (In mice, they seem to be yolk sac-derived). Another site to look at may be skin and other skin cells (e.g., Langerhans cells?) It is hard to interpret what the data on percent of GFP+ cells mean. For example, if one finds 20% of cells with irradiation of monkeys in 2-3 months after transplantation, what does this suggest in terms of kinetics of macrophage turnover? It seems that the authors would benefit from some type of mathematical modeling-based analysis to generate a baseline prediction on expectations. PCA analysis lacks rigor. Finding that some points are “clustered” and some are not must be done with some statistical tests. For example, resampling the data and reclustering may provide some evidence of robustness of clusters. Interpretation of BrdU data can be made better.  There have been a wealth of mathematical models aim at inferring cell division and death rates from pulse chase experiments (e.g., 9469816, 10799860, 12737664, 23034350), perhaps authors could use those methods to provide some boundaries of the macrophage division rate and/or differentiation-from-monocyte rates. Also, including some data - if available - on labeling during pulse dynamics - could be very informative. A comparison to some other cells that we know do not have long residency time in tissues may be useful - e.g., neutrophils. THese are thought to be relatively short-lived cells in the blood (but this is again debated) and in the tissues. What is the GFP/barcode kinetics in neutrophils? Minor concerns Authors should better describe experimental design and specifically sampling details. For example, Fig 1A does not fully explain when the animals were sampled. Is 46m is the time of 1st sample for JM82? Is 49m when the animal was sacrificed? Only looking at Fig 3 it is possible to see sampling times but this is too late in the paper. Captions must be improved to explain that all and be more detailed. There are sometimes too generic statements that may not be fully supported by the presented data, e.g., turnover of ALL macrophages being rapid (e.g., last paragraph in Discussion). Yet, authors only sampled some tissues. Paper organization could be improved. For example, it is easier to review the paper when figures and figure captions are located on the same page. Numbering the lines in the paper can help to provide comments to specific parts of the paper. Better formatting of the references would be helpful - .e.g, more space between individual entries or numbering the entries. Figure 2D could include control with macrophages that may carry high levels of of TCRg, e.g., from the thymus. Figure 2 figure legend could be more descriptive about which panels are representative of which sample Figure 2 could have info on the tissues where samples were coming from (e.g., Macrophage/liver), etc. GFP staining in these images is hard to interpret - perhaps adding a membrane stain and DAPI (nuclear stain) could help to tell that GFP is in the cytoplasm. Table 1 could also include symbols/shapes used in graphs to identify animals. Would be very interesting to see spleen confocal to compare macrophages and their GFP staining - will them have the scattered signal due to taking up dying cells? Adding shapes used in Figure 1A &D to differentiate each group to Table 1 would be helpful It may be useful to discuss potential reasons for macrophage dynamics differences between mice and monkeys - is that because species are different or because they live in different environments. Would experiments in dirty mice be useful to tell if the environment is what is the main driver of (perhaps) different macrophage dynamics in some tissues? For necropsied animals, is it possible to show data for macrophages in tissues that show little evidence of link to hematopoietic system (e.g., microglia)? It may be useful to more thoroughly discuss the efficiency of lentivirus infection. Does this efficiency impact interpretation of GFP/barcode dynamics, e.g., does one need to normalize the data in some way? The number of samples per time point (e.g., Fig 5) is varied per animal and tissue. Perhaps some justification of this could be useful. In Figure 3, would it be possible to better describe how to interpret the PCA plots? Also, it would be good to use other colors besides green and red as green-red color blindness is the most common form.",2023-02-11T22:49:23,vitalyvganusov,Vitaly V.

It is particularly interesting to see a low-risk experimental framework to quickly evaluate some of the risks posed by possible future recombination when diverse variants are co-circulating. I am curious about the rationale to define ""Delta"" as 90% GISAID consensus for B.1.617.2 and define ""Omicron"" as 90% consensus for BA.1. Omicron by this definition is a genome that has been observed, but it is unclear that Delta as defined in Fig 3A has been observed, with a previous report defining 5 Delta clades [1] that each include multiple non-synonymous ORF1a mutations. Are we sure that Delta as defined here was ""naturally occuring"" and that, if it was, how relevant is this genome to those previously compared to Omicron? Specifically with respect to nsp6, Delta sequences include one of H11Q, T77A,  or V149A (the latter with or without T181I). Notably, nsp6 T77A is defining for B.1.617.1. Searching COV-SPECTRUM for March-May 2021, 39,726 sequences include Delta consensus mutations in Fig 3a. There are 21 sequences within that set with nsp6 lacking any of these mutations and brief examination of placements on the UShER tree indicate imperfect sequences (reversions, etc). Additionally, Omicron BA.2/3/4/5 have nsp6 differing from that in BA.1, but the same as that observed in previous variants (e.g. alpha, beta, and gamma). It would be very interesting to see apples-to-apples comparisons of these nsp6 and hopefully this methodology can help unravel the significance of recurrent nsp6 deletions and subsequent nsp6 adaptation in future work. While Delta lineages were eventually dominated by those containing nsp6 T77A (~97% by the end of 2021), a Delta lineage with nsp6 V149A/T181I contributed its nsp6 to the XBC lineage, with derivative lineages adding nsp6 I50T. This is one of the few ""Deltacron"" lineages with a Delta nsp6 and may be of special interest. Lastly, Fig 3A does not include S:G142D in its definition of Delta; absence in over 10% of sequences is a dropout artifact [2]. [1] Stern et al. medRxiv 2021. https://www.medrxiv.org/con...

We selected your paper to read as part of our Journal Club seminar for the Biomedical Research Minor at UCLA. First of all, thank you so much for sharing your research; this was a fantastic paper and I learned a lot from it. I wanted to share some of the feedback we discussed during the seminar in the hope that some of it may be useful! 1) We were curious how you chose the sex of the mice to be used in each experiment, as it doesn't seem to be consistent throughout. Also, what were your inclusion/exclusion criteria for the young and aged mice cohorts? 2) Fig. 1: Very minor, but in Fig. 1I the image itself has 14dpl in the title but 10dpl in the figure legend. 3) Fig. 2: The pseudocoloring is really difficult to see, especially with DAPI as blue, OLIG2 as cyan, and CNP as grey. It could potentially be easier to see if OLIG2 and CNP could be changed to yellow and green. Also, for Fig. 2G, it would be helpful to clarify whether the cerebellar slices included in the sample size of n=7 are from the same mice or from different mice. 4) Fig. 3: We were curious if you had also considered doing the reverse experiment (young Treg injected into aged Treg-depleted mice). 5) Fig. 4-5 (and throughout the paper): We were wondering if you had done power analyses for this study given the highly variable sampling throughout the paper. For instance, it seemed like there were over 10 mice used in some experiments and as few as 3 in others, so we were curious about the reasoning behind these decisions. Overall, though, this paper was really informative and exciting to read!

The authors present a lot of data and the results about temperature-dependent PapR maturation reveal new information about the mechanisms underlying quorum-sensing in these bacteria. However, in my opinion, the conclusions regarding expression heterogeneity are based on data that present a major flaw. Plasmid pHT315 is not appropriate for the measurement of fluorescence intensity because it induces heterogeneity in itself, probably because of its copy number. The authors should have verified this by using a control such as the promoter of a constitutively-expressed gene. They would have seen the same kind of result as they see with PlcR-regulated genes. Plasmid pHT304 should have been used instead. The reference for plasmid pHT315 is wrong. It should be Arantes and Lereclus Gene. 108 (1991)115-l 19. The difference in cell morphology between strains that only differed by the reporter fusion they carry is also puzzling (chains or filaments, it's difficult to say, versus individualized cells ; Figure 2).

This hypothesis is purely based on the fitting of atomic models in the extra densities. No experimental evidence to support this hypothesis is provided. The idea that RNA assembles together with amyloids has been proposed; the new contribution here is the fitting of atomic models. But, because of disorder and a possible mismatch with the imposed helical symmetry, the quality of the extra densities is generally poor. Therefore, the potential fit of atomic models of molecules in these densities is not enough evidence to conclude that such molecules are responsible for these densities. More experimental data will be needed to find out what molecules are responsible for these extra densities, which would have potentially important implications for our understanding of these diseases.",2023-02-07T09:28:11,sjors_scheres,Sjors Scheres,10.1101/2023.02.01.526613,RNA as a component of fibrils from Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerations,Leslie R.

James is posting it on behalf of the author (who wishes to remain anonymous) to provide additional background context on the issue of how Orf3a could be misidentified as an ion channel. This paper is welcome because the biophysical aspects of previous viroporin work are problematic. The virology and other aspects of those works are presumably technically correct. But this speaks to the problems of silos, and that at some point virology and biophysics really need to sit down and have a talk. Below, I highlight how the papers from the virology labs are weak in the biophysical aspects. Consequently, the field is replete with exceedingly poorly executed and reviewed biophysics work that has proven to be irreproducible. A nice review  ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... by Colin Nichols and Conor McClenaghan outlines the problems with the interpretations in previous work using bilayers, oocytes or mammalian cells. This paper by Miller/Clapham sets the record straight with regard to SARS CoV 2 protein 3a. It builds on Steve Grant in Henry Lester's lab at Caltech work ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih..., which has shown that there is no evidence for 3a forming functional channels in oocyte plasma membranes. The Grant/Lester paper did a nice control using Spike and nsp2, which have never been claimed to have ion channel activity. These papers are necessary because of previous, poor-quality papers, which claimed channel activity. For example, Toft-Bertelsen et al. ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go... suggested that 3a was an ion channel.  This paper claimed that numerous other viral accessory proteins - 7 or 8 of them also acted as ion channels, which prompted some skepticism in the field. That paper lacked important controls (e.g. no controls for proteins known not to be an ion channel, like Spike as done in the Grant/Lester paper). The major issue is that it was not properly controlled for the issue of endogenous background channels, sadly ( which is should be pointed out by reviewers as electrophysiology 101). Importantly, the Toft-Bertelsen work didn't even demonstrate that the proteins were in the plasma membrane. Without engineering the expression construct, it is almost certainly all in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, ERGIC). Sixteen biophysicists recently commented in Communications Biology ( https://www.nature.com/arti... on the shortcomings of the Todt-Bertelsen paper, explained several possible sources of artifact, and outlined experimental steps that could be followed to claim ion channel function. There are also papers on the E and 3a proteins that use only bilayer recordings. Two papers on SARS-CoV-1 from the Enjaunes lab show channel records that are scaled multiples of one another. In other words, the E channel (Figure 3a of Verdia-Baguena https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...) and the 3a channels (Figure 3 of Castaño-Rodriguez https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...) appear to be exact scaled copies of the same trace. This example has no rational explanation, but it is illustrative of the problems in the field. It doesn't reflect well on the reviewers and editors of those papers. An example of the steps for Ion channel function being met is observed for the E protein, which is likely to be a channel similar to the M2 of influenza ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go.... Problematic aspects of other previous studies contrasting E and 3a are also reviewed here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go.... The structure of Orf3a is described by Kern et al ( https://www.nature.com/arti.... Key evidence for the channel function is provided by its sensitivity to ruthenium red, which blocks quite a few ubiquitous channels including those found in intracellular organelles. This results provide the main reason for skepticism of an Orf3a-specific result for this due to the high protein ratios. It is possible this is real, but it is unproven. One should keep in mind that ions can get across membranes in multiple ways, so this doesn't have to be by conduction? The current Miller et al manuscript ( https://www.biorxiv.org/con... ) argues strongly against Orf3a channel function and provides an explanation for the results in Kern et al. Miller et al, only saw channels in proteoliposome patch-clamp recordings under the highest protein conditions used. These channel recordings were sensitive to DIDS and therefore likely to be due to contamination by VDAC or something similar.",2023-02-06T22:17:47,fraserlab,Fraser Lab,10.1101/2022.09.02.506428,"The SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf3a is not an ion channel, but does interact with trafficking proteins","Alexandria N.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.02.514751v1#comment-6109000141,biorxivstage,2,"Cryo-crystallography is one of the most common techniques used in x-ray data collection of macromolecules. This is because cryogenically freezing crystals helps minimize radiation damage and extend crystal lifetime which allows for complete data sets collected from single crystals. However, proteins are not rigid and exist as a conformational ensemble. This is relevant for studying protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions because some binding/interaction sites may require alternative side-chain conformations or subtle backbone changes that may be inaccessible under cryogenic conditions due to shifting the energy landscape. In this paper, the authors sought to address the protein-ligand interactions at room temperature (RT) by performing a large crystallographic fragment screen. They utilized the therapeutic target PTP1B using 2 RT screens which consist primarily of fragments that have been tested previously at cryogenic temperatures. The main outcome of this paper reveals novel ligand binding poses in allosteric sites which is relevant for understanding allosteric mechanisms, however, at RT relatively fewer weakly-binding fragments are found. Along with this, a new fragment-binding site is also reported in the paper - importantly this site was identified at RT, but not by any fragments at cryo temperature. The last section of the paper also describes the identification of a fragment bound to the Lys197 of the allosteric site. The binding pose of the fragment at this position is similar to a covalent inhibitor to the mutant protein. The major strength of this paper is demonstrating that RT screening has the potential to reveal additional allosteric binding sites that may otherwise be inaccessible at cryogenic temperatures. The major limitation of this paper is the low coverage of chemical space due to focusing on previous fragments that were detected under cryo conditions and could be strengthened with a broader screen of chemical space for fragments that were not previously tested. Further, the lower hit rate compared to cryo screening may limit the utility of RT screening in a structure based drug-design approach. The paper is written concisely with a clear focus on the comparison of fragment binding at RT and cryo temperatures, however lacking few things which we would like to highlight below: Major points: In Figure 5, the authors point out that cryo and RT fragments can bind at the same site but in different poses to suggest relevance in allosteric inhibitor design but don’t fully explore the chemical rationale for alternate binding poses. It would be beneficial if the authors could describe the environment around the alternate binding poses to potentially explain if both conformations are relevant or if one is more likely than the other. In Figure 6A, the authors claim that a previously modeled cryo pose does not correspond well with the RT event map, however we feel that the event map appears to plausibly support both conformations. The only conclusion we can draw from here is the presence of water molecule in cryo and not in RT density. It may be worthwhile to try paired refinement to determine if the absence of the water at RT is due to resolution differences between the two data sets. In Figure 7A, the authors claim that the RT event map supports a flipped pose for fragments compared to cryo, however, the cryo event map is ambiguous and the absence of density (owing to lower resolution for this dataset at cryo?) suggest that the cryo ligand may be modeled incorrectly. Minor: Fig S4-H: Does the RT event map support alternate conformation for the fragment/ too ambiguous? Or is it a case of a new binding pose at the same site? In Figure 8A: 38A in legend or 40A in text? In Figure 9, the authors explain that the isatin-based fragment is covalently linked to Lys197 at RT but not cryo and suggest that the absence of this fragment from cryo may be due to insufficient soaking. It seems reasonable to follow up this “cryo-non-hit” by examining the effect soaking duration has on ligand binding for cryo. The manuscript would also benefit from a chemical schematic showing the covalent mechanism. NOTE - This paper was selected by the lab members for a group discussion. JSF was the postdoctoral advisor of Keedy and graduate advisor for Biel, who are authors on this paper - and is acknowledged in the manuscript for helpful discussions prior to posting the preprint.

I have a suggestion if you are going to be modelling more variants in the future. I have developed a PCR based method to identify engineered missense variants and this is faster/cheaper/easier than using restriction digest. Essentially you design a PCR primer that is complementary to the engineered mutations and this will specifically amplify in the mutant. Typically there are 3-6 mutations (missense + silent) in this region so it is specific enough to not amplify wild-type. I detail this approach in Supplemental Figure 1 of this paper https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.046631,2023-02-04T09:14:39,KarenL_PhD,Karen Lange,10.1101/2023.01.07.523106,A humanized Caenorhabditis elegans model of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia-associated variants in kinesin light chain KLC4,"Selin Gümüşderelioğlu, Lauren Resch, Trisha Brock, Undiagnosed Diseases Network, G.W.

Some figures exceeding 80% appear in the literature. As is mentioned in the article, these parasite forms are known as ""hypnozoites"", a term I coined 45 years ago [1]. This hypnozoitophilic dogma is, entirely logically, based on extrapolation from the results of drug treatment of patients with P. vivax malaria. However, the idea does not make sense to me parasitologically. It is not necessarily correct, for reasons explained elsewhere [2,3]. The point is that a proportion of relapse-like P. vivax malarial recurrences might originate from concealed merozoites (a recently confirmed parasite reservoir), as opposed to hypnozoites [3]. The suggestion was originally made 12 years ago [4]. It is not so much a question of why would these merozoites be a source of recrudescent P. vivax malaria but, rather, why would they not be? Luckily, evidence one way or the other should soon be forthcoming from drug-related experimentation using humanized mice [2]. Following on from the novel research concerning inhibition of hypnozoite and hepatic schizont activity that is reported in this bioRxiv paper, perhaps the authors could consider investigating, in addition, what might inhibit non-circulating P. vivax asexual stages (they did include P. falciparum blood stages in their study), such as occur in vast numbers in bone marrow and the spleen. I.e. if feasible. These hidden merozoites may be responsible for numerous clinical malarial episodes and it is possible that they are at least as problematic as hypnozoites. But this remains to be determined. REFERENCES: 1. Markus MB. 2011. The hypnozoite concept, with particular reference to malaria.

We selected your paper to discuss in our undergraduate Journal Club seminar and I wanted to share some of the thoughts and suggestions that came up as we were discussing it. Firstly, thank you for sharing your science and for posting it here! The subject matter of this paper was extremely interesting, and we all enjoyed reading your paper. The background information was presented in a manner that was clear, concise, and detailed; this allowed us (non-experts) to easily engage with your research. Additionally, we came up with some suggestions for your paper: 1)	In Figure 5, we thought it might be nice to present the gene-network and GSEAs in another format. For individuals that are not familiar with these types of analyses, it is rather difficult to infer what’s going on within the figure from just the paper alone. Therefore, an alternative presentation of the data (perhaps in a table or heatmap format) may make it even more accessible. 2)	It seems that the same control was used within Figure 3 and 4 (as the control brain image is the same across both figures); therefore, we suggest that these be combined into one large figure. 3)	Additionally, we noted that single-end RNA sequencing was employed; however, due to the limitations with this technique, in terms of reconstructing transcripts, it may be nice to repeat this experiment with pair-end RNA sequencing. Single-cell RNA sequencing would be even better than pair-end RNA sequencing; however, we acknowledge the immense cost of this technique. 4)	In terms of the RNA experiments, we suggest that the average length of transcripts be noted within the methods section as this would give the reader an indication of the quality of transcripts. 5)	Lastly, we also suggest that the plunger plots within Figure 2 be replaced with a violin plot or a box and whisker plot. We suggest this because within Figure 2b, you can see that there is a lot of variation within the Core group. This variation would be best illustrated with a different plot type and would provide a reader with a visualization of the skew in the data. Overall, we really enjoyed reading this paper and thank you for sharing it here",2023-02-02T20:04:27,francescaday,Francesca Day,10.1101/2023.01.10.523434,Spatial distribution and functional relevance of FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression for glioblastoma tumor invasion,"Nawal Alshahrany, Ana Jimenez-Pascual, Florian A Siebzehnrubl",2023-01-10

I enjoyed reading your paper which intrigued me so much. I have some experience with glioblastoma, so knowing more about them are helpful for me. After reading through the paper, I like how you are bringing ideas on the frontline. From your paper, I learned that FGFR1 and 2 are expressed in both in vitro and in vivo but may have spatial heterogeneity in regions of tumor, also FGFR receptors have antagonist effect on tumor prognosis or potentially on invasion. I also like how the networks presented in the last figure yield some more interesting markers that could be studies further. Here is something I like about this paper: 1.	The paper uses clear languages and explanation that could be easily understand. 2.	I like how you incorporate xenograft model for in vivo study. 3.	I like how you incorporate different types of controls: loading control and positive control ShCo on WB and validation of antibodies / xenograft models. 4.	Additionally, I like how you refer back to in vitro study in your paper, while also mentioning the in vivo results. Here is something I think you could think further / consider for improvements. 1.	For figure 1, even though you test the antibodies and xenograft model, it is interesting that you put failed antibody as your first panel. I don’t usually see this in published papers, I think putting these failed ones in supplementary details are better. 2.	For figure 2, I think the way data is presented could be improved. From my perspective, the data wasn’t normally distributed, thus using mean and standard deviation, as well as plunger plots, are not good graphical choices. Better choices are violin plots and box-and whisker plots, since they show variance and raw data distribution (whether it is skewed). 3.	For study design, you mentioned that you measured percentage of FCFRs in vitro in your previous paper, would you consider also measuring the amount of FCFRs in vivo models? It might be interesting to compare how much percentage of cells express in vivo model, which may provide insights on whether targeting these receptor is good for regulating/inhibiting global tumor invasion. 4.	For figure 3 and 4, I think you also use the same control for both, which may be better to combine into one figure. Otherwise, two sets of control should be used, as the condition may have changed as you run the experiments at different times. I think using ANOVA here would be better. I am also wondering why brain slices shown are incomplete, I think for publication quality, it would be better to put full brain slice in the panel. 5.	For figure 5, I think it is hard to interpret it without some experience with bulk-rnaseq. I hope it could be explained better in the results or method section. Also, putting software generated figures is not a wise choice, because it is not annotated. I think it would be better to make your own plots, or flowchart to show how they work for clarity. My collogue also pointed out the lack of FGFR2 data here, despite it being nonsignificant. 6.	The supplementary figure is extremely blurry, which is hard to read. Overall, thank you for doing the research and sharing it here. Love the passion and hope to see more research on this. I hope my comment somewhat helps to discern some confusion from someone with a bit of cancer experience.",2023-02-02T19:51:11,disqus_3CuY4i52sl,Oliver Xu,10.1101/2023.01.10.523434,Spatial distribution and functional relevance of FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression for glioblastoma tumor invasion,"Nawal Alshahrany, Ana Jimenez-Pascual, Florian A Siebzehnrubl",2023-01-10

This immune function of DCL2 is independent of its canonical function in RNA interference through small RNA. The strength of the study is in the genetic dissection of the autoimmune phenotype caused by DCL2 that was previously described in literature. The authors use phenotypic analysis combined with RNA sequencing in Arabidopsis to show that DCL2 triggers activation of immunity and an autoimmune phenotype through at least two NLR proteins (L5 and RPP9). This is a novel and important discovery. They show that this activity is cytoplasmic and not nuclear. Interestingly, immunity is also activated in tomato by DCL2 and moss by DCL3, suggesting this mechanism is evolutionarily highly conserved. These conclusions are well supported by data and well presented. However, the evidence for an antiviral function of this pathway is not sufficient for the strong claims made in this paper. References to virus are made in the title, the abstract, results and conclusions, and are an important part of the paper, so major concerns need to be addressed. These are listed below, with suggested experiments. -	The virus infection results are not conclusive. For example, in Fig 4A dcl4/l5 line 1 shows more virus accumulation than dcl4/l5 line 2 (which in turn accumulates as much virus as the dcl4 single mutant), while in Fig 4B the opposite is true. In fact, in Fig 4B the l5 mutation is not additive to dcl4 mutation in terms of antiviral defense. In Fig 4B the dcl2 mutant shows significantly less accumulation than WT, which is not the case in Fig 4A and in literature. All this points to high stochastic variability between samples, which can be expected when working with pathogens. It is highly appreciated that the authors show conflicting results between experiments, but these results need to be robust given their importance for the conclusions of the paper. One possible explanation for this variability could be the use of labile in vitro transcripts as inoculum. This could be solved by either randomizing the plants when infecting (not one genotype after the other, if this wasn’t done) and/or use systemically infected tissues from inoculated dcl2/dcl4 mutants as inoculum for rub inoculation (although this TCV clone has no CP, which could be a problem). In any case, the infection experiments need to be repeated with more biological replicates per genotype, in the key genotypes Col, dcl4, l5, rpp9, dcl4/l5, dcl4/rpp9. -	A VSR-impaired virus should not be used to test whether DCL2 has an RNAi-independent function. As this virus is very sensitive to RNAi, in this experimental setup this pathway cannot be uncoupled from the proposed dsRNA-DCL2-NLR sensing pathway. In addition, the P38 VSR is also the viral coat protein, loss of which could impact the viral life cycle and accessibility of dsRNA structures in vivo. On the other hand, the use of wild-type TCV, encoding a very efficient VSR, would reliably show whether DCL2 has a small RNA/AGO-independent antiviral function. In this case WT, dcl4, l5 and rpp9 should show similar levels of virus accumulation, while dcl4/l5 and dcl4/rpp9 should show increased accumulation, if the hypothesis is valid. As above, several replicates should be analyzed. -	A central conclusion in this paper is that DCL2 is a sensor of dsRNA that activates innate immunity through NLRs. While the fact that DCL2 is an RNAseIII strongly suggests that it senses dsRNA, there is limited experimental evidence for this (the knock-out of RNA decay factors in literature and the experiments with TCV-deltaP38 - see comments above). Two experimental approaches would significantly strengthen these conclusions. (1) Treatment with a dsRNA analogue such as poly I:C of the various dcl/NLR mutants described in the paper. Activation of immunity can be assessed by quantifying expression of immune-responsive genes as in Supplementary Figure 1 or as described in literature (DOI: 10.1111/pbi.13327, DOI: 10.1042/EBC20210100). Performing this experiment on WT, dcl2, l5, rpp9, dcl2/l5 and dcl2/rpp9 should genetically determine whether DCL2 activates innate immunity through L5 and RPP9 NLR receptors upon detection of dsRNA. (2) Perform infection experiments with phylogenetically distant RNA viruses, and test activation of immunity as in (1). Available and routinely used in Arabidopsis are, among others, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), Tobacco rattle virus (TRV), Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV), Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and Turnip crinkle virus (TCV – see above). These virus species have very different proteomes, replicate on different organelles, have different capsid shapes, etc. If several of these activate immunity in a DCL2/NLR-dependent fashion, the case for DCL2 being a sensor for dsRNA in vivo would be far more robust. Using these viruses to infect Col, dcl4, l5, rpp9, dcl4/l5, dcl4/rpp9, then assessing viral accumulation, would indicate that in addition to activating immunity, this mechanism also has antiviral activity. If these points are not addressed, I believe that claims of immune activation by viruses and antiviral activity should not be present as major conclusions in the paper. They could be suggested in the discussion. In addition, conclusions regarding dsRNA as the trigger for immunity should be tempered. It is my hope that these experiments will be conducted, and if the current conclusions of the authors are substantiated, this is a very significant discovery and advancement in plant virology and immunity. Next are listed some minor points to address. -	The authors refer to antiviral RNAi function of DCL2 as being dependent on the genetic abrogation of DCL4. The authors state more than once that DCL4 is the main antiviral Dicer, with DCL2 dicing only when DCL4 is somehow overwhelmed by viral dsRNA. This view is not up to date, as more recent studies have shown that in WT plants DCL2 can be an active antiviral RNAi player, depending on virus species and/or tissue (e.g.: doi: 10.1038/nplants.2017.94; doi: 10.1093/nar/gkab802), suggesting that precise function and context of DCL2 in antiviral RNAi remain poorly understood. This should at least be mentioned. -	A whole section in the middle of the manuscript delineates the model proposed by the authors, while describing some of the results. In my opinion this interrupts the flow of the manuscript. The results should be presented as in the rest of the manuscript, while the model should be built in the discussion or at the end of the results. A partial model is also presented in Figure 2, taking away space for data. -	The authors end the final paragraph of the results with “when RNAi has been abrogated by mutation of DCL4”. KO of DCL4 does not abrogate antiviral RNAi, it reduces its efficacy. This should be corrected.",2023-01-31T18:53:04,,Marco Incarbone,10.1101/2023.01.10.523395,Sensing of viral RNA in plants via a DICER-LIKE Ribonuclease,"Carsten Poul Skou Nielsen, Lijuan Han, Laura Arribas-Hernández, Darya Karelina, Morten Petersen, Peter Brodersen",2023-01-11

However, I should point out that the study is apparently lacking information from the most up to date records on the matter. In particular, the present work is not considering relevant outcomes by Virgili et al. (2022) on the same species treated here. For instance, the records and molecular data of Botrylloides niger, Symplegma brakenhielmi, and Polyclinum constellatum. Regarding P. constellatum, in fact neither Aydin-Önen et al. (2018) nor Montesanto et al. (2022) addressed this species as a cryptogenic. This species has undoubtedly recently arrived in the Mediterranean, although Virgili et al. (2022) has backdated its arrival and spread since 2014. Being the Mediterranean one of the most studied basin both regarding ascidians taxonomy and introduced species, it is odd that such an invasive species could have originated here and being totally overlooked in the past. Although I agree that relationships with congeneric species in the native areas are unclear and should be revised in the future.

Comparison with other treatments: Comparing the efficacy of mifepristone to other treatments could provide a more comprehensive understanding of its potential as a treatment option. In vivo validation: Although the 3D organotypic model provides a closer representation of the in vivo environment, validating the findings in animal models or clinical trials would further increase the reliability of the results. Long-term effects: Studying the long-term effects of mifepristone on cancer cells and its potential for preventing recurrence would be valuable for its clinical implications. Mechanism of action: Further investigation into the mechanism of action of mifepristone on cancer cells could provide a deeper understanding of how it inhibits their metastatic abilities.

As an undergraduate student reading for a journal club course, I found the pre-print well-written with clear language and thorough explanations of background information, making it an excellent introduction to cancer biology and neuroscience research methods for someone with minimal experience in the field, like myself. However, in my opinion, there are several areas in which this publication could be made more easily digestible. In figures 3 and 4, I found some in vivo data presentation choices to be unnecessarily confusing. For instance, in figures 3b and 4b, the coronal slices are in disarray, with large portions of the mouse brain missing, and the use of gray-scale nuclear stain makes it difficult to distinguish hGBM xenografts from the surrounding neural architecture; in the shFGFR1 slice of figure 3b, the xenograft appears indistinguishable from the adjacent lateral ventricle. Moreover, the identical shCo slices presented in both figures 3b and 4b lead the reader to believe that both experimental conditions, shFGFR1 and shFGFR2, were compared against the same shCo group, in which case, the data for all 3 conditions should have been statistically analyzed together and presented in the same figure for clarity. More generally, the use of plunger plots throughout this paper conceals the spread of the data set. An alternative statistical approach, such as box/whisker or violin plots, would have demonstrated the variance in the data. For example, in figure 2b, the mean fluorescence intensity of the tumor core appears to have a more skewed distribution than the invasive edge. Perhaps, this wide range of values reflects the heterogeneity of FGFR1 expression within the tumor core such that there are discrete populations of cells in the core with higher or lower FGFR1 expression. Perhaps, in future experiments, single-cell RNA sequencing with 10X Genomics could be used to identify populations with variable FGFR1 expression within the hGBM xenograft.",2023-01-30T03:30:59,,Nicole Agranonik,10.1101/2023.01.10.523434,Spatial distribution and functional relevance of FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression for glioblastoma tumor invasion,"Nawal Alshahrany, Ana Jimenez-Pascual, Florian A Siebzehnrubl",2023-01-10

We appreciate the time you took not only to read our work, but also to write this valuable review. A lot of your points were also noted by the reviewers and coauthors of this paper and have been corrected for the final version. We appreciate all your input for our future studies too. You raised very good questions and critique in regards to the role of ROS and the lack of data to back that up in our paper. To our knowledge, there was already enough data published discussing ROS expression after tobacco smoking, in vivo and in vitro. We didn't want to be redundant on that topic, but I agree with you in that we didn't further search for the role of EVs and ROS together, and that is definetly something that we could explore in the future. During the reviewing process, our cohort's demographics also came up and we analysed our data to see if BMI and/or sex switched our results and found no significant or relevant findings in this regard. In our recruitment process, we made sure to only include healthy individuals who didn't have any diagnosed disorders of any kind, so that variable is as controlled as we possibly could.

A lot of your comments and suggestions were also noted by the reviewers and were already worked on during the revision process. There were plenty of errors both in the way we displayed the data and in our descriptions too, and we hope that all of them are now fixed in the final version. One of these errors was definitely the description of the statistical tests used. As you correctly noticed, throughout the paper we incorrectly use ""non-parametric t-test"" when we aimed to state that non-parametric U-test for independent samples was used. When we compared dependent samples, we performed Wilconxon matched-pairs rank tests as you also rightfully suggested. In regard to the references, I think this was a problem with the citation software we used. Here I'll link the ones that are on that sentence you mentioned, but if you have any troubles finding any other let me know and I'll gladly provide them. I'll also make sure to revise the citation software used for this purpose, and confirm it's working properly to avoid these issues in the future. Zalba et al., 2007: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih...

Apologies if I have misread or misinterpreted the following.

Would a more fair comparitor to use for the single gene fitness score not be 2 gene-targetting guides + 2 non-essential guides?
