https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.10.480018v1#comment-5887895716,biorxivstage,0,"In this paper, the authors analyze an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of the yeast general recognition factor Abf1 with the aim of identifying functional determinants of Abf1’s IDR. The advantage of the authors’ plasmid shuffle experiments is that it allows the study of many mutations and variations of Abf1. The authors reveal that Abf1 possesses an essential motif (EM) as well as several contextual residues that work together to mediate Abf1’s function. Upon further investigation of compositionally and functionally similar IDR’s, the authors hypothesize that sequence specificity and chemical context in IDRs functionally overlap with each other rather than act independently, and propose a 2D model to describe the contributions of each in IDRs. The major success of this paper is in developing a model that reconciles two contributors to IDR function: sequence specificity and chemical context. The major weakness of the paper is that the model is not comprehensively backed with control experiments. The 2D landscape model presented argues that modulation of essential motifs and contextual amino acids can produce several binding modes; however, no data is presented to show that these chimeras are viable because they interact with the same factors or function in the same way that IDR2 does. Therefore, we can’t be certain if these are off-target effects or the same interactions that occur with IDR2 as put forward in the model.  In addition, we found some aspects of the organization of the paper may require more clarity. Overall, the paper reveals some of the functional determinants for Abf1’s IDR and proposes an intriguing model for the functional determinants of other IDRs, but it could be difficult for these findings to be generalized. Major points p.4: It is unclear to us why the minimal viable construct IDR2 449-662 is the background reference construct. Is it possible that IDR1 (absent in this construct) could provide unknown benefits in particular situations? For example, given the unknowns of Abf1’s interactome, is it possible that IDR1 helps to activate transcription of other genes that could rescue IDR2 mutants? Perhaps the presence of IDR1 could confer viability for IDR2 mutants that were deemed not viable in later experiments. Plasmid shuffle assays with IDR2 mutants that also have IDR1 present could be control experiments that answer this question. p.4 The constructs generated in this paper are tested for viability via plasmid shuffle assay, but there is no control experiment to ensure that these constructs are still interacting with the same partners or functioning in the same way that wildtype IDR2 does. One possible control experiment to test this could be to choose an Abf1-interacting partner based on proteomic literature on Abf1, and perform a co-immunoprecipitation/Western blot to see if the partner is still present across different IDR2 mutants. This control experiment should be done with full length Abf1, the background reference construct (with no IDR1), as well as a construct without the EM and a shuffled construct to represent the two extremes of the 2D landscape. p.5: The decision to choose the G4 motif does not have a strong justification or explanation. In figure 3F it is shown from the alignment between Abf1 and Gal4 that the region considered to have sub-homology does not overlap with the essential motif of Abf1 nor does it show similarity in its sequence. Therefore, in our view, it does not appear that Gal4 has an EM that is homologous to the EM of Abf1. Figure S1 PDF: By eye, it appears that there is large variation between the strains considered inviable – for example, FUS_1_163_WT clone 3 on page 6 and Shuffle 3 clones 2 and 3 on page 3 are both marked as inviable yet differ in growth. It could be helpful to readers if an explanation about why a binary classification of viable vs inviable was used in this study, as opposed to a sliding scale quantification. Minor points For a future direction, after identifying the essential motif in IDR2 (EM), we think it would be compelling to go back to the orthologs initially tested to see how conserved the essential motif is evolutionarily and to see how divergent the orthologs that we’re inviable were. We also feel that this could be incorporated into the paper’s discussion. Figure 3: Panels G-K were difficult for us to understand due to the sheer number of constructs presented. To us, the contrast between sequence-specific motif and chemical context would be clearer if panels E and K were combined, perhaps with labels “sequence specificity” and “chemical context” below the respective constructs, to underscore the two ends of the spectrum that these panels represent and to emphasize the unexpected viability of the constructs in K. p.2-3: The hypothesis that poorly conserved IDRs may still retain functional conservation is compelling, but the proteome-wide analysis of disorder leading up to this hypothesis could be clarified in the methods section. In particular, it would be helpful to include an explanation of why and how disorder score from metapredict and predicted pLDDT were used in conjunction with each other, as opposed to using the predicted consensus disorder score from metapredict alone.

However, the authors mention that genetically encoded biosensors (for e.g. cAMP sensors) are rarely used in high-throughput screenings. Probably they have overlooked a recent paper - [(Harkes and Kukk et al., 2021 - Dynamic FRET-FLIM based screening of signal transduction pathways) https://www.nature.com/arti... ]  in which they use an Epac based cAMP FRET sensor with FLIM as the readout and perform high-throughput arrayed siRNA based screen to study the breakdown kinetics of cAMP by the PDEs. Using FLIM as the readout of FRET sensors also circumvents some of the sensor expression level issues that are highlighted in this pre-print. Probably these are some points that the authors would like to take into account when revising their pre-print.",2022-06-13T08:30:22,,Sravasti Mukherjee,10.1101/2022.06.01.494354,Suitable use of FRET-based Biosensors for Quantitative Detection of GPCR Activation,"Nikolaj K.

My first comment is that Waddington was not the first one to propose the existence of distinct cell types, harbouring different functions. My second comment is more of a question: when you are using differentially expressed genes why do you still find no cluster structure? This seems weird to me. By definition of DE genes, they should define clusters.

In this response to the correspondence by Hejblum et al. [1], we clarify the reasons why we ran the Wilcoxon rank-sum test on the semi-synthetic RNA-seq samples without normalization, and why we could only run dearseq with its built-in normalization, in our published study [2]. We also argue that no normalization should be performed on the semi-synthetic samples. Hence, for fairer method comparison and using the updated dearseq package by Hejblum et al., we re-run the six differential expression methods (DESeq2, edgeR, limma-voom, dearseq, NOISeq, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) without normalizing the semi-synthetic samples, i.e., under the ""No normalization"" scheme in [1]. Our updated results show that the Wilcoxon rank-sum test is still the best method in terms of false discovery rate (FDR) control and power performance under all settings investigated. References 1.

I have a question for the authors, though. It seems that the theoretical findings on section II of the manuscript might rely on the assumption that the phase relationship between the harmonics (the phi_n) can be considered as phi_n=0 (meaning that all initial phases have the same value). This assumption is implicitly made in the case N=3, and explicitly stated in the case N=infinity, but it seems that it is not clearly justified throughout the text. Thus, it could still be the case that some of the theoretical findings would only be applicable to signals with phi_n=0. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify this issue.

We only saw your message today, but happy to discuss right away! 1. You are right that we did not specify the cervical or thoracic level of the human spinal cord samples in Table S7. The information there is the information that we received from the Netherlands Brain Bank, but I agree that it will be important to include the cervical or thoracic level of each sample. We do have low magnification images that we could also include in the revised version of the paper. I can share them with you before that and it will be great to hear a second, expert option on what cervical or thoracic level they belong to. 2. Thanks for bringing up those intriguing Cnr1-expressing ependymal cells in the rat spinal cord. I had a look in our integrated dataset (10x and Smart-seq2 datasets from 3-month-old mice) and found 19 cells expressing Cnr1 (0.68% of the cells). Most of them localise to the immature lateral cell clusters (activated or not). This is strikingly similar to the numbers that you found in the rat by immunofluorescence. Also in line with your findings, the percentage of Cnr1-expressing cells does not seem to change much with age (0.63% of ependymal cells express Cnr1 in the 10x dataset from aged mice). It is difficult to tell you more about Cnr1-expressing cells because of how very rare they are. I am planning to integrate our dataset with other datasets including spinal cord ependymal cell transcriptomes as they become publicly available to increase cell numbers and get even further with the downstream analysis (e.g clustering, differential expression analysis). I will keep Cnr1-expressing cells in mind, and keep in touch! :) Thanks again for taking the time to comment on our preprint. I look forward to continuing the discussion!

Indeed, because of the century long misleading view about the nature of viruses, in which viruses have been conceptually misidentified with the virus particles and erroneously defined based on their physical, biochemical and biological properties of these particles, the hypotheses about the evolutionary origin of viruses focus on the viral particles. As eloquently described by Salvador Luria and James Darnell in their seminal book General Virology, this conceptual constraint affects in particular the reductive hypothesis: "" The strongest argument against the regressive origin of viruses from cellular parasites is the non-cellular organization of viruses. The viral capsids are morphogenetically analogous to cellular organelles made up of protein subunits, such as bacterial flagella, actin filaments, and the like, and not to cellular membranes…. This theory today has little to recommend it, at least in its original form"" (from Ref. 12 in the Comment above). The Fusion Hypothesis circumvents this conceptual constraint and radically changes our view about the origin of viruses as well as their evolutionary trajectories and impact on the evolution of cellular lineages. If the ancestors of Borgs were indeed symbiotic/parasitic archaeal lineages that fused with their archaeal hosts and evolved as viral lineages, then, their genes, currently assumed to have been assimilated from their host cells, derived from the genes of their archaeal ancestors. In that case, the “Borgs” might be in need for a name adjustment; after all, they are just viruses living in their special environment, an archaeal host cell, which in long term can sustain their reductive evolution and diversification.",2022-05-31T15:01:32,disqus_k5QlD896Ld,Claudiu Bandea,10.1101/2021.07.10.451761,Borgs are giant extrachromosomal elements with the potential to augment methane oxidation,"Basem Al-Shayeb, Marie C.

Previous work from these authors established that NGF is important for the reinnervation of injured bone tissue. Here, they explore a secondary effect of NGF on mesenchymal cell migration that appears to be mediated by NGF’s low-affinity receptor p75. Using a variety of genetic techniques, the authors demonstrate that NGF promotes stromal cell migration in vitro, and that knockout of p75 in vivo slows bone repair. Further, p75 appears to control the expression of genes associated with cell migration. Thus, in addition to its role in bone reinnervation, NGF may act via p75 to promote stromal cell migration during bone repair. Major successes: The major success of the paper is a clear and well established connection between p75-NGF signaling and an effect on mesenchymal cell migration in mice. Also established is the importance of p75 for other processes, such as NGF production in macrophages and ossification of stromal cells. Major Weaknesses: The authors do not establish whether the effects of p75 knockout are independent of other NGF signaling pathways, such as the Trk family of NGF receptors. Thus, it is difficult to determine the relative importance of p75 versus Trk signaling in many of their experiments. Impact : This paper is the first to describe the dependence of calvarial bone repair on p75 signaling. This finding could have important clinical implications for treating bone injuries. Major Points: -A description of review committees overseeing the use of human samples for the research presented in this paper should be included. -Much of the paper relies on understanding the genetic tools, particularly transgenic mouse lines. There is no explanation in the text of what many of these transgenic lines are or what the abbreviations/notation used for them mean (e.g. NgfLysM). Interpretation of the results would be made easier if the authors included one-sentence descriptions of each of these tools and the logic behind using them. The genetics should also be added to the figures when they are critical to the experiment (e.g. a diagram of how the Cre-ER system works in figure 2). -In other contexts, p75 plays a modulatory role in neurotrophin signaling through its influence on other receptor pathways (e.g. Trks). The authors did not test here whether the effects of p75 knockout were via independent functional consequences of the p75 pathway, or relied on modulatory influences over other neurotrophin receptor pathways. For example, the results shown in figure 1 could be largely the result of TrkA signaling, with only partial dependence on p75. The additional finding that p75 knockout reduces overall NGF expression by macrophages (Fig 5) also further complicates the interpretation of many of the in vivo results. To address these complications, the authors could test whether p75 deletion from stromal cells influences the function of other neurotrophin receptors. This can be accomplished by using Trk inhibitors in conjunction with the p75 knockout/knockdown (these authors have demonstrated the ability to use such tools in their previous paper). This is an important experiment because it would determine whether the influence of NGF on p75 can be studied independently of its role in promoting reinnervation via Trk signaling, or if the two phenomena are better examined in relation to each other. -The authors’ should acknowledge additional caveats of their data from human cells/tissue. An important role for p75 in human cell migration is demonstrated in vitro, but it is not fully established in vivo. The observation that p75 is expressed during human bone injury does not alone indicate its function in vivo. Further, the human samples used were taken from tibia and ribs, whereas the rest of the paper is focused on calvarial bone repair. The authors should address these caveats and adjust the sentence beginning on line 261 to better reflect the full range of possibilities. -The paper emphasizes a role for p75 in cell migration. However, it is also clear that p75 likely influences a range of cellular functions beyond cell migration as well. For example,   RNA-seq experiments revealed a wide range of genes whose expression changed following p75 knockouts. Functions relating to NGF translation in macrophages were also likely impaired. These findings suggest that p75 may be critical to a broad range of cellular processes during injury repair, rather than just migration. Devoting more text to the discussion of p75’s role beyond just coordinating cell migration may broaden interest in this paper beyond its current scope. -The authors should include further details about calvarial defect procedures. Specifically, the authors should elaborate on why they choose this injury model over other available models that could recreate common fractures that skulls experience (e.g. of possible reasons: convenience for observations or less pain for animals). At a minimum, the authors should state a reason why they choose this injury model for their studies. This discussion could best fit in the Materials and Methods. Minor Points: -The number of observations appears to be underpowered for some experiments. Particularly, the results in Figs. 2K and 4C look to be trending towards significance, but include small sample sizes. A power analysis for these data, or increasing the number of observations per sample for these experiments, would strengthen the authors’ interpretations of the data. -The authors state the macrophage populations show a minor shift in population distribution based on the single cell data, but their IF shows significant differences in the number of macrophages at the injury site in the p75fl/fl and p75PDGFRa mice. An explanation for this discrepancy should be included. -The data in figure 5 demonstrate that p75 knockout depletes NGF expression in macrophages. This suggests a positive feedback loop between NGF expression and NGF signaling. The authors should explore the consequences of this finding in their discussion as it may be important for considering the interaction between p75 and Trk signaling during bone repair in vivo. -The authors should consider testing tissue samples for the presence of osteoclasts, due to the hypothesis that these cells could modulate the activity of osteoblasts. Generating this data would reinforce Figure 2 and the argument that p75 deletion is driving the lack of bone repair.Alternatively, the authors could discuss how osteoclasts modulate the osteoblast activity they describe through the presented data. This topic could be addressed in the Discussion section, for example as either a study limitations or future projections of this project. -The authors  should consider generating new images for Figure 2 panel I, and see if they can observe osteoblasts in the fracture healing area, using a higher magnification. This could reinforce the comparison among the two conditions presented by demonstrating the presence and hence participation of osteoblasts in the fracture healing process. Stylistic Points: -The order of the figures is a bit confusing. The authors switch back and forth between in vitro and in vivo experiments. One possible order is: Fig 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6. -Typo on line 77: “microdissection bone defect site”. -Reorganize Figures 1 H and I as Figures 1 B and C; they validate the model, and it may help readers accept the model before reporting any further data. -Each chart should have its own legend. Although the color coding is clear, this will help each graph to stand independently from each other and help readers interpret the data quickly. -Remove “squares” from the test in the Materials and Method section, or substitute with any possible missing symbol.

The paper as written includes three sets of data:  1) A four-gene phylogeny with broad taxon sampling, 2) phylogenetic analysis of transcriptomes of a smaller number of taxa, and 3) a plastome phylogeny.  The four-gene phylogeny is robust and shows clearly that one subgenome of Zea-Tripsacum is closely related to Urelytrum and Vossia.

The n for these statistical tests should be the number of samples, not the number of tracks or cells in each sample. In other words, the number of degrees of freedom should not be more than the number of times you applied the osmotic shock, because you're trying to help the reader infer that if one were to apply the osmotic shock an additional time, one would likely see a similar drop in the diffusivity. So inferential statistics need to be calculated with n=samples not n=cells. See: https://rupress.org/jcb/art...

Doing a dimensionality reduction step on the response matrix Y before performing alignment is a great idea. We haven't tried that yet, but I suspect that alignment would work well in this case (as long as you use enough PCs). The only downside is that the second-layer GP would no longer represent a function capturing the original phenotype (e.g. gene expression) but rather a low-dimensional representation of the phenotype. So in order to model the phenotype with the aligned coordinates you would have to plug the original Y matrix back into a model with the aligned coordinates (but this wouldn't be too hard).

(2022): model mis-specification criticism overlooks sensitivity analyses and orthogonal analyses The core criticism of our study (Yap et al., 2021) made by Morton et al. was that the linear mixed model (LMM) framework we employed includes a questionable biological assumption – that diet and the microbiome are independent. They correctly note that diet is known to influence the microbiome (David et al., 2014; Rothschild et al., 2018), and thus, as these factors are inter-related, our model may be prone to biased inference. We acknowledge these points in relation to the specific LMM (see below) on which the critique by Morton et al. is focused. However, we respectfully disagree with their conclusion that this issue invalidates the findings reported in our paper, because their critique (1) incorrectly asserts that this result formed the basis of our conclusions, and (2) it overlooks several key analyses, including extensive sensitivity analyses that were specifically performed to test this (and other) assumptions. Morton and colleagues focus on a single LMM analysis of ASD in their critique, in which we adjusted for sex, age and diet, the latter by fitting the top three principal components from PCA of the centre log ratio (clr)-transformed percent energy variables from the Australian Eating Survey (AES), a validated food frequency questionnaire. In this analysis, we found that 0% of the variance in ASD diagnosis was associated with the microbiome, irrespective of the microbiome features used to construct the correlation matrix describing the relationships between random effects (e.g., common species, rare species, common genes, rare genes) (Yap et al., 2021). As diet is correlated with the microbiome, it is possible that adjusting for diet in this analysis has removed variance in ASD diagnosis that may be attributable to the microbiome. In their critique, the authors present simulations purporting to show that this issue could lead to failure to detect even very large proportions of variance (in their example 83%) (Morton, Donovan, & Taroncher-Oldenburg, 2022). Unfortunately, they fail to mention that we also performed a LMM analysis of ASD in which we did not adjust for diet (or sex or age). If there was an effect of the microbiome on ASD that had previously been removed by adjusting for diet, then this should now be “revealed” (i.e., captured by the microbiome random effect). However, we found precisely the same result as in our original analysis: that is, 0% of the variance in ASD diagnosis is associated with the microbiome (Yap et al., 2021). Based upon this analysis of the available data we believe it is unlikely that our conclusions have been biased by model mis-specification. The authors also do not acknowledge that we performed LMM analyses of traits other than ASD, and whereas there was negligible signal for ASD, IQ and sleep problems, we found large and significant associations of the microbiome with age, sex and stool consistency. Our results for age (i.e., ~30% of the variance associated with common microbiome species) are particularly notable because they recapitulate the findings reported in a large (independent) sample of >30K adult stool metagenomes (Rothschild et al., 2020). Our LMM results for age, sex and stool consistency were also largely unaffected by adjusting for diet (Yap et al., 2021). These analyses, which were specifically included for the purpose of benchmarking the findings for ASD, provide further evidence that our methods are not prone to under-estimating the proportion of trait variance associated with the microbiome. It is also relevant to highlight that the directionality of the causal graphs presented by Morton et al. in Figure 1 of their article (i.e., a causal effect of both the microbiome and diet on the host phenotype) are problematic, since the variance component estimates from these models might reflect cause or consequence of the focal trait. This is because microbiome taxonomic proportions change, unlike genotypes used in analogous LMM methods for estimating heritability (which are present at birth and therefore representative of causality). To demonstrate this, take as an example our analysis in which age was the dependent variable and microbiome measures were fitted as random effects (allowing capture of their interdependence). We find roughly 30% of the variance in age is associated with common microbiome species. Clearly, the way to interpret this result is that age is causal for the variance in the microbiome, not the other way round. It is equally possible that ASD influences diet and in turn the microbiome, as opposed to the opposite view espoused by Morton et al. Indeed, the wording used in their critique (i.e., “A more accurate model would have assumed an architecture that explicitly incorporates the direct influence of diet on the ASD phenotype as well as an indirect influence of diet on the ASD phenotype via the microbiome”) appears not to recognise this possibility. Looking beyond the LMM analyses in our paper, Morton and colleagues also did not consider several other key sets of analyses on which are conclusions are based, including differential abundance testing using ANCOM (Analysis of Composition of Microbiomes) and extensive linear model analyses. In our ANCOM analysis of ASD, we find a single robustly associated species ( Romboutsia timonensis) when adjusting for sex, age and dietary PCs, but this same species remains the only significant finding in analyses without covariates (Yap et al., 2021). This is entirely consistent with our LMM model findings but is not what would be expected if the microbiome was associated with a high proportion of variance in ASD diagnosis. Indeed, irrespective of how the data are analysed (e.g., sibling pairs only, excluding siblings, excluding children with recent exposure to antibiotics, and others), we find negligible evidence for association of individual species with ASD (other than R. timonensis), and no support whatsoever for taxa previously reported to be associated with ASD. In our linear model analyses, we show that quantitative measures of the autism spectrum, including both psychometric measures (e.g., ADOS-2/G Restricted and Repetitive Behaviour (RRB) calibrated severity scores) and polygenic scores were associated with reduced dietary diversity (Yap et al., 2021). The most parsimonious interpretation of these findings is that RRBs, which are one of the core diagnostic signs of ASD, manifest in the form of more selective dietary preferences. Polygenic scores, as an immutable component of propensity to ASD-associated traits, are an important and novel aspect of our analysis, given they facilitate preliminary causal inference (noting that we were careful to avoid strong statements about causality in our paper). In contrast, other cross-sectional autism microbiome studies – whose results have been prioritised by Morton et al. – have not exploited genetic predictors for autism-related traits and so cannot distinguish between cause and consequence. Overall, using a variety of orthogonal analytical approaches, we find a strong and consistent signal that ASD (and autistic traits) is associated with reduced dietary diversity, and that diet in turn is associated with the microbiome (Yap et al., 2021). These results are consistent with existing evidence for dietary effects on the microbiome (David et al., 2014; Rothschild et al., 2018) – as pointed out by Morton et al. – and with prior evidence (backed by clinical and lived experience) for an association of autism with diet (Berding & Donovan, 2018). We find no direct association of ASD with the microbiome, a result to which Morton and colleagues express surprise, their argument being that if ASD is associated with diet and diet influences the microbiome, then how can there be no direct ASD-microbiome association? The answer is simply that we have a finite sample, and the effect sizes are subtle. We expect that in a larger sample we might observe a direct association, but also stronger evidence that this is due to changes in diet that are related to autistic traits. This is a considerably more intuitive and parsimonious explanation for associations of the microbiome with ASD than the idea that the microbiome contributes to autistic traits, not least because there is strong evidence that ASD is a neuro-developmental condition, and expression of established ASD genes is enriched prenatally (Satterstrom et al., 2020). In this context, it is worth emphasising that the high estimated heritability of ASD (70-80%) (Bai et al., 2019) leaves relatively little room for other putative etiological causal factors (e.g., maternal immune activation). This is especially true given de novo mutations that are known to be important in ASD (Sanders et al., 2015; Sanders et al., 2012; Satterstrom et al., 2020) largely do not contribute to heritability estimates (i.e., because they are not shared by relatives) and so must consume an additional proportion of the remaining 20-30% of variance. Morton et al.’s criticism of our study comes despite it being the largest (and therefore most statistically well-powered) to date. Our study also has the dual benefits of matching data on diet and other confounders, which are lacking in many prior studies, and deep metagenomic sequencing, compared to inferior 16S technology in most published ASD microbiome papers. We note that ours is not the first study to report negligible association of the microbiome with ASD (Gondalia et al., 2012; Son et al., 2015). We also point to a recent review in Cell on microbiome studies in animal models (including for autism) highlighting the implausibility of the high proportion of positive findings, asserting that the field suffers from publication bias (Walter, Armet, Finlay, & Shanahan, 2020). That said, we acknowledge that our study has limitations, reflecting difficulties of collecting idealised data sets. Prospective studies collecting faecal samples from infants prior to autism diagnosis are needed to further advance the field, but these are challenging both logistically and because sample size is limited by the population prevalence of ASD (~1%). To sum up, we thank Morton et al. for their comments in relation to one specific analysis in our paper. This provides us with the opportunity to clarify the detailed analyses that we performed to reach our conclusions. Unfortunately, the critique from Morton et al. (based solely on simulations) overlooks most of our results, including sensitivity analyses that directly address their criticism. The authors suggest that our data should be re-analysed. We note that our data are available by application to the Australian Autism Biobank which allows other researchers to provide objective empirical evaluation. We are committed to transparent research and provide extensive supplementary materials and publicly available code and hope others in the research community will build upon our work. Chloe X.

Takahashi, +6 authors H. Okamoto, Published 20 December 2000, BiologyBiochemical and biophysical research communications TT virus (TTV) has not yet been cultured or visualized. We attempted to recover and visualize TTV-associated particles from the serum samples and feces of infected humans. Serum samples were obtained from 7 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Three patients had a high TTV DNA titer (10(8) copies/ml), three had a low TTV DNA titer (10(2) copies/ml), and one was negative for TTV DNA. Fecal supernatant was obtained from a different TTV-infected subject. The serum samples were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and TTV DNA-rich fractions were subjected to floatation ultracentrifugation in cesium chloride. Virus-like particles, 30-32 nm in diameter, were found in the 1.31-1.33 g/cm(3) fractions from each of the three serum samples with high TTV DNA titer, but not in any fraction from the four serum samples that either were negative for TTV DNA or had low TTV DNA titer. The TTV particles formed aggregates of various sizes, and immunogold electron microscopy showed that they were bound to human immunoglobulin G. Similar virus-like particles with a diameter of 30-32 nm banding at 1.34-1.35 g/cm(3) were visualized in fecal supernatant with TTV genotype 1a by immune electron microscopy using human plasma containing TTV genotype 1a-specific antibody.",2022-05-19T12:09:27,karelmorawetz,Karel Morawetz,10.1101/2022.04.28.489885,Human anelloviruses produced by recombinant expression of synthetic genomes,"Dhananjay M.

Only about a third or less of this region is actually a steppe (the Pontic-Caspian steppe). Calling this region Eastern Europe would be more useful and in tune with geographic conventions. - what you call Eastern Europe is not generally, by itself, known as Eastern Europe, especially since the fall of the Iron Curtain. That is, Czechia, Hungary and Slovakia (often along with Poland) are nowadays more commonly described as East Central Europe. - what you call SE Central Europe is actually much of the Balkans, and thus straight up Southeastern Europe.

I enjoyed the flexible modeling framework in the two-step GP, enabling multiple responses (potentially modeled with low-rank structures). For the multi-output GP, one naive approach might be running PCA/SVD on the output matrix Y (on one of the original coordinates, perhaps with the most number of spots) to capture the most variation. I wonder if you had tried something simple like this before establishing your approach (k-NN-based response filtering combined with linear modeling with LMC) and have some insights around this topic.

Below I'm pasting our reply sent to Dr. Hejblum et al on the same day. We believe that our discussion will be beneficial for the community. ###### Dear Dr. Hejblum and all, Thank you for sending us your correspondence draft. We appreciate your professionalism. The main message of our article is that using popular methods without a sanity check may lead to inflated FDR, and permutation offers an easy sanity check. We agree that normalization is a tricky issue, and when samples do not need normalization (as is the case for permuted samples, which all come from the same ""condition""), normalization may introduce unwanted bias, violate the null hypothesis, and thus deteriorate the FDR control. Meanwhile, we stand with our fundamental assumption that permuted samples should contain no true DE genes. Since many DE methods include normalization as an internal step and only accept count data as input, the only way to fairly compare them is to apply each method as a whole pipeline, not just its DE statistical test step, to the permuted samples. (That is, the ""normalization first"" approach in your manuscript is inapplicable to the DE methods that only accept count data, unless we dissect these methods and modify their code, which is beyond the scope of our benchmark study.) As a result, any bias introduced by normalizing the permuted samples (which do not need normalization) would be reflected in the actual FDR inflation. The Wilcoxon test is an exception because it is not a DE analysis pipeline, so we applied it to permuted samples without doing normalization in Figure 2A. This explains why our Figure 2A differs from your Figure 1A. We would like to clarify that our study is not a comprehensive benchmark because (1) there are numerous DE methods and (2) we did not want to dilute the cautionary message against using the popular DESeq2 and edgeR without a sanity check. Hence, we did not do a dissection of each method to find out how to fix the inflated FDR issue. Our dearseq results are based on dearseq (asymptotic), not dearseq (permuted), because we deemed dearseq (asymptotic) more appropriate when the sample size is large. We appreciate your clarification about the effect of normalization on the dearseq performance, and your results motivated us to think about the problem more clearly. However, we respectfully disagree with your conclusion that dearseq outperforms Wilcoxon in your results. Our reasoning is that only dearseq (asymptotic), not dearseq (permuted) has a slight power advantage over Wilcoxon, but dearseq (asymptotic) does not guarantee to control the FDR when the sample size is under 40; on the other hand, Wilcoxon only sacrifices power but not FDR control when the sample size is small. Nevertheless, we agree that dearseq is advantageous in that it can account for more complex experimental designs. We would be happy to publicly respond to your correspondence when needed. We believe that our discussion will be beneficial for the community.

The study showed that over a quarter of the dogs were mixed breed. So not pure or bred to impeccable standards. The full research document shows their age on average of 11.9 months. This study is also applied to companion dogs that were showed no signs of fear, anxiety, stress or aggression. Only a very small percentage of dogs in family homes as companions show those affects to any degree that it becomes a temperament issue. Again, we're talking about companion dogs with less than two months of training as evidenced by the criterion of the study. The study was not meant to measure methods for rehabilitation dogs or dogs on the far end of the FAS scale. To spin the research and data in a narrative of debunking one training method or another is frowned upon. None of these dogs were considered perfect or bred for temperament or any other trait for the purposes of this study. The dogs were selected only to have had minimal training to eliminate ""habituation to training methods"" and to have no signs of severe aggression, anxiety, stress, etc. Take the research as a scientific study for what it was without bias.",2022-05-14T01:16:32,canineforward,Canine Forward,10.1101/823427,Does training method matter?: Evidence for the negative impact of aversive-based methods on companion dog welfare,"Ana Catarina Vieira de Castro, Danielle Fuchs, Stefania Pastur, Liliana de Sousa, I Anna S Olsson",2019-10-29

Very valid concern - I did use the 10x prefiltered gtf file as a starting point as most users probably use that as the default option. So all improvements are made based on the latest 10x Genomics default human and mouse genome annotations/reference transcriptomes.

Depositing our code in a permanent repository is a great idea -- we will look into that further. Here are some other thoughts on your questions: - Would you be interested in trying out your method in our 2021 data with spatially-adjacent replicates? Yes absolutely! - How far can you go in µm? We have some replicates 300 µm apart It's hard to give an answer that's universally true across all tissue types, as it depends a lot on the ""frequency"" of spatial variation along that axis. That said, we would love to take a further look at the data you mentioned to see if it's 300 µm is doable. - Can you combine H&E + smFISH images? Yes in theory it shouldn't be a problem with our model, although we haven't tried it in practice. - For the future studies that you described, what contingencies are you considering for cases where an intermediate tissue slide has a technical problem like tissue folding? Great question. We're hoping to allow for more human-in-the-loop involvement so users can interfere if there's a known issue. In some cases, the model may be able to correct for large technical distortions, like folds, in a data-driven way, although it may also be useful to consider ways to automatically detect common types of technical issues.",2022-05-12T20:18:41,disqus_POAHSjWgm0,Andy Jones,10.1101/2022.01.10.475692,Alignment of spatial genomics and histology data using deep Gaussian processes,"Andrew Jones, F.
