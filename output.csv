http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/26/103424#comment-5593546328,biorxivstage,3,"To help readers understand the path to publication, I am adding an account of the peer review process to each preprint. This article was initially rejected without peer-review by PLOS Pathogens. We then submitted to Scientific Reports, where the paper was accepted following review: Reviewer comments: Reviewer #1 (Technical Comments to the Author): In this manuscript, Ho et al. reported a 7-Å resolution cryoEM reconstruction model of MrNV VLP expressed in insect cells. MrNV could cause white tail disease in the giant freshwater prawn with high mortality rate, therefore is a serious threat to aquaculture. Together with PvNV infecting marine shrimp, MrNV may represent a new genus in the Nodaviridae family. The structure presented here shows a different arrangement of protruding spikes on the icosahedral capsid surface, compared to other nodaviruses, supporting this classification. The most significant difference is that the protrusions are dimeric, instead of trimeric as in other nodaviruses. This manuscript is well written. The methodology from VLP expression, purification, to imaging and 3D reconstruction is standard and clearly explained. The conclusions are logical based on the results. Some discussions could be better elaborated: 1.The authors devoted a lot of space (especially figures) to the homology modeling which did not provide much information besides that the P domain of MrNV capsid protein is different from the input homologous models. It would be more helpful to instead show figures of the models fitted in the MrNV map, to directly show the discrepancies and suggest possible location of the MrNV P domain. 2.Given the current information, there is not sufficient evidence to say whether the fuzzy density beneath 5-fold symmetry axis is RNA. The authors could discuss the possibility of it being protein, such as the N-terminal region of capsid, which is usually disordered in other nodaviral structures. 3.Literature (ref. 14 &15) has shown two different assembly states of MrNV VLP expressed in E. coli and sf9 cells respectively. Could the structural information reported here help to explain the differences? 4.Structural characterization of MrNV is in need due to the threat from white tail disease. Now with the 7-Å resolution available, the authors could discuss more about followup studies and/or downstream applications leading to potential intervention against white tail disease. Some minor points: 1.Has the final map been deposited to the EMDataBank? 2.With the current figures, the comparison between AB and CC dimers is a little hard to follow. It would help to label the A, B, C subunits. It is fine to label the dimers with colored arrows, but it would be more clear if the coloring is consistent between Figures 2 and 3. Please also consider including the measurements of angles and lengths in the figures, and labeling the supporting legs of CC dimer with an arrow or asterisk. Reviewer #2 (Technical Comments to the Author): The authors present work showing a cryo-EM 3D reconstruction of MrNV virus-like particles with the finding that “pronounced dimeric blade-shaped spikes"" protruding above the surface of the particle are arranged differently than canonical structures of Alphanodaviruses. Thus the authors believe the new structure supports the prior assertion that MrNV belongs to a new genus of Nodaviridae designated Gammanadovirus. The authors use a generally accepted approach during the reconstruction process although the use of a crystal structure as an initial model rather than using an initial model generated from their experimental 2D class averages could possibly confound the interpretation. Whenever a known structure is used it can lead to potential model bias. It is this reviewer’s assumption that the authors used FHV for the initial model since FHV doesn’t have significant spikes on the surface. The authors also used a low-pass filter of 60 angstroms to the FHV initial model to partially mitigate model bias. In both of these cases this is typically an ok approach if significant homology exists. However the authors force icosahedral symmetry during reconstruction and they themselves highlight the fact that MrNV and FHV share only 20% homology. The manuscript could therefore be greatly strengthened by a reference-free 3D reconstruction where the initial model is created from the experimental 2D class averages rather than the FHV crystal structure. If the final reconstruction for the reference-free approach remains similar/identical to the current reconstruction, then the authors will have demonstrated conclusively that the interpretation is sound. Therefore it is suggested that the authors incorporate the results of a reference-free reconstruction into the manuscript (a supplemental figure will be fine). As this requires a rerun of only the 3D refinement image processing step and not new data acquisition, this should not be considered a major modification and if this is successfully implemented then this reviewer recommends publication. A few other minor comments to be addressed: According to Reference #9 (NaveenKumar et al. 2013) the capsid protein of MrNV and PvNV only share 44.6% homology but that drops to 22% for the last 115 amino acids at the C-terminus which is the region the author attribute to forming the protruding spikes. Thus, it seems possible that the structure of PvNV may be different. It is this reviewer’s suggestion that the authors refrain from extending their interpretation towards PvNV and simply focus on MrNV throughout the manuscript. Please define “VLPs” as “virus-like particles” in the abstract rather than just using the acronym. There appears to be a 6xHis-tag on the capsid protein but it is not used for purification scheme. A sentence should be added to describe why it is included and whether the additional amino acids are anticipated to be present within the dimeric spikes or otherwise impact the interpretation. During the post-processing steps, a b-factor of -890 square angstroms was applied. Was this calculated automatically using Relion or was it manually chosen? Figure 1, it would be helpful to see a sampling of the refined 2D class averages in addition to the central slice of the reconstruction. On line 120, suggest deleting “sharply resolved” to leave sentence as “Inspection of figure 1(b) reveals a capsid shell measuring between 2 and…” since “sharply resolved” is a qualitative term that others may feel is only appropriate for truly atomic resolution structures. Finally, the homology modelling is an interesting addition to the paper. However, since no conclusive results can really be drawn from the models at this time, it seems more appropriate for figure 4 to move to a supplemental figure.",2021-11-02T09:56:52,disqus_Ao3NahMvYd,David Bhella,,,,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/23/397901#comment-5593487738,biorxivstage,3,"To help readers understand the process of peer-review, I am adding the peer-reviewer comments and article submission history for all of my preprints. This article describes one of the most significant discoveries of my career and I started out sending a presubmission enquiry to Nature, where it was taken forward for review. Review round 1 Referee #1 (Remarks to the Author): This work by Conley et al. addresses a long-time enigma in the calicivirus field: elucidating the unknown function of the small basic protein, VP2, encoded near the 3’-end of every genome. This protein had no detectable sequence homology with other known viral or eukaryotic proteins and was highly variable in sequence and mass among members of the Caliciviridae genera. In a stunning piece of cryo-EM structural detective work enabled by knowledge of the feline calicivirus receptor (fJAM-A) and capsid architecture, the authors pursued the identity of an unexpected density that appeared only when the FCV capsid was bound with its cognate receptor ectodomain. This density was shown to be a dodecameric arrangement of VP2 to create a unique structure at one 3-fold symmetry axis of each virus particle. Evidence was presented that this structure was involved in the creation of a portal assembly at the unique 3-fold axis for release of the RNA genome from the virion into the cell (likely from within an endosomal compartment). The paper is well-written and the figures and movies are of excellent quality. This original work should create interesting new avenues of research, not only in the calicivirus field, but potentially for other viruses as well. 1. This discovery is exciting, and deserves further discussion in context of the published literature. Perhaps there is a stringent word limit, but, if possible, please elaborate briefly on a couple points. Direct VP1 and VP2 interactions had been reported in the literature (e.g., Kaiser et al., JGV, 2006 and Vongpunsawad et al., JVI, 2013), and the VP2 was proposed to play a role in viral assembly and stability. Are the interaction sites mapped in previous studies consistent with the new model and how might VP2 enhance stability of the particle? In addition, it is noteworthy that the virion-incorporated VP2 (now 12 copies) is more abundant in the particle than previous stoichiometric studies suggested (such as the approx. 1.5 copies per norovirus VLP of Glass et al., JVI 2000 or the 1-2 copies per FCV virion of Sosnovtsev and Green, Virology 2000). One early study of FCV could not detect the ORF3 product in virions at all (Tohya et al., JVM, 1999). Does the new model provide a possible explanation for this discrepancy? The putative metal binding site in the VP1 is new and of interest. Will this be explored further with crystallography and metal soaking experiments? Is mutagenesis of the putative potassium binding site lethal for F9? 3. The time of incubation at each of the conditions shown in Figures S13 and S15 would be helpful to include in the figure legend. Please use an arrow or two in Figure S15 to show a representative ball of density said to likely reflect the viral RNA. 4. Are the six tyrosine residues that line the capsid pore conserved in all FCV strains? Other caliciviruses? Can VP2 proteins among the other calicivirus genera be modeled to interact in a similar dodecameric arrangement? 5. The VPg is not mentioned in the model of viral entry. Was anything learned about the orientation of the viral genome as it exits the portal, and can it be predicted? There has been no reported evidence that VP2 binds RNA. How might interaction with the genome occur? 6. The first demonstration of VP2 as a minor calicivirus structural protein was shown with RHDV by Wirblich, Thiel and Meyers (JVI, 1996). Perhaps this work should be cited along with Glass et al. (reference 9). Referee #2 (Remarks to the Author): This is a potentially interesting paper that provides structural evidence for the existence of a 12-fold symmetric tube, similar to a portal protein, in caliciviruses. My fundamental problem with this work is that the identification of a tube that ‘looks’ like a portal protein is solely based on the structural similarity with the barrel domain of P22 portal protein (by the way this work is not even referenced!). There are no ‘hard’ data supporting the various speculative hypotheses that VP2 functions in DNA ejection(like a portal protein) and that VP2 hydrophobic N- termini insert into the endosomal membrane forming a channel (like protein H in phiX174). In essence, this paper is speculative, preliminary and stuffed with hypotheses that could be tested experimentally. At the current stage, this work is of medium impact and should find publication in a specialized journal like the Journal of Virology, Virology, etc. Specific comments - Figure 1. This figure could go to the Supplementary Information or, at least, be deemphasized. - Figure 2. Panel b and c are redundant and provide the same information. Instead this figure lacks a clear description of the putative portal protein. All I see is a 12-fold symmetric tube of density that looks like the barrel domain of P22 portal protein (e.g. again, the authors don’t even reference the various papers that describe P22 portal protein and its barrel domain). B - Figure 2a. The tube of density in panel b is after applying averaging. It's not clear if the authors used 3-fold or local 12-fold averaging. In either case, how does the unaverage density look like? - What percentage of particles shows the portal-like structure? - Figure 3C. What metal ion is shown in this panel? What is the evidence to assign a metal ion rather than a water molecule? Dedicating two panels to a ‘yet to be determined ‘ metal ion seems inappropriate - Figure 5 is overcrowded and somewhat incremental. Referee #3 (Remarks to the Author): Using asymmetric reconstruction techniques on cryo electron microscopy data, Colney et al show that one vertex of icosahedral feline calicivirus recognizes the cellular receptor, namely junctional adhesion molecule A. The vertex is formed by six copies of the VP2 minor capsid protein. Presumably the virus assembles with six VP2 molecules decorating each 3-fold vertex, but association with receptor at one vertex modifies the icosahedral structure of this vertex to create a portal and channel wide enough to allow the +RNA genome to escape into the potential host cell. The paper is mostly well written although the figures and figure captions need improvement and clarification. The frequent use of the word “reveal” (“show” would be better to avoid spiritual implications) and “interest” (the reader should judge for him/her self to determine what is interesting) should be avoided. The asymmetric cryoEM analysis was well executed. Reference to the earlier publication on calicivirus structure (Prasad et al Science, 286, 287-288, 1999) would have been helpful for an explanation of “AB” and “CC” dimers and a description of the protruding P domain. It is not clear whether VP2 is present at all 20 3-fold vertices in the assembled, mature virus or whether the virus assembles with VP2 present only at one unique vertex. In the former case the act of binding the receptor would create the unique portal vertex. In the latter case the uniqueness of one vertex would have been established during the assembly process. This needs to be clarified. However, the presence of a unique vertex in a calicivirus, no matter by what mechanism, suggests that similar situations might exist in many other apparently icosahedral viruses. Thus this opens the door to a vast new appreciation of “icosahedral” virus assembly processes and cell entry mechanisms. This is therefore an extremely important paper Round 2 Referees' comments: Referee #1 (Remarks to the Author): This is a revised version of a manuscript by Conley et al. that utilizes cryo-EM and structural modeling to define a proposed function for the minor calicivirus capsid protein, VP2. The authors have added helpful new references, modified or added figures, and clarified a number of points suggested by the referees. The authors have not provided additional experimentation that would directly support their proposed function of the VP2, citing an expected prolonged delay in the publication of this structure. Although compelling evidence for interaction of the VP2 portal with an endosomal membrane bilayer would indeed be a crowning achievement of this work, the new insight into the conformational changes in the structure of a calicivirus particle following binding to its cognate receptor remains an important advance. Please clarify the following: 1. In the response to Referee 2, the authors note the following: “This was addressed in the legend to supplemental figure S7 (now S8), 81.6% of particles showed one or more portals.” Were there indeed certain particles that appeared to contain more than one portal? How commonly were these observed? Please clarify what this observation implies because it is somewhat inconsistent with the model of a single exit point for the genome. 2. The citation of work that shows the importance of Leucine 7 in the FCV VP2 is appropriate, but this new text should be re-written and clarified. For example, without context that this is mutagenesis of the FCV genome by reverse genetics and virus recovery studies, the concept of “strongly selected for” and the meaning of the other amino acid substitutions is unclear.",2021-11-02T07:58:51,disqus_Ao3NahMvYd,David Bhella,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/28/290544#comment-5592585758,biorxivstage,3,"To help readers understand the process from preprint to published articles, I have decided to share details of peer review and reviewers comments for my articles. This paper was submitted to PLOS Biology, where after peer review it was eventually accepted. Reviewers comments: Reviewer 1 The portal vertex is the aperture located within many virus capsids that allows the nucleic acid to enter and exit. It is an essential feature but in herpesviruses has escaped high resolution observation because of its similarity with the 11 other pentonic vertices located in herpesvirus capsids.  This paper describes a structure of the portal vertex of herpes simplex at the highest resolution to date.  New features are revealed including a novel 5-fold symmetric bridge between the external surface of the capsid and the inner portal comprising copies of UL6, and a large structure on the surface that borders the portal vertex,  presumably helping to anchor it in place.  Density consistent with viral DNA is located within the pore located within the portal, which is similar to some tailed bacteriophages, confirming a longstanding hypotheses that the herpesvirus capsid and some phage capsids work in similar ways. The work is particularly timely given recent publications in Science magazine (Volume 360, April issue) that show  high resolution structures of the capsid; but those structures lack the portal shown here. This will be of interest to virologists in general and herpesvirologists in particular. The interest to scientists outside the field includes  the novel methods used with the Titan cryoelectron microscope to reconstuct  this asymmetrical feature at high resolution in the face of similar but functionally, and as it turns out, structurally distinct pentonic vertices.   The novel approach in which focusing on each facet was used to classify capsids into 10 groups,  one of which led to the appearance of a novel pentonic vertex in the reconstruction was clever and could be used more broadly for other asymmetric structures thath are less than obvious at first glance. Thus, structural biologists, nanotechnologists and materials scientists may also  find this paper intriguing. This paper is outstanding in the discipline and has presented data that answers a longstanding problem in the field, with appropriate posing of new questions. The authors have reached reasonable conclusions based on the data, with reasonable speculation of the identity of the protein comprising the 5-fold symmetric bridging structure based on what is currently known.  There will be great interest to identify what this protein is. The paper is well witten with only a few Typos: Line 140 does not read correctly. Lines 78, 155, 256. The word comprise is misused.  “The apartment comprises 4 rooms” is correct.  “An apartment is composed of 4 rooms” is also correct.   “The apartment is comprised of 4 rooms” is incorrect. Reviewer 2 Several major articles in recent years have revealed the high resolution structures of herpesviruses icosahedral capsids. However, information on the portal vertex that is essential for both viral genome encapsidation and decapsidation is still missing. In this article, McElwee et al. describe a subnanometer structure of the portal vertex and reveal several previously unknown structural features surrounding it. Such data should be useful for any researcher aiming at understanding the essential processes involving this vertex.  The resolution is still insufficient for assigning unambiguously some of these different features to HSV1 proteins limiting its mechanistic implications. Major points: - The PVAT unique structural organization in the icosahedral capsid is the novelty of this work. The five-fold symmetric features of the portal vertex are enhanced by C5 symmetry reconstruction. Clear densities of the purple and magenta regions of the vertex in Figure 2e,f support that they follow a five-fold symmetric organization. This is less obvious for the region exposed to the capsid outside where 2x5copies of the UL25 Cter structure were docked (film 2) which appears somehow blurred in cut-open structures (Figure 2a,c,e and film 3). The 12-fold symmetric portal protein UL6 is smeared-out, as expected, by the C5 symmetrisation. This raises a number of structural and biological questions that the authors shall address. How is the portal protein position maintained in the portal vertex (very few contacts are observed) to establish a continuous channel with the portal vertex pentameric protein for DNA passage in spite of their symmetry mismatch? How are the two UL25 Cter rings maintained in place and where do their Nter extensions fit in the portal vertex densities? The assignment as show in figure 2e (portal vertex in mauve, CATC in cyan) does not seem compatible with the observation by Pasdeloup et al. (2009; J Virol 83:6610) that UL6 and UL25 are directly interacting. How do the authors reconcile this discrepancy? - Figure 2 does not optimally illustrate the different novel features highlighted in the text. This information is present in the supplementary movies but it would be probably useful to have these points illustrated in the main figures. Probably the most important would be to show a comparison between the portal vertex and the other vertices, this would show the extension of the specificities of the portal vertex. A closer view of the newly described pentameric portal vertex protein would also be useful.  This could even grow into an additional figure to better document differences between the portal and other penton vertices.  Across these lines Figure 3, which deals with DNA packing inside the capsid, might be of less interest and eventually used as a Supplementary figure. - Line 355 and throughout the manuscript, including figure legends and movies: the authors use the expression ""a sharpened map"" to designate high threshold rendering of the reconstructions and use different thresholds in the figures. They shall define what they mean by ‘sharpened map” and specify the threshold used in each figure panel, as this varies, and probably also in the movie parts. Minor points : 1- Line 56 : ""dense proteinaceous layer"". ""dense"" is unclear and should either be removed or precised. 2- Line 66: ""preformed procapsids"" is more correct than ""nascent capsids"" 3- Lines 77-95: references to more recent high resolution structures of herpesvirus capsids are needed (CMV: Yu et al. 2017, Science 356:1350KHSV: Dai et al 2018, Nature 553:521). They provide also useful up-to-date information for interpretation of the pentons molecular organization. After the authors submitted their manuscript there were also two publications on the 6 April issue of Science that report atomic models of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 icosahedral capsids. These structures do not reveal the portal vertex structure but could be useful to refine the quality of the other capsid pentons structure shown in the present manuscript and their description (e.g. in the paragraph starting in line 97; in the refs given in lines 131, 134…). 4 - the authors shall define or give a reference for “focused-classification” (line 98 and thereafter) for the non-initiated. 5 – line 140: “a metadata file was created with expanded the icosahedral symmetry…” ?! 6 - The authors should describe in greater detail how the CATC could close the portal pore. In particular, they could compare the diameter of the gap through the UL25 rings with the diameter of a double stranded DNA and discuss whether this is sufficient for blocking DNA or not. This comparison could also be performed with the PVAT. 7- the CATC seems different in figure 2d and 2e, is it due to a different segmentation, a different density threshold or to another reason ? 8- Line 167-176: the authors should explain how they docked UL25 in the CATC density shown in movie 2, especially in the distal tier that seems to be less resolved. 9- Lines 208 to 231 : this discussion seems particularly long  with regard to its interest for the work presented (the main issue is to propose that pUL33 could be the unidentified portal-vertex protein), it should probably be significantly shortened. 10 – line 235: the authors shall explain in Methods how they determine the handedness of DNA organization inside the capsid based on their cryoEM reconstruction. 11 – line 272: the packing of DNA is very tight inside viral capsids reaching a high concentration  but its density does not change. Reviewer 3 The MS “Structure of the herpes-simplex 1 virus portal-vertex” by McElwee, Vijayakrishnan, Rixon and Bhella reports structures of a pathogenic herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) focusing  on the organization of its portal-vertex where is a portal protein complex located. The portal complex is a nano-motor accomplishing the packaging of the viral genome into the viral capsid during maturation process and later participating in the genome release into a host cell during infection. In this MS the authors shared their method of how to move from highly symmetrical models to the less symmetrical complexes. This important approach will definitely be used by other labs. The authors obtained two structures of the virus one with the icosahedral symmetry and another with symmetry C5. The last one revealed the portal vertex position. The novelty of the MS is in a detail description of how the orientations of particle images where analysed and modified to be applied to the structure with C5 symmetry. Usage of the lower symmetry during the reconstruction process has enabled the authors to see the handiness of the packaged DNA. The MS is sufficiently well written and explains the methodology used to obtain the C5 structure. However there are some questions related to the figures.  While the overall view of the HSV-1 is consistent with well-established facts, the details that are discussed in the MS are not seen on the presented pictures of the capsids and not shown or indicated on enlarged figures. The authors are discussing such fine details of the huge virus as bundles of four helices, but they (in spite a huge size of the figure attached) are not seen in the figures, and in the printed version of them, they are too small and they will be small in the final published version of the manuscript. All figures are poorly labelled. Lines 130-131 -> “a clear four-helix bundle that has been attributed to pUL17, pUL25 and pUL36” One can wonder why the authors did not provide any fitting of atomic models. The authors have to label where are these proteins are located. So these parts have to enlarged and clearly indicated, showing the differences between the icosahedral symmetry and C5. Figures 1a, 1b can be removed, surroundings in 1e -1h could be reduced allowing to make 5-fold views bigger and give room for labels. Figures are repetitive to the high extend. The authors have to show firstly the overall structures and then go to the details indicating the helices and position of proteins. The movies were unloadable. So it is unknown what do they show. Minor comments: Line 99. “replaced by a unique five-fold symmetric assembly” - >The authors have to be cautious, if the C5 symmetry has been imposed during the reconstruction process they will be not able to see if there are symmetry mismatches in the portal vertex. Overall symmetry will still be C5, but it is has been suggested while ago that the portal complex itself highly possible has symmetry C12, while the proteins that provide connections with the viral envelope and a host cell outer membranes may have a number of different symmetries varying from asymmetrical ring complexes via C2  to C6 rotational symmetric and may be other symmetries as well. Please rephrase the sentence, Line 144. Please explain what is that: “grouping the data into self-similar classes”. References would be helpful. Lines 155,161 and 164. How positions of the pUL17, pUL25 and pUL36 proteins were identified? How the authors assessed where and which part of densities were assigned to pUL36? Lines 172-173, “The distal (outermost) tier being rotated ~36o relative to the proximal one (movie S2)”. Possibly will be good to have a figure, the movie was unloadable. Line 180. Some confusion. What the authors mean: “we can see noisy density that we attribute to the porta protein pUL6”. How noise can be attributed to a protein? Possibly it was some indications of presence of the signal related to the Portal complex? Please explain and rephrase lines 180-185. Line 195. Please rephrase “Lying between the portal and the pUL25 PVAT density, a novel five-fold symmetric assembly replaces the usual pUL19 penton.” It is not a new assembly that replaces the penton, this is a complex that has been eventually found. It is highly possible that it does not have the 5-fold symmetry; otherwise it would be resolved better. Helices have to be shown and indicated in the figure. Lines 208-223 possibly should be moved into introduction, they are bit out of place. Lines 233-249 possibly fit better to the conclusions. Lines 243-245 “Our data suggest a reason for this, showing that pUL25 forms a double-layered cap on the outer face of the portal-vertex (the PVAT).” Figure would be helpful. One cannot see that cap in any of the figures. The authors have to illustrate their text and possibly provide a better explanation. Line 247 “pentameric portal-vertex protein complex” the authors do not have any proves, that the complex is pentameric. The symmetry has been imposed. Please rephrase the sentence in a more careful way. The authors repeat that again in the conclusions, but the emphasis on the 5-fold symmetry should to be avoided. Line 303. The dose has to be not per linear angstrom, but per square angstrom. Reviewer 4 The manuscript “Structure of the herpes-simplex 1 virus portal-vertex” by McElwee et al describes their structural analysis of the herpesvirus capsid portal vertex using cryo-electron microscopy to image capsids inside intact virions. This is a significant step forward for the field after a number of conflicting and low-resolution reports on the portal structure, and the present work answers several questions about this very important part of the herpesvirus capsid. The manuscript is well written and generally focused and rational. A significant limitation is that the 12-fold symmetry of the portal itself was not resolved and so the main conclusions are about the organization of the 5-fold symmetric capsid features around the vertex where they don’t interact directly with the symmetry-breaking portal itself. This is not to diminish the value of this work, and the title accurately reflects this situation, but I feel the authors may have made some inferences that are on less sound ground and which they may wish to reconsider. That aside, I believe the relevance of their work and its potential impact on the field well justifies publication by PLoS Biology. Of several points that would benefit from additional thought, the first is perhaps trivial but bears on the concept of capsid and tegument. The capsid proteins co-assemble and remain associated in the virion. Terminase subunits are clearly not capsid proteins because of their transitory association, and neither are tegument proteins because they form a compact but largely disordered layer outside the capsid and serve no known structural role in the capsid. Proteins that are intimately, specifically and symmetrically associated with the capsid would seem to include the variously named CCSC, CVSC and now CATC where the T stands for tegument. The subunits include pUL17 that is implicated in capsid assembly, and pUL25 that maintains the genome inside the capsid amongst other functions, and its not clear why the authors describe them as “tegument”. Certainly, adding another name to the list seems unnecessary. Similarly, is the PVAT that is composed of 10 copies of pUL25 really tegument since it is integral to the capsid portal vertex? The imposition of 5-fold symmetry naturally obscures interpretation of the 12-fold symmetric portal, but it also affects any interface where the symmetry of either side may be affected locally. This is evident, for example, in the asymmetric map of phi29 (ref [32]) where neither symmetry is appropriate in this region. Interpreting weaker density is fraught with the difficulty of knowing whether the symmetry mismatch or flexibility is responsible for fuzziness, and this bears on the identification of the density at the Ta position as another protein(s), the identification of pUL25 with the PVAT despite the poor quality of the fits (Supplemental Movie 2), and the claim of highly-ordered DNA packing in a left-handed spool. Indeed, imposition of 5-fold symmetry may be enhancing a spurious signal for the DNA – spherical sections might demonstrate the soundness of this density as surfaces such as those in Figure 3 may be misleading. In general, I feel the authors may want to moderate text about the weaker density in case their interpretations don’t hold up. A technical question – the so-called “gold-standard” Fourier shell correlation of 0.143 is used as a cut-off to give the most optimistic measure of resolution. However, the Methods do not state that the gold-standard method was applied during analysis, and this is essential to justify such a low correlation limit. Was the gold-standard method followed from start to finish? Alternatively, at 6.3 Å for the icosahedrally symmetrized map, helices should be evident as tubes, possibly with chirality and even possibly with density corresponding to large side-chains. Are such features observed in the density map? Further, with the reduction from 60-fold to 5-fold symmetry, the resolution was changed only to 7.7Å – wouldn’t a greater loss have been expected? How do the density maps compare to X-ray structures that have been filtered to these resolutions? A minor point on lines 91-95 – another significant reason why the herpesvirus portal has been hard to find is that it resembles a penton in size and mass, unlike in the dsDNA tailed phages where the portal is generally more massive relative to the pentamers of major capsid protein. Reference is made to the pUL6 portals being decameric (eg, line 183) and I believe the structure of the isolated portal by Trus et al, 2004, is relevant here, and could be compared with the density maps in general terms (recognizing that the Trus structure has 12-fold symmetry and the density map has 5-fold) – ie, would it fit, and can it be placed in the density? Can its directionality be assigned? Wording. There are a number of semantic and grammatical errors, including: Line 19: suggests virions may contain several capsids, which is possible but rare. Line 72: the colon should be a comma. Line 132: “one on top of the pUL19” means the pUL19 of a penton, as opposed to a hexon. Line 134: Reference [16] is not to PRV but instead to KSHV.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/07/386888#comment-5592378925,biorxivstage,2,"Some papers live a seemingly charmed life, while others encounter considerable resistance under peer review. To help readers understand the path to publication I have decided to share the reviews for all of my papers on BiorXiv. We first submitted this article to Nature Structural Molecular Biology, where it was declined without review.  We then submitted it to PLOS Biology, where it received favourable reviews: Reviewer #1: (Signed review - reviewer name is redacted) Ho et al provide a detailed structural description of Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV), a pathogen of fresh water prawns based on Virus-like-particles made with a baculovirus system programmed with the capsid protein gene of the virus. The close similarity between the VLP structure determined at 3.3Å and the authentic virus particles determined at 6.6Å resolution provide convincing evidence that the VLPs are good representations of the authentic virus. The highlight of the paper is the close similarity of the subunit organization and the capsid morphology to that of tomato bushy student virus (TBSV). Key features are the Arginine Rich Motifs (ARMs) of the C subunits that interact with RNA and are not visible, but sequentially precede an intricate series of subunit interactions mediated by residues following this region; the N-proximal shell (S) domain and the C-proximal protruding (P) domain. All of these features, as well as the dimer organization of the protruding domains and the metal ion stabilized shell domain interaction are far more reminiscent of the TBSV structure than the structure of other reported insect nodavirus structures. The technical quality of the paper is high and it is well written and illustrated. The arguments are convincing that the family nodaviridae, comprised of the alpha (primarily insect infecting viruses) and beta (primarily infecting aquatic species) genera, result from convergent evolution of these genera toward bipartite RNA particles that clearly display subunits and capsid organization that are distinctly different from each other, with the beta particles showing much closer similarity to TBSV-like viruses than the alpha nodavirus structure. The paper will be improved if the authors address the following points. 1.	They should reference Tang, L., Lin, C., Krishna, N., Yeager, M., Schneemann, A., and Johnson, J. 2002. Virus-like-particles of a fish nodavirus display a capsid subunit domain organization different from insect nodaviruses. J. of Virology 76:6370-6375. While these subunits formed trimeric interacting surface domains, the organization of the subunit domain structure was described as TBSV-like. 2.	The authors should provide more comparison with the beta nodavirus structure previously reported that they reference but do not discuss (Chen N-C, Yoshimura M, Guan H-H, Wang T-Y, Misumi Y, Lin C-C, et al. (2015) Crystal Structures of a Piscine Betanodavirus: Mechanisms of Capsid Assembly and Viral Infection. PLoS Pathog 11(10): e1005203). 3.	Inter S-domain stabilization by divalent cations is not unique to TBSV and was described in some detail for Flock House Virus (Banerjee, M., Speir, J. A., Kwan, M. H., Huang, R., Aryanpur, P. P., Bothner, B., and Johnson, J. E. 2010. Structure and function of a genetically engineered mimic of a nonenveloped virus entry intermediate. J Virol 84:4737-46.). The similarity between MrNV and TBSV is convincing, but the discussion could be expanded a bit. 4.	A striking difference between alpha and beta nodaviruses is that the former undergo a post assembly maturation cleavage that is required for infectivity. This activity does not appear to be present in beta nodaviruses and this should be pointed out and possibly commented on in terms of any potential homologous residues in the two genera now that there are two high resolution structures of beta nodavirses. Reviewer #2: The authors report the structure of a nodavirus infecting fresh water prawns, MrNV. The structure of virus-like particles (VLPs) reached 3.3 A resolution and the biological significance of this structure was validated by repeating the structure determination on the virus itself, purified from prawn post-larvae, at 6.6 A resolution. The VLP structure allowed modelling the atomic structure of the viral capsid. The manuscript discusses evolutionary considerations that are interesting to those working in the field of structural virology and viral evolution:  Unlike other nodavirus capsids that are built from trimeric capsomers, then MrNV capsid is built from dimeric capsomers. This structural difference reported by the authors earlier has raised the question whether the MrNV should be allocated to a new genus within Nodaviridae. This manuscript highlights further differences and intriguing parallels to the members of the Tombusviridae family. The work is technically of excellent quality and the manuscript is clearly written. However, I would move most of the detailed methods from the Results section to the Methods section (especially cryoEM). It would be beneficial if the Discussion could be developed further as now it somewhat just summarizes the results and has several unrelated minor points.  For instance it could be focused more around the evolutionary differences and similarities.  Where are the Ca2+ sites in tombusviruses and what is the similarity in other parts of the capsid protein? The strand-swapping seems unique to MrNV. It would be interesting to discuss the possible evolutionary origins of this – for instance are the interactions that this strand has with the neighbouring CP capsomer in MrNV similar to those that the equivalent strand has within the same capsomer in tombusviruses (see Bennett, et al. 1995 Protein Sci. 4, 2455–2468). Finally, it is not clear from the figures if the topology of the MrNV P-domain can be clearly seen in the EM map. As comparison to tombusviruses and similarity of the fold is a key part of the paper, it is essential to provide stronger evidence for this. Minor comments: Line 229: Please clarify what is meant by “unsupervised 3D refinement”? Please add FSC curve for the 6.6 A map and validation curves (phase randomization) for all FSC curves. Add supplementary Table for all EM statistics, including the B-factors used for sharpening of the maps. Reviewer #3: The authors present an atomic-resolution model of the Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus calculated by  cryo EM of virus-like particles (VLPs). MrNV is a pathogen of freshwater prawns that poses a threat to food-security and causes significant economic losses in the aquaculture industries of many developing nations.  VLP were produced in insect cells, and data were reconstructed to 3.3 Å resolution map. CryoEM of MrNV virions purified from infected freshwater prawn post-larvae yielded a 6.6 Å resolution structure confirming the biological relevance of the VLP structure. The manuscript is well written with especially clear descriptions of the structural organization and comparisons to other structures. Figure 3 in particular is nicely presented. This is an important and impressively reported effort. Minor: “S” and “P” domains are used first in Results section at about line 277 without definition. Fig 1 b (central section) is called to illustrate fuzzier density of P domain, but there is no label/arrow in Fig 1 b to show P domain location. For surface rendered maps in all figures, please add some type of label or axis indicator to designate symmetry axes to orient the reader.  A description of the orientation might be sufficient, if it is preferred by authors and editor in order to preserve the visual integrity of the maps. There is a clear and accurate statement in Results: “At this resolution, the (6.6Å) map appears identical to that of the MrNV VLP in all respects.”  However, elsewhere, the same accuracy is required.  Please adjust the Fig 7 legend where it states that “The authentic MrNV virion has an identical capsid structure to that of the VLP,”  and “…. was indistinguishable from the VLP reconstruction” since both statements need to include some mention of the qualification of achieved resolution or other softening term to acknowledge that your conclusion that these are  identical structures is highly probable, but cannot be stated conclusively due to the 6.6Å map.",2021-11-01T11:10:19,disqus_Ao3NahMvYd,David Bhella,,,,

I doubt that the right motor cortex has the same role for movements of the left arm and of the right arm.

Excellent work :-) I have only one quibble, relating to lines 329-333, i.e. the potential for conditional Y-linked drive. You show that it is possible for a Y-borne gene to favour transmission of the paternal X (and oppose transmission of the paternal Y) in matings between XY males and X*Y females. I think it would be worth pointing out that the paternal Y cannot be selected to drive against itself.  Rather, in this case the maternal Y is being selected to drive against the paternal Y. In the case of the two-step pathway (b2'+3), a Y-borne drive modifier can only invade the population if it acts in X*Y females, not if it acts in XY males, because it is the maternal copy of the Y that is favoured by the drive in these matings - the paternal copy is disfavoured. The same applies to the one-step pathway b2.  Even if a single Y-linked gene is responsible for both directions of conditional drive, if its only mode of action is by perturbing sperm function, then it will be rapidly selected to become an unconditional driver.  It must therefore act in X*Y females as well. This means that conditional drive almost certainly has two separate mechanisms of action: one acting paternally, and the other acting maternally. This makes the two-step pathway much more likely than the one-step pathway, and may give some clue towards tracking down the mechanism of action - the proposed mandarin vole system in ref 11 (maternal Y acts via imprinting to inactivate an essential gene on the X*, so only embryos that inherit a paternal X can survive) is a beautifully elegant solution, and blew my mind for a second time in one evening. I personally think the most likely course of events is: 1) Acquisition of unconditional Y-drive, acting paternally. We know that there is a paternally-acting sex ratio drive system in mus musculus, and some of the interacting partners (Sstx and Ssty) are also present in rat. So this is likely quite ancient. We also recently showed that the proximate mechanism for this is probably differential motility of X and Y-bearing sperm. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... 2) Appearance of a feminising X*, facilitated by the presence of Y drive 3) Development or enhancement of compensation in X*Y females to improve fertility via polyovulation. In a transgenic system that eliminates male embryos in the peri-implantation, we show that there is some inherent compensation of litter size in mus musculus. So it seems some element of poly-ovulation may be common in rodents, allowing for a certain amount of pre-/peri-implantation attrition without reducing litter size.  This seems like the sort of phenotype that could relatively easily be increased to allow greater levels of compensation. https://www.biorxiv.org/con... 4) Development of conditional drive in which X*Y females drive against the paternal Y Once compensation is well established in step 3, the X*Y mothers have more scope to eliminate even more embryos prior to implantation and thus select only the ones they want. Mechanistically, all this can be most readily tested by IVF and/or embryo transplantation experiments - are these techniques established for mus minutoides yet?

However, we have to point out that there is a big misunderstanding of our published work. First of all, asymmetric histones do NOT imply the existence of “immortal histones” as the authors hypothesized and used to make predictions in their experimental design. In fact, distinguishing old versus new canonical histone must be in the context of cell cycle progression: Old refers to the pre-existing histones before S phase and new refers to newly incorporated ones during S phase. These two populations can be distinguished by the tag-switch or photoconversion methods only after the switched or converted cell goes through one complete S phase and enters the subsequent M phase. Moreover, the new histones with switched or converted labels will mature over time during cell cycle and gain old histone features, and thus there are no “immortal” histones. However, we are not seeing any labels in this work that indicate active cell cycle progression, which is very concerning given these tissues are ex vivo for more than 40 hours. Second, it would be highly appreciated if the authors include germline versus somatic cell markers in their figures. As of now, it is impossible to tell whether the weak H3 signals in Figure 1C and 1E come from germ cells or somatic gonadal cells. The bright spot in Figure 3E was interpreted as hub cells, which are quiescent somatic cells. If this is the case, it would be very strange that such a quick old to new H3 turn-over occurs in these cells, as indicated in Figure 3E legend. Finally, we have to point out that our previous results were entirely misinterpreted in the “Alternative Hypothesis 2” in Figure 2, because we are not assigning random stem cells (GSC) and progenitor cells (SG) together as pairs — all GSC-GB pairs we analyzed are still connected by the spectrosome structure (Tran et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2015; Wooten et al., 2019), indicating that they are daughter cells derived from one GSC division. Furthermore, our previous conclusions were not solely based on the post-mitotic GSC-GB pairs, but also on stem cells undergoing asymmetric cell divisions, based on fixed and live cell imaging. In summary, this work is based on both misunderstanding and misinterpretation of our work, leading to an incorrect hypothesis. Additionally, there is no single dividing stem cell or a pair of daughter cells derived from stem cell division shown in this work that can lead to the conclusion of “Symmetric Inheritance of Histones H3 in Drosophila Male Germline Stem Cell Divisions”. We hope these comments clarify several critical points for both the authors and the readers of this preprint. Thank you for your attention!

A few comments and questions: Missing: citation to Berck, Khandelwal et al. 2016 eLife, which describes the connectome of the olfactory glomeruli of the antennal lobe of Drosophila larva. Note that Eichler et al. 2017 Nature describes the mushroom body connectome, not the olfactory glomeruli. Missing from the simulations are LN-LN synapses, LN-ORN synapses, and PN-LN dendro-dendritic synapses. Perhaps the SFA (spike frequency adaptation) models the LN-ORN synapse and possibly the PN-LN synapse in its role in driving the LN-PN and LN-ORN synapse? Why wasn't SFA implemented in PNs as well? Why only ORNs and KCs? What is the Q_0.75 ? Never defined. Which brain hemisphere was modeled, the left or the right? ""The ORN responses are phasic-tonic as a result of SFA."": what does this mean? From figure 2 one can infer perhaps an early strong onset of activity (the phasic part), followed by sustained but weaker activity (the tonic part). Could be explained rather than leave the reader to guess. In which figure is this shown: ""The integrated adaptation current that has reached a steady state during the odor stimulation period now decays only slowly, acting in a hyperpolarizing fashion and thus reducing spiking probability [52] of the ORNs."" Repeated word: ""on the the sparseness"" In Figure 3, rather than dynamite plots, it would be best to show the cloud of 20 dots, with some horizontal jitter, for each condition, to better visually assess the spread of the distributions. Typo: ""inhibtion"" Missing parentheses: ""for both chip Fig. 4 A,B,C and simulation Fig. 4 C,D,E."" That's very interesting: ""new neuromorphic circuit designs will be able to compensate for these drifts by using proper temperature compensated bias generator circuits [102]."" and it mirrors recent findings in Drosophila larvae where the temperature sensors for both cold and hot maintain homeostasis. Note the thermosensors communicate as well to the APL via PNs and two KCs per mushroom body, which happen to be the largests KCs in this animal.

I also am curious about the organoid model utilized to test this concept. Was there any other differences observed to make sense of the bone tissue migration compared to the breast cancer tissue migration? Does it overall seem like this process could very well happen in all types of cancer outside of the breast cancer cells tested? This specific data, while very important to understanding mechanistically what is going on with this mitochondrial transfer, I think needs more clarity quantitatively or qualitatively. If we were too look at this phenomenon in vivo are there going to be confounding factors that perhaps change this transfer process? This could potentially start to explain why there are differences in transference patterns observed between tissue types.

Thank you for contributing to global terrestrial biomonitoring and ecological analysis. Using airDNA as a biomonitoring tool under natural settings show great potential. The decline in biodiversity throughout the world urges the development of non-invasive techniques that could offer rapid and accurate results. Your study successfully reveals the power of airDNA sampling at distance, and from my perspective, the new technique would truly revolutionize terrestrial biodiversity surveys. My question would be, do you anticipate any difference of conducting airDNA sampling between zoo setting and real natural environment? As in the zoo, animals are gathering together and each kind of them have their own enclosures. While in the natural environment, animals will move more freely as there will be no space limit. Also, we know that some endangered species actually live under extreme conditions. For example, the weather might be extreme. Will the study results be influenced by extreme weathers? Moreover, I am wondering if we need more intermediate steps to shift from zoo setting to actual field as zoo setting can evoke less complex behaviors and is still involved by human. Since we are aiming at non-invasive technique, what future steps could be done?

Not to mention, the production of a shelf-stable, oral vaccine would be a great contribution to current global vaccination efforts. The experiment design was planned and executed well to imitate and evaluate post-vaccination transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, after thoroughly reading the paper, I was left searching for answers that would provide clarity to readers such as myself should they be addressed. The first is regarding the use of an adenovirus type 5 vector when a large proportion of the population already has natural immunity to this serotype. Is there a benefit to using this vector as opposed to another subtype with less seroprevalence in the population? The second unanswered question is regarding the IM vaccine used. Why was a SARS-CoV-1 spike protein vaccine used instead of a vaccine that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, such as one of the current mRNAs vaccines currently in use? My third unanswered question is regarding the high virus titer used to inoculate index hamsters. What was the rationale behind inoculating hamsters with a high physiological dose as opposed to a moderate dose that may better represent the amount that humans are actually exposed to? A thought, not a question, but many of the experiments performed on samples were collected at several timepoints, yet the sVNT was performed at only 1 timepoint following full vaccination. It would have been informative had the sVNT been performed on samples from week 4 to determine the neutralizing ability of antibodies in between vaccinations and to compare to IgA and IgG levels which were determined at that time point. As a final lingering question, IN- and oral- vaccinated index hamsters inoculated with the high dose viral titer showed more effective viral clearance than naïve hamsters that were exposed to these same index hamsters in the aerosol chambers. And as seen in figures 4b-g, though high viral and infectious viral loads were detected in the naïve hamsters they were protected from severe clinical disease outcomes at day 5 post-challenge. However, the same data from figure 4 b-d also seem to show that the unvaccinated, naïve hamsters were not protected from viral infection transmitted via aerosols from the infected, IN- and oral- vaccinated index hamsters. Yet, one of the conclusions from the paper is that IN- and oral- vaccinated index hamsters transmitted less aerosolized infectious virus to unvaccinated naïve hamsters. Have I misinterpreted the data from figures 4b-d?

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.04.458989v1#comment-5581285647,biorxivstage,0,"This manuscript examines the role of steroid hormones in regulating exit from the dauer diapause state in C. elegans. The manuscript presents a careful examination of partial dauers made by daf-9 mutants that are deficient in dafachronic acid (DA) steroid hormone production, concluding that these partial dauers are dauers that have initiated but failed to complete dauer exit, and that thus, complete exit from dauer requires DA steroid hormones. These major conclusions of the paper are well-supported by the experimental evidence. Convincing experiments demonstrate that daf-9 mutants make full dauers in unfavorable conditions, that these animals then become partial dauers when shifted to favorable conditions, and that many daf-9 partial dauers formed in favorable conditions transit through a transient full dauer state on their way to becoming partial dauers. Finally, it is shown that DA steroid hormones promote exit of arrested daf-9 partial dauers. This is a solid study and my critiques are all relatively minor. Minor Points 1. The paper could be clearer on precisely how daf-9 and DA steroid hormones are required for dauer exit. Though it is true that daf-9 and DA are required for “complete” dauer exit as accurately stated in the Abstract, the take-home message of the paper often seems to be that daf-9 and DAs are required for “dauer exit” without getting into the nuance of which aspect of exit (e.g. lines 143-144 and elsewhere). The idea that DA hormones are required for exit is unintuitive and paradoxical given that daf-9 mutants actually initiate dauer exit rapidly under favorable conditions. Though the paper is generally careful in the precise way it talks about exit, I think it would be clearer to explicitly state the precise role of daf-9 and DA in dauer exit as follows. Based on the data in this paper, I would argue that there are two steps to dauer exit, only one of which depends on daf-9 and steroid hormones. First, an animal needs to initiate dauer exit, which leads it from the full dauer state to the partial dauer state. This step does not seem to require DA steroid hormones as daf-9 mutants initiate dauer exit from the full dauer state to the partial dauer state rapidly. Instead, this initial exit is likely regulated in a similar way as dauer entry – it is blocked by high levels of dauer pheromones, or in Daf-c mutants like daf-2 and daf-7. When pheromone is low (“favorable conditions”) initial exit occurs to the partial dauer state in a DA-independent fashion, and then there is a second stage of regulation going from partial dauers to non-dauers. daf-9 and DA steroid hormones are both necessary and sufficient for this second step, exiting from the partial dauer stage and resuming reproductive development. In one sense, it could be argued that daf-9 and DAs are required for full “execution” of dauer exit, not the “decision” to exit (just as daf-16 partial dauers are sometimes suggested to be defective in the execution of dauer formation rather than the decision). So ultimately, the action of DA hormones is required for reproductive development, whether it is to bypass dauer entirely at the L2 stage or whether it is to fully recover after forming dauers. 2. Some figures would benefit from non-dauer controls. For example, in Fig 2, it would be nice to see the pharynx width, speed, and pumping frequency of non-dauer L3s as a comparison. Without these controls, it isn’t clear which aspects of the daf-9 phenotype are dauer-like vs. non-dauer. Similarly, in Fig 3E, the daf-9 partial dauers have a speed similar to the recovered WT dauers. After 24 hours in favorable conditions, I would think the WT would be at L4 stage (i.e. fully non-dauer), yet this is one piece of evidence that daf-9 full dauers can become partial dauers upon a shift to favorable conditions. So does a partial dauer move at the same speed as an L4? If so, speed would not be a very useful measure in defining an animal as a partial dauer because it wouldn’t distinguish partial dauers and non-dauers. Including a WT L4 control would be useful. Pumping frequency in 3F is clearly less for daf-9 partial dauers than recovered WT dauers (presumed L4), but what about pharynx width shown in 3G? Is that more like a dauer or a non-dauer? Again, a WT L4 control would be useful. 3. Related to point 2 above, it would be nice to show that WT dauers at early stages of recovery (much less than 24 hours) resemble daf-9 partial dauers. That would demonstrate there is likely nothing abnormal or incomplete about daf-9 partial dauers and really nail the idea that the daf-9 partial dauer phenotype is due to defects in dauer exit rather than dauer formation. 4. Though strong evidence is presented that some daf-9 partial dauers transit through a transient dauer state (Fig. 4), it also seems likely based on the data in Figs 4 and S2 that daf-9 can also go from an L2d to a partial dauer without becoming a full dauer, though this possibility is not discussed. This raises several questions. Are the daf-9 partial dauers formed at 20° without going through a full dauer state (Fig S2) different than those formed at 25.5° (Fig 4)? If WT L2d are shifted to favorable growth conditions before becoming dauer, do they go through a partial dauer state that resembles daf-9 mutants? Do daf-9 L2d look the same as WT L2d? 5. Related to point 4 above, the presumed daf-9 mutant L2d pharynx shown in Fig 4B looks somewhat slim – a WT L2d pharynx photo would be useful as comparison. 6. It is stated twice (lines 130 and 157) that there is only “anecdotal evidence” that daf-9(dh6) and daf-12(rh273) mutants form full dauers under unfavorable conditions. However, the two papers cited (Antebi et al.1998; Gerisch et al. 2001) both have tables with quantitative data showing full dauers formed in these mutants under starvation conditions. I would suggest to not use the phrase “anecdotal evidence.” 7. Lines 348-350: it is suggested that DA does not promote exit of full daf-9 dauers in the presence of pheromone because of inaccessibility of DA. Though this is possible, another possibility is that DA only promotes dauer exit after an initial decision to exit that does not occur in the presence of pheromone (see point 1 above). 8. It appears that the WT and daf-9 full dauer speed data shown in Fig 2C may be the same data shown in Fig 3E. If so, this should be stated explicitly, and any other data reused between different figure panels should be stated. Were all the data in Fig 3E from experiments performed in parallel? If not, this should be stated. 9. It would be helpful to show DIC micrographs of the pharynx without the yellow outline drawn on top since it is very hard to see the pharynx boundaries with the drawn outline (Figs 2A, 3G, 4B, S3). I would recommend a supplementary figure showing the same images without the outline. 10. It is unclear which daf-9 mutant is shown in Fig 3G (presumably dh6 but not stated). Please state this in the legend. 11. It would be helpful to state in the Fig 6C legend that these are WT dauers, not daf-9 dauers. 12. I was confused by Fig 7D. It seems that the presence of the UAS::ICE transgene promotes dauer exit, regardless of the presence of the XXX cGAL driver, which seems odd. Then I read in the Methods that dauers with the UAS::ICE transgene are SDS-sensitive. Are these real full dauers or partial dauers? If they aren’t normal full dauers, it seems questionable using them in an assay on dauer exit. Perhaps the UAS::ICE integration site or a mutation in that background caused by integration affect the dauer state? Given these concerns, I would recommend cutting this experiment from the paper. The laser ablation experiment in Fig 7C is much cleaner. 13. In Fig S3, it is stated that the labeled neuron is actually due to bleedthrough of RFP in a coinjection marker. This coinjection marker should be listed in the genotype of this strain in Table S1. Also, it appears that there might also be some GFP in the posterior pharynx in this image. Any explanation?

You cite reference 23, which is Cutiongco et al. 2019 ( https://doi.org/10.1038/s41..., and state: ""The assumption is that cells with more similar morphological features (e.g. cell size, nuclei size, granularity, or distribution) also have more similar transcriptional profiles23"" In Cutiongco et al., they tested 14 genes, and observed that they were associated with concomitant morphological changes as a result of different nanotopographies. I am not sure if this relationship will hold true for other genes and especially, outside of using nanotopography as an environmental stimulus. Also, evidence from other domains indicates that morphological differences may not necessarily indicate large gene expression differences (see Que et al. 2020: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41... where they found only 9 genes differentially expressed between neurons with different morphologies). I suppose my point is that the field needs more evidence of the linkage expectation between expression and morphology, and, to the extent that this assumption impacts normalization, I would be a bit weary of over-interpretation.",2021-10-22T17:33:40,gregoryway,Gregory Way,,,,

Just two quick comments on figure 6 suppl 4 : 1) there is a microscopic reversibility issue in the kinetic scheme, which would be solved by increasing the AD --> ADI by 10^3 fold (i.e. k'on.10^3 rather than k'on) 2) by increasing 1000 fold the desensitization on-rate, it seems you are decreasing the lifetime of the open state rather than stabilizing the desensitized state (of course, there is a thermodynamic shift in favour of the desensitized state, but it doesn't sound to me like a stabilization in a kinetic sense). My bet is that if you rather decrease the desensitization recovery rate (d-), akin what you did for the flipped state in fig 6 suppl 3, you will end up with a similar observation to what we had for our 2018 review (GLIC & DHA): pretty much no effect on the peak current following preapplication of the inhibitor.

As I was reading the paper and the main point of Polypolish is to reduce errors in repetitive regions, I was almost sure that Merqury was going to be used to assess the error reduction. Have you heard about it before? I have not heard of ALE before, but by your description, it seems a mapping-based score, which would skew to non-repeats. I think Merqury might be a better fit because it is kmer-based, and thus it does not suffer from the mapping bias. Among other things, Merqury can provide a global QV score for your assembly, comparing the assembly kmer spectra to the short-reads kmer spectra. I suspect Merqury's QV scores can better reflect the reduction in repeat regions. Furthermore, I wonder what one can achieve if you use both metrics. Being ALE a good representative of non-repetitive error reduction and Merqury's QVs of the global error reduction, one might think that something like the ratio or the difference of both could directly correlate to error reduction in repetitive regions. Although one would have to think about how to normalize the metrics to make them comparable, I think it is still an idea worth exploring. I hope this comment helps and I wish you the best.

I feel like it is hard to draw comprehensive conclusions based on this experimental design. Even if under this condition, cell proliferation decreased, you can only conclude that ROS leads to increased cell proliferation, so transferred mitochondria can lead to cell proliferation through ROS accumulation, but you cannot eliminate the possibility that transferred mitochondria can induce cell proliferation through other mechanisms. I think another way to do it would be in cancer cells transferred or not transferred with mitochondria, either somehow knocking out all ROS or not knocking out all ROS, and comparing four experimental group’s proliferation state with each other.
