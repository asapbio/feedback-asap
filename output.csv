The authors establish an invertebrate model of gut colonization, which potentially has multiple benefits over current mouse models (e.g., lower cost, reduced ethical concern, simpler upkeep, less training needed); with further development, this model could be impactful for studies of infection by Enterobacteriaceae species. The presentation of the data throughout the paper is clear, and the data quality is good. The main conclusions of this paper are supported by the data. However, the choice of strains and antibiotics mean that there are a limited number of datapoints to address clearance of bacteria using antibiotic or bacteriophage treatment. Furthermore, more work is necessary to confirm the utility of this model system in recapitulating human infection and for determining the efficacy of potential treatments. Major Comment: In Figure 7, it would be helpful to include additional strain-antibiotic/phage combinations. The combinations already tested mostly involve strains that are inherently resistant to antibiotic or phage (e.g., Kp 419614 is resistant to both antibiotics, and Kp 14520 is resistant to both phages), limiting the information that can be gleaned from these experiments, including the relative efficacy of antibiotic and phage treatments. It would be informative to also test antibiotics that the strains are all susceptible to, and/or to include strains that are not resistant to the chosen antibiotics and bacteriophages. Minor Comments: 1. Table 1 does not have units for what we presume are MICs. 2. Can the authors comment more on the normal microbiome composition of G. melonella, and specifically whether there are any species that could potentially outcompete the K. pneumoniae or E. coli strains used in the study? Suggestions for Additional Experiments: 1. It would be informative to compare a range of bacteriophage and antibiotic concentrations in the experiment shown in Figure 7. 2. The authors use the same infectious doses (10^5 and 10^6) for the additional two Kp strains and three E. coli strains based on the determined effective dose for Kp14520. It would be worthwhile to determine the optimal infectious doses for each of the other strains. 3. It would be interesting to see the impact of bacteriophage treatment on colonization when the larvae are injected with the bacteria (rather than force-feeding). 4. It would be interesting to examine the microbiome composition of the larvae and the impact of bacteriophage treatment on microbiome composition.",2023-06-01T23:23:29,disqus_y9FR6hyg5J,Joseph Wade,10.1101/2023.03.27.534343,Bacteriophage-mediated decolonization of Enterobacteriaceae in a novel Galleria mellonella gut colonization model,"Kamran A.

We minimized the contribution of uncertainty in the data to the monomorphic category by setting strict criteria for minimum sample sizes for each sex in each species (based on our analysis of a larger dataset, see Fig. S1), such that most species in the monomorphic category with high variance should be those that actually have high variation in adult body mass in nature (and if high actual variance is paired with a relatively small difference in mean body mass, this should qualify them as functionally monomorphic).

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.04.531015v2#comment-6191092917,biorxivstage,0,"Summary: In protein engineering projects, it is always desirable to screen as efficiently as possible. Screening a relatively small number of variants becomes especially important when enzyme activity cannot be coupled to a high throughput sequencing readout. The major goal of the paper is to provide a proof of concept scoring and filtering system for selecting among proteins generated using computational methods to meet this challenge of efficient screening. They consider proteins generated using 2 machine learning methods and one phylogenetic method (ancestral reconstruction). The end result is a scoring filter combining the language model ESM-1v (which uses only sequence information) and the deep learning method ProteinMPNN (which is trained directly to find the most probable amino acid for a protein backbone predicted by AlphaFold2). After accounting for some simple idiosyncrasies of merging generative models with reality (ensuring starts with Met, removing repetitive sequences, accounting for localization signals) with heuristics, their filtering steps results in an enrichment of active sequences. The major success of the paper is a pipeline that actually works for selecting active sequences both in the experiments they conduct and (to some extent) literature examples. The table of potential protein failure modes is particularly useful as a baseline approach and reference for people designing sequences with computational methods. It is especially insightful to see how few deliberate filtering steps in the training process can have a big change in the outcome. We expect that a combination of sequence and structure-based filters will be used for prioritizing screening resources in the future. This paper lights the way of how to do that. The next steps will be to take into account structural features beyond stability (which is presumably covered by the AF2/ProteinMPNN), such as catalytic residue positioning, pocket size complementarity to substrate, etc. These are presumably implicitly captured by ESM-1. The next logical step (beyond this paper) is to go beyond statistical combination of these two scoring features to account for such features explicitly or with a new integrated deep learning approach. Major points: We are a bit confused about the exact value and sequencing of each part of the selection/filtering pipeline. We interpret experiment 3 as: Apply ESM-1v and Quality Filters and then apply a ProteinMPNN filter on top of that. Select Negative Controls by selecting sequences that fail the first filter (ESM-1v and Quality Filters) but are within 1% sequence identity to the closest natural sequence for some positive. The quality checks discussed in the supplementary information seem to have substantial impact. If the selected control sequences failed this quality check, it’s not clear whether the success of the pipeline is due to these heuristic quality checks or due to the computational filtering. These filters are biologically simple such as starting with a methionine, removing long repeats and not having a transmembrane domain - and it is kind of amusing to one of us (JF) that generative models have these pathologies so commonly. More discussion on why these filters were applied and what the distribution of effects were for the quality filters vs the insilico filters would help clarify the impact of each stage. This confusion then extends to determining how each of the two computational methods affect the selection. The authors contend that “no single metric would be sufficiently generalizable to screen against multiple sequence failure modes” and hypothesize that ProteinMPNN and ESM-1v “may capture distinct features.” However, because negative controls were selected only after failing the initial ESM + Quality Filters, its impossible to know what effect adding ProteinMPNN on top of ESM had. This is even more relevant given that the structures used to obtain proteinMPNN scores are first generated with Alphafold.  Alphafold can be computationally intensive (expensive to run) and therefore it is imperative that we understand how much this part of the pipeline contributes to the overall success of the selection process. The authors themselves contend that “Structure-supported metrics, including Rosetta-based scores, AlphaFold residue-confidence scores, and likelihoods computed by neural network inverse folding models, take into account protein atom coordinates potentially directly capturing protein functionality, however, they can be impractical to compute, especially when evaluating thousands of novel sequences.” This is something that can potentially be teased out. In the case of the paper only 200 proteins were selected using ProteinMPNN, however, if many sequences end up passing the ESM filter and budget allows it would be within reason to expand this random ESM selection. In summary, it is a bit hard to tell (without some ablation studies) which different pipeline components and filters drive the results. Additionally, it would have helped if these same quality filters were applied in Round 2 but that doesn’t seem to be the case? A deeper discussion on the selection of quality filters would also point the way forward with combining more “functional” structural features as outlined above. Minor points: 1) The author’s generalize the results with a few literature examples:  “similar results were obtained by independently validating COMPSS on previously published datasets of six enzyme families generated by models not considered in the present study.” Looking at the results in more detail reveals that some of these (including one that we generated!) are very small samples and this caveat should be discussed. In 3 out of the 6 studies, only 1 sequence was selected by their pipeline. In another of the 6, 2 were selected. In all 4 of these studies, a number of actives were missed. The limited number of selected sequences makes it hard to know how effective the pipeline really is in these 4 studies. Further, with such a stringent filter is not practical especially when we consider the fact that the authors don’t discuss the level of activity across positive and negative active compounds. It’s entirely possible that you could miss very active sequences and select only moderately active sequences. In one retrospective, the results were truly similar, however in the last other study, the filters worked far from intended. Even more, my team has observed in its own work that the sensitivity of machine learning models for scoring can be heavily dependent on the sequences the models have seen before. It would have been useful for the authors to consider how the tested enzymes overlap with the model training data to understand whether these scorers generalize outside the models training distribution. 2) The authors largely discount natural sequence identity as a metric: “Surprisingly, neither sequence identity to natural sequences nor AlphaFold2 residue-confidence scores were predictive of enzyme activity.” I think it’s important to qualify this with the fact that we are looking at sequences in the 70 to 90% range with very little dynamic range here. In their first experiment they looked at sequences in the 70 to 80 range. in their second they look at sequences in the 80 to 90 range. In their third experiment they looked at sequences in the 50 to 80 range but their filters end up selecting for sequences in the 70-80 range anyways. So it’s possible that locally, identity might not select for select for activity but globally, it could be a first filtering step on its own (which maybe is obvious and hence why it’s not more qualified?). Also to note is that sequence identity seemed to fare as well as or better than other metrics in identifying functional GAN-generated sequences and could be its own generative method: More problematic I think is figure 3f and figure 3g: It seems like the inactive controls are largely in a separate part of the tree compared to the active sequences passing and control. Does this have anything to do with the fact that these features failed the sequence based quality filters. Second,it suggests an approach where if you have some idea of where to focus on in the tree you could use sequence identity to those natural sequences as a metric for selection . Of course this information may not be readily available but the authors should discuss whether we could have hypothesized that the failing controls would have failed beforehand by considering their phylogenetic origins. Technical points: 1) There is some problem with this sentence: “CuSOD training sequences had only a single Sod_Cu domain, while MDH had an Ldh_1_N followed by an Ldh_1_C domain and no other Pfam domains that generally only rarely occur in 6.3% and 1.7% of sequences in both families, respectively.” It’s much better captured in the supplementary material: “For CuSOD, 1,632 out of 25,701 proteins (6.3%) had aberrant architectures. For MDH, 1,127 out of 65,639 (1.7%) had aberrant architectures.” 2) It’s not clear where/how they selected the natural test sequences for rounds 1 and 2. We assume it’s from the curated set of data but that’s not necessarily a given, further it seems that in round2, sequences were selected to span the range of esm scores. Was this done for the test natural sequences as well? “Only 13 test natural sequences were selected, as we had already screened five similar natural sequences in the remediation for Round 1.” “Besides the identity range, the experimentally tested sequences were selected to span the entire range of scores on each metric (Supplementary Table 4)” 3) The authors should be more explicit on the natural sequence identities in each round. If you check the supplement you can find this information if you pay attention to the figures or check the supplement but I think that it should be explicitly stated in the section “Round 2: Calibration data for COMPSS” that sequences are selected in the 80-90 range and in Round3 that the filters resulted in sequences with >69% identity. 4) The following section is confusing: “To further test the hypothesis that poor truncation selection was responsible for the lack of observed activity in the Round 1 CuSOD natural test sequences, we assayed an additional 16 natural SOD proteins (pre-test group)…” It should be stated at the beginning that 14 of the 16 test sequences are CuSOD sequences and 2 of the sequences are FeSOD sequences vs letting the reader figure that out later in the paragraph. Additionally, it would help the audience to say explicitly that 3/7 bacterial sequences with clipping also passed or include the table from the supplement up front. 3/7 doesn’t seem clearly distinct from 4/5. 5) What’s the reason for changing the esm-msa sampling method in round 2? Did they observe some benefit or was this purely a computational choice? 6) I think the text for a and b are switched in the figure 2 description. a is the AUC figure and  b is the correlation figure. Further for figure a If the test sequences are natural sequences, is the identity score meaningless here? 7) From the supplement: “We skipped the 'starts with M' filter because very few of the sequences in these sets start with M, and did not subset by identity to closest training sequence.” This modification to the pipeline should be mentioned in the discussion of the external validation tests. Or they should speculate what would happen if they just added a M at the beginning of every sequence? 8) Looking at the figures in the supplement e.g. Fig 30 it seems like they had quantitative activity values. It would have been nice to discuss if there was any correlation between scores and activity for ranking purposes. Was this not included because of variance in the assay?

This work potentially adds new pieces to the complex AD puzzle, showing that brain ACE2 levels correlates with AD pathology in two different cohorts of humans. Furthermore, the study shows that the spatial distribution of ACE2 in the brain of humans differs from mice, which has important implications for translational studies.The manuscript is also very well written, so it was easy for me to understand the main hypothesis, methods, results and author's conclusions, although I don't completely agree with some interpretations. For example, I agree that ACE2 may play a role in AD pathophysiology. This is corroborated by previous data (discussed by the authors in lines 419-435) and new data from this present study, showing that brain levels of soluble ACE2 (sACE2) were positively correlated with Aβ and tau neuropathology in humans, but inversely correlated with cognitive scores. However, I have some concerns regarding the authors' hypothesis that higher levels of sACE2 in AD patients might contribute to higher risk of CNS SARS-CoV-2 infection. So I have some questions and suggestions that I would like to share (I hope they contribute to your study): Major points 1) The manuscript suggests that increased levels of ACE2 in individuals with AD may increase the risk of CNS SARS-CoV-2 infection, since the SARS-CoVs use ACE2 as entry point into host cells. However, no alterations was observed in the levels of membrane ACE2 (i.e. in detergent-soluble fractions), although  higher levels of sACE2 was reported. I believe that the role of sACE2 was not properly discussed in the paper, but this is fundamental for the interpretation of your results. a) Where are most of TBS-soluble ACE2 in the AD brain? Inside or outside the cell? New data on this could help in the interpretation of current findings. b) If the receptor predominates in the extracellular parenchyma, as suggested in the lines 451-455, would they be acting as a decoy receptor or increasing SARS-CoV-2 infection by presenting the virus to host cells? There is an interesting literature on this, with some conflicting findings, but relevant to this discussion. These points are important to understand whether higher levels  of sACE2 would be a detrimental or compensatory/protective mechanism. 2) In the present study,  the APOE4 allele was present in 45% of individuals with AD (vs. 9% in control group in the cohort #1; p < 0.01). Accordingly, APOE4 is the greatest  genetic risk factor for AD. Recent findings indicate that APOE4 also correlate clinically with COVID-19 severity through interaction with ACE2 and/or modulation of ACE2 expression (Signal Transduct Target Ther. 2022 Aug 1;7(1):261 / J Transl Med. 2023 Feb 9;21(1):103).  Thus, it would be interesting to assess whether APOE4 also influences brain levels of ACE2 in the cohorts. 3) It is important to provide information about the race/ethnicity of the individuals enrolled in the present study, since African Americans/Black and Hispanic populations are at higher risk to have AD and experience disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related mortality. Also, I think it is important to consider in the Discussion possible limitations of the study, such as not being able to measure the impact that medications for AD may have on ACE2 expression. Finally, I believe that in vitro experiments could greatly contribute to the understanding of possible cellular mechanisms by which Aβ and/or tau can affect ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection independent of other factors (e.g. age, obesity, DM, APOE genotype and some medications). Furthermore, I would like to emphasize my congratulations on the manuscript: it was an enjoyable read!

I really liked the clarity of the figures and the step-by-step explanation of each method used, as well as the confirmation of background information through the different methodologies.

The advancement of combination drug therapy in targeting cancer cells and affecting cell proliferation is very promising, not just for LUAD but for different types of cancers, as mentioned in the paper. Although the research conducted was clear and thoroughly explained, the figures were a bit confusing to understand and could have benefitted from supplementary figures or further clarification of their intended meaning. Some figures did not mention the significance of the data, while others did. It was challenging to differentiate which sets of data were significant and which ones were not, as some contained ""ns"" (not significant) and others were left blank. Additionally, figures like Figure 4a included significance markers without an explanation of why the data was considered significant in the first place.

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the disease COVID 19, various vaccines and treatments have been developed that have been shown to be effective in reducing risk and severity of clinical outcome. Some limitations of current COVID19 treatment options is the inconsistency of their therapeutic efficacy across strains as well as possible unknown off-targets. To address these concerns, the use of llama-derived nanobodies (Nbs) has become of interest. Nbs have been shown to have a high affinity and specificity for targets, therefore decreasing risk of effects coming from possible unknown off-targets. In this study, llama-derived Nbs capable of neutralizing several SARS-CoV-2 strains were identified. In the In vivo model, Nbs were indicated to effectively induce protection in several lung tissues including the brain. These findings suggest Nbs as possible therapeutic agents for protection and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Positive feedback. This paper looked at the exciting research area of advancement upon monoclonal antibodies through Nbs. The researchers did a thorough job of explaining the genomic structure of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the interaction occurring during the initial attachment phase (lines 58-66). An exciting advancement of this study was the identification and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Nbs. These findings were made more impressive with their consistency found among varying strains as well as in both in vivo and in vitro design models. The use of several strains is important as individual strains can have very different effects and outcomes. The figures were nice with the appropriate size (not too small) being used for readability and the layout was not overwhelming with not too many figures being placed together (example Figure 3). I also liked the color scheme used as even though similar ones were used, varying shades were used to clearly contrast such as magenta as opposed to a lighter pink (example Figure 3 D). I especially liked Figure 10 for its ability to encapsulate a lot of information. The authors did a good job of explaining their research to those outside the field. The methods used to derive antibodies was well explained and will be helpful for those who would like to expand upon the research using this methodology. Major Concerns Different sources of S protein were used for different immunization points. Example the first two immunizations used were from one source and then third immunization is obtained using S protein from a different source. Moreover, they mention that the S protein parts encoded on expressed vectors are slightly different, how? (page 5 line 110) Authors should provide more detail into plasmids used, a table of recombinant proteins being used would be good. This is important as it probably represents the variability observed in Figure 2 when showing S protein binding of nanobodies. For Figure 6, an interpretation was not given in the discussion. It was mentioned that the Delta variant was not able to be neutralized by any of the non-RBD binders (pg. 11 line 279), but the researchers did not revisit this to share any hypothesis as to why this might be happening. In Figure 2, it might be good to see raw data and a correlation coefficient (R^2) to see how good the fit is. It might be helpful to include Km in the figure instead of just in a table. Proper positive controls in protection experiments are missing. For example, protection against various SARS-CoV2 variants with new nAbs could be compared with existing tools, e.g., mAbs used in clinic and/or current antivirals. Otherwise, it is hard to know whether the new tools are better than existing ones. Minor concerns The researchers briefly discussed ways in which their current work could be expanded upon (line 443-446), but did not mention the current limitations of their study. Discussing limitations is helpful for the reader in better understanding the results from the paper. What are some other routes that nanobodies can be introduced into the mouse besides intranasally? Will this route translate to humans? Full organs were used for calculating SARS-CoV2 titers. Was different localization of the virus seen in different areas of the brain? It might be interesting to discuss if they saw any differences and suggest this as a future direction. https://www.nature.com/arti... Figure 2 A-data points for NB-45 are difficult to see. Perhaps the data and the fits could be divided into classes instead of all in one figure. Figure 4 B, it is not made clear why the concentrations of nanobodies being used was chosen. Example NB-39 and Nb-43 is at 10 ug while the other nanobodies are administered at 20ug. It would be good to be more clear about the criteria for mice to be euthanized (such as the amount of weight needed to be lost). Some of the weight loss seems to be small (according to our standards) for euthanization. Figure 4 legend could include the amount of mice (assume 5), but this is not clear. In Figure 2, the variability of Nbs binding to Spike protein is very different (2A.) This is in contrast to the little variability noted between Nbs binding to RBD (2B.) This finding is not discussed in the paper. This may not need to be expanded upon, but I was curious why 4 days post-challenge was chosen to harvest tissues to evaluate the effect of nanobodies on virus titers (line 716 pg.28). It would be good to compare this time point to other time points. Do you have samples from surviving mice that you could look back at? In Figure 5, are the statistical values noted in Figure 4 also supposed to apply to Figure 5? Also, the significant difference between treatment groups in the same tissues with different letters is noted in figure legend 5, but it is somewhat confusing what is meant. More clarification in the figure legend would be helpful. The discussion portion did not reference all figures that were discussed. For example, the Biliverdin competition assay was mentioned, but not properly referenced (page 15, line 378). Animals only have clinical signs and cannot have symptoms as is described in (line 716). A clear distinction should be made between symptoms and clinical signs. https://jamanetwork.com/jou.... Figure 5, you could add a figure for each tissue and connect data points by mouse for each nanobody. This will help to see if specific mice have a consistency in nanobodies across tissue types. Figure 9, orientation of protein is flipped frequently (Figure 9A). Some papers may require the structure be kept the same throughout the figure. S1D, a caption stating what genes or products are being amplified (like a schematic) would be helpful. S3, states that length of antibodies ~133 nucleotides. Why did they amplify 700 nucleotides? It should be 400 nucleotides only. In SF. 5, maybe determine a better way to present Western blot data and revisit to describe why there are dots and not strong bands.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.01.526705v1#comment-6186420750,biorxivstage,2,"Thank you for reading and providing a review of our preprint! I think that open discourse is an important part of the scientific enterprise. I have provided responses to your major points below: We are unsure what new information the plots in Figures 1G and 1H provide relative to Figures 1E and 1F. It makes sense that the 2DTM SNR values plateau in the thicker lamella, as there is a larger region of undisturbed particles. However, because the 2DTM SNR is also included in Figures 1E and 1F in an untransformed and more intuitive coordinate frame, we are unsure what new interpretations come out of Figures 1G and 1H, and why this coordinate frame is necessary. Fair enough, we have had opposite comments from different people so ultimately decided to leave it in. We are trying to make what we see as clear as possible and lead into the following figures which show the data in the coordinate frame in G and H. Although Figure 3 shows that damage from FIB milling is distinct from typical radiation damage in cryoEM, the statement “This is consistent with a model in which the FIB-damaged targets have effectively lost a fraction of their structure, compared to undamaged targets, possibly due to displacement of a subset of atoms by colliding ions” currently relies solely on the use of 2DTM SNR as a measure. This could be more strongly supported by solving structures or 2D classes of LSUs from varying depths in the lamella to observe the damage. Solving these structures from the datasets and low pass filtering them to different spatial frequencies (as done in Figure 3) would be helpful to see if there are consistent changes at the molecular level that could explain the propagation of radiation damage as a result of displacement of atoms due to colliding Ga+3 ions. We thought about doing this. The trouble is that by averaging we lose the single molecule read out making it a bulk measurement which may obscure differences. This would look like a lower resolution reconstruction from particles at the edge, but we would not know whether this was because of preferential loss of high spatial frequencies or from less overall signal across all spatial frequencies. I agree that alternate methods for comparison are needed. I am open to suggestions of alternate single molecule readouts! Could we use changes in signal from a fluorophore? Figure 2A illustrates how variable 2DTM SNR values can be. Outlining potential workflows for experimental validation of this ribosome dataset and other datasets would be helpful for those wishing to benchmark cryo-FIB milling damage on their own particular system of interest. We agree, the boxplots don’t perfectly show the density of the data. This is why we performed Gaussian fits and reported the fit statistics to capture the distribution of the data. If there is insufficient data or it is skewed for some reason, the Gaussian fits will be poor. We encourage others to use this approach In the discussion section, the practical recommendation that particles more than 30 nm deep can be used for subtomogram averaging seems at odds with the earlier observation that damage can be seen up to 60 nm deep from each lamella surface. The reason why we say this is because there is a balance between total number of particles and the quality of the particles. Since the loss of information seems to be relatively evenly distributed across different spatial frequencies, and the number of particles in situ is often limiting, including these particles can contribute information to the reconstruction, we’ll just need more of them to get the same amount of signal. Excluding all damaged particles would only be an ideal strategy if there are enough undamaged particles to go to high resolution. The 2DTM approach and the estimation of radiation damage relies on the reduction in correlation between the ideal, undamaged template and SNR. Can there by any other reasons for a reduction in this correlation other than FIB milling and/or electron exposure? e.g. stacking of multiple particles in Z-direction in case of higher ice thicknesses leading to reduced detectability. This is something that we thought a lot about. Stacking multiple particles in Z does affect the detectability but it affects all particles, not just those on the edge. We also considered implantation of Ga+ ions causing distortions to the e beam, but that would not explain the relatively invariant signal loss across different spatial frequencies. The effect that we saw is consistent with the expected effect from a series of collisions causing local deviations in atomic positions, which is consistent with what has been described in the materials science literature, so this is what we said. Of course it is always possible that there are alternatives that we have not considered! Investigating the mechanism in detail will require further work, this is only the beginning. The fact that the damage makes it impossible to pick entire particles suggests that the scale of radiation damage due to Gallium ions makes the entire particle explode. Are there any instances in which you see differential damage meaning that only a part of the particle is damaged and the rest is intact? I would expect this since different parts of particle are exposed at different points along Y axis. Otherwise, it can be concluded that the damage is always of “whole” particles but there is no conclusion clearly stating this. This could be worth exploring. It would be very difficult to look at the signal from parts of the molecule in single particles. We are still limited by the low dose regime just like in single particle cryo-EM. The lack of detection does not necessarily mean the particle is completely destroyed. This goes to the difficulty in detecting particles with 2DTM. We use a 2DTM SNR threshold to identify significant detections and avoid false positives. Lack of detection in this case does not mean that the particle is completely destroyed, only that it is below the threshold where we can effectively make a call relative to noise. Closer to the surface the particles have a higher chance of being exposed to multiple rounds of collision cascades. Figure 3F: it is well established that at low scattering angles, the electron scattering factors of negatively charged atoms can be negative. Was this considered when calculating the SNR from phosphorous atoms in the phosphodiester bond? This would have been something to consider for the negatively charged oxygens in the phosphate. We only considered the phosphorous atoms in this case. I hope this answers your questions! Always happy to discuss more online or offline. This paper aims to set out a way of thinking about and approaching the question of FIB damage. I agree that it is an important area and there is much more work to be done to understand the mechanism in more detail!

We sincerely appreciate your engagement with our research and the valuable perspective you have shared. 1.	As for the first point raised, indeed, our method cannot be extended to models that include random slopes. In the new version of the manuscript, this is explicitly stated and presented as a limitation. ""Nevertheless, despite not being exhaustive, we believe that having the ability to model crossed random intercepts is a better solution compared to ignoring the variability of items."" Regarding the permutation scheme, we apologize if it was not very clear, but we now explicitly state that the permutation was performed within subjects and items. 2.	We assumed that PermFull could be considered as the gold standard, as we have no reason to doubt it. In fact, the cluster-based correction operates on the statistics, which should not depend on the specific statistical method used to generate them (it is a correction for multiple comparisons, not an NHST method). However, since there is no existing literature on this, we evaluated the performance of PermFull, which we present in the supplementary materials of the new manuscript. PermFull showed a power of .821 (that is, better than other methods to correct for multiple comparisons: uncorrected: .875; Bonferroni: .370; FDR: .486), a precision of .868 (uncorrected: .735; Bonferroni: 1; FDR: .984), a false positive rate (FPR) of .017 (uncorrected: .044; Bonferroni: 0; FDR: .001), and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of .823 (uncorrected: .772; Bonferroni: .583; FDR: .667). 3.	Even considering an estimated time of 2 ms per Linear Mixed-Effects Model (LMM) computation, even with a relatively simple LMM model, the analysis of a standard dataset (64 channels x 500 time points) with 2000 permutations would require approximately 1.5 days. This number of permutations is considered the minimum recommendation to obtain reliable estimates of alpha. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that Julia is not commonly utilized for EEG data analysis, especially when compared to more widely used tools such as Matlab. We would like to thank you once again for your constructive comments, which we believe have allowed us to improve the manuscript.

COMMENT 1 Firstly, I would like to congratulate the authors on their study. I really love the inventiveness of the experimental set up! The results are really unexpected. The finding that phosphate starvation proceeds ABA mediated drought responses is interesting on a mechanistic basis and will likely have direct implications for crop management practices. The field-to-lab experimental pipeline looks really effective and I look forward to more people taking up this approach. RESPONSE 1 Firstly, we would like to apologize for the very late reply. Thank you so much for your interest in our research and your positive evaluation. Our data presented here showed that PSR response occurs earlier than ABA response under mild drought. We used to study drought stress in artificially controlled environments, but we have always been interested in what happens in the actual field, at the molecular level. We had heard a lot about the lab-to-field concept, but we would like to take our research from the field to the lab. The first and corresponding authors have actually interviewed farmers about drought conditions around the world, collaborated with drought researchers around the world, and traveled to drought research sites to see the realities. In listening to such voices in the field, we have been warming up our thoughts about what we should do as plant molecular biologists for a long time. Each year we conduct field trials of mild drought induction by ridges in soybean in the same way as in the paper, and we hope to find many new and important mechanisms in many more years of data. We would appreciate your continued advice, comments, and guidance. COMMENT 2 I do have a couple of points that I believe the authors could discuss in more depth. In their ridge trials, the geometry of the soil may play a role. Phosphate starvation induces a lot of lateral roots close to the soil surface, to maximise phosphate capture. In the ridge set-up, lateral roots are restricted to only a single plane. Is it possible that this contributes to the PSR in ridge-grown plants? It is also possible that increased rooting depth under mild-drought treatment also reduces phosphate uptake. If the authors see a reduction in PSR gene expression after re-watering ridge plants, this may help to rule out geometric explanations. It should be noted that the pot experiments do already indicate this to some extent. RESPONSE 2 Thank you for your interesting comments. Since the beginning of the ridge system, we have always carefully examined the possibility of unintended effects, such as changes in root morphology, caused by mild drought in the ridge system. In this light, we showed that irrigation compensates for the growth reduction caused by ridges (Fig. 2) , suggesting that various factors, such as slight changes in root shape due to ridges, are not substantially affected. As you also mentioned, we also used pot tests to substantiate our conclusions, as it is sometimes difficult to perform detailed molecular physiological analyses using only ridges. We therefore have analyzed Pi and ABA levels and PSR gene expression after re-hydration from pot tests with different plant species and soil types and have obtained results that can rule out geometric explanations, which we will update soon. COMMENT3 I am also not so sure about the authors’ conclusion on why PSR is induced at mild drought but suppressed under severe drought “Under severe drought conditions, given the circumstantial evidence, our observations would support the notion that PSR induction is suppressed by a relative increase in Pi concentration due to a decrease in leaf water content (Fig. 4).” I would argue an alternative, more straight forward hypothesis, that plants simply prioritise drought stress over this level of phosphate starvation when drought is severe. Would the authors expect to see a recovery of the PSR if Pi levels dropped even lower? RESPONSE 3 Thank you for pointing this out. We have also analyzed Pi and ABA levels and PSR and ABA-responsive gene expressions in response to changes in soil moisture content to demonstrate whether this hypothesis is true and will update the data soon. Research on the link between PSR and mild drought is just getting started, so future in-depth studies may provide data to support your hypothesis.

I also enjoyed your thorough experiment designs and well-organized figures. However, I have a few comments regarding your figures and the statistical methods used in this paper. 1. Figure 3 C-D and F-J: I noticed an inconsistency in the statistical method used. In the Methods section, you mentioned that an unpaired t-test was used, but in the figure legends, you indicated that statistics were calculated using a paired t-test. Since you were comparing two independent groups, an unpaired t-test would be the correct test to employ. 2. Figure 3 D, H, and J: You indicated that a t-test was used. However, given that a t-test is a parametric test that requires data to be normally distributed, and there were a significant number of outliers in your figures, it could be better if you provided the Shapiro-Wilks normality test results to prove that your data were indeed normally distributed, or considered using non-parametric tests if your data were not normally distributed. 3. Figure 3B: In the Results section, you concluded that the innate immune response was more responsible for impaired growth of COX-2 deficient tumors, but you only compared the NK population and CD8+ T population given the information from Figure 3B. Therefore, it could be better if you refined your conclusion. 4. Figure 4F: The data were clearly right-skewed, so it could be better if you considered using non-parametric tests or provided the Shapiro-Wilks normality test results if the data were indeed normally distributed. 5. Figure 4H: It could be better if you provided the global p-value for the Cox-proportional hazard model. 6.

Some general stats-related and stylist comments I had were: 1) In Figure 5h, the significance level of the difference between the Gzmb mRNA quantity of anti-PD-1 and celecoxib was shown as ""0.05"", which should probably have been ""n.s."" since the figure legend only defined significance levels for p-values less than 0.05. In addition, the significance level was shown for anti-PD-1 and the combination treatment for Ifng and Gzmb, but not for Prf1 and Cd40 (instead the significance level for celecoxib and the combination treatment was shown). I was a little confused by this inconsistency since the main conclusion of Figure 5 was that celecoxib increases efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment, for which I thought it would be better to show the significance levels of the differences between anti-PD-1 and the combination treatment for all four anti-tumor genes (as you did in Figure 6f). 2) I was also a little confused by the visualization of Figure 5g, specifically what exact comparisons correspond to the significance levels shown. The figure legend mentioned that a two-way ANOVA was performed but I thought perhaps a one-way ANOVA would be more appropriate since it seems that only a single type of T cells for different treatments were compared with one another. The results section could also explain a bit more regarding this figure that could clear up any confusion. 3) For all the ANOVAs performed, it would be helpful to specify which post-hoc you performed. 4) Just stylistically, it would be helpful if each figure could be followed by its own figure legend to make it easier to interpret the figures.

I noted that you use a delayed saccade task such that the probe was presented either 450 to 950 ms before the saccade (with an average saccade latency of 150 ms). Using a design adapted to human non invasive behavioral measures we found (Szinte et al, eLife, 2018) two spotlights of increased performance with a similar timing (that might correspond to the CF and FF positions and the forward hypothesis) but no real FF when the probe was presented in the latest instant preceding the saccade execution (effect that might correspond to the convergence hypothesis). We speculated that remapping mechanism are orchestrated by spatial attention (Colby et al 1998) and thus takes time to develop. In this interpretation, convergent remapping reflect the response to the saccade target which is presented earlier in time. Did you analyzed your nice multi-layer results as a function of the probe onset relative to the saccade onset ? I would predict a less clear forward remapping for the shortest durations (consistent with Zirnsak et al study who had very short durations).

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.08.519701v1#comment-6183573515,biorxivstage,1,"Dear Dr. Wade, Thanks to you and the graduate students for the comments. These are really insightful, and I am so appreciative of your deep reading of our manuscript. You bring up some really valuable points, which I’ll respond to here. 1.	The discrepancy in global gonorrhea incidence was an oversight on our part – the newest statistic is 86.9 million cases (Unemo, M. et al. Gonorrhoea. Nat Rev Dis Primers 5, 1–23 (2019)). This is corrected in our peer-reviewed PLOS Pathogens manuscript. 2.	Working with primary human cells means that we sometimes see variability in results, which you can see from the range of data points for OpaD + serum at 60 min in 1A, some of which fall in the range of ~30%. We rely the internal controls of untreated OpaD+ Gc, as well as Opaless Gc, to make meaningful conclusions about the effect of serum on Gc survival. 3.	I agree the experiment should be done and would be very interesting! We didn’t have chimpanzee serum on hand at the time these experiments were conducted, but I think it would be a great follow-up. Chimpanzee C4BP binds to Gc with the PorB.1B genotype, so I would expect that chimpanzee serum likely phenocopies human C4BP in terms of suppressing Gc-induced neutrophil ROS, enhancing Gc survival from neutrophils, and limiting internalization of Gc. 4.	Your speculation is correct about 5f and I apologize for the lack of clarity. Our point with 5f is that if Gc associates with neutrophils, it is taken up regardless of serum or C4BP. This helped us build our model where C4BP is likely sterically hindering Gc neutrophil association upstream of phagocytosis, as opposed to inhibiting cellular processes related to phagocytosis, such as actin rearrangement. 5.	Yes, C4BP retains functional activity after exposure to temperatures up to 95 ˚ C and extreme pH conditions (Kask, L. et al. Structural stability and heat-induced conformational change of two complement inhibitors: C4b-binding protein and factor H. Protein Science 13, 1356–1364 (2004)). You are right that stating this would help the reader see how the data in Figure 1D are consistent with our eventual identification of C4BP. 6.	To be honest, anion exchange is the method that worked. It was actually suggested to me at a group meeting and a collaborator in chemistry lent us some columns. We were pleased to see that each elution (especially the 200 and 400 mM fractions) contained similar amounts of protein content, but had different collections of bands when resolved on a gel, suggesting that we were getting good serum protein separation (which was not the case with size exclusion; when we resolved the >100 kDa fraction on a 4-20% gel, it looked very similar to full serum). Essentially, we needed a way to narrow in on a smaller subset of serum proteins, and anion exchange chromatography allowed us to do that. 7.	A great question about the significance of this work. We don’t fully know, but I’ll say the following: a.	First, it’s important to note that despite promoting neutrophil activation, expression of CEACAM-binding Opa proteins, like OpaD, also provides significant advantages during Gc infection. Opa-CEACAM binding promotes gonococcal adherence to epithelial cells in the upper and lower genital tract and suppresses epithelial exfoliation, facilitating long-term colonization. We don’t know if C4BP would disrupt these advantageous Opa-CEACAM interactions, similarly to its interference with the disadvantageous interaction with neutrophils, like we show in the paper. b.	Suppression of neutrophil activity against Gc during infection could have two outcomes that are not mutually exclusive. It could 1) promote Gc colonization, and/or 2) limit the inflammatory damage associated with long-term complications of gonorrhea like PID, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility.

Does C4BP place among other processes that prevent killing by neutrophils? – I think the together, its complement-dependent protection of Gc – resistance to complement-mediated lysis and opsonic neutrophil phagocytosis – and the newly uncovered complement-independent function – resistance to Opa-CEACAM dependent (non-osponic) phagocytosis – suggests that it does. There is significant evidence that despite the multitude of ways that Gc resists neutrophil killing (i.e., manipulation of phagosome maturation, degradation of NETs, defenses against oxidative and non-oxidative antimicrobials), Gc is still quite susceptible to killing inside the neutrophil. Thus, the ability to resist neutrophil phagocytosis, both opsonic and non-opsonic, is critical for Gc survival.",2023-05-12T19:43:29,disqus_Kk58kEtHZL,Lacie,10.1101/2022.12.08.519701,Neisseria gonorrhoeae co-opts C4b-binding protein to enhance complement-independent survival from neutrophils,"Lacie M.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.30.534874v1#comment-6183552789,biorxivstage,1,"The following is a review compiled by graduate students participating in the Infectious Disease Journal Club, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University at Albany, SUNY, USA: This paper uses computational analyses of bacterial genomes to determine the distribution of anti-phage defense systems in actinobacterial species. The authors look at the diversity of defense systems, their enrichment in actinobacteria relative to other bacterial clades, and their genomic location. The authors suggest that some defense systems are enriched in the genomes of actinobacteria relative to other bacterial clades, while other systems are de-enriched. The authors also show that different defense systems are encoded in different regions of Streptomyces chromosomes, suggesting differential importance in phage defense. The fact that many defense systems are found more or less frequently in actinobacteria versus other bacteria, including some defense systems being completely absent from actinobacteria, highlights the fact that previous searches for defense systems have likely been biased in terms of the species used. The paper is well written, and with a few exceptions, the data are clearly presented. The analyses seem appropriate for the questions being asked. However, there is a concern that the genomes used are in some cases heavily biased towards individual species, most notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This bias could lead to erroneous conclusions about the relative abundance of some classes of defense systems in actinobacteria. Major comment The species used for Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria are not representative of the phylum in each case. For Actinobacteria, ~9% of genomes are from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For Proteobacteria, ~19% of genomes are from Escherichia coli and ~15% are from Klebsiella pneumoniae. This is especially problematic for M. tuberculosis, a species for which there is very little variation across strains. Some analyses may be influenced by these biases in the genomes used. For example, Figure 1B shows data for mycobacteria, but ~55% of the mycobacterial genomes analyzed are from M. tuberculosis. In Figure 1E, enrichment of gp29_gp30 is likely to be strongly influenced by M. tuberculosis genomes; this is a rare defense system that happens to be found in most M. tuberculosis genomes, so it likely appears a lot more enriched in actinobacteria than it really is. The same problem likely applies to other systems that appear enriched in actinobacteria. The analysis in Figure 1D will be heavily skewed by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. We recommend that the authors include only one genome per species. This will reduce potential biases. The authors should also include some text to highlight that biases in which genomes are sequenced may lead to biases in their data, since biases are inevitable based on the availability of genome sequences. Minor comments 1. In the Introduction, it would be helpful if the authors could include a few sentences to describe what is known about the defense systems that are discussed most frequently in the paper, i.e., RM, Wadjet, CRISPR-Cas and Lamassu. 2. In Figure 2, could the authors show the same species in panels A and B? This would be less confusing. 3. Can the author’s speculate a bit more on why some BGC’s cluster at the ends of chromosomes? 4. Figure 1 legends for 1C and 1E are flipped. 5. In the Conclusions section, the authors discuss the possibility of undiscovered defense systems in Actinobacteria, given that the DefenseFinder program can only detect systems that are already known. Can the authors describe how novel defense systems could be identified based on their data for actinobacteria? 6. Figure 1D is confusing and does not indicate which systems are more/less abundant. The data would be better represented in a form similar to Figure 1E. 7. Figure 2B shows some examples of defense islands. Can the authors comment on the frequency with which defense systems in actinobacteria cluster in defense islands, and how this compares with other bacterial clades? 8. In Figures 3A and 3B, it is difficult to tell which systems are being shown in each concentric ring. Perhaps the authors can point out the few defense systems that are widely conserved. 9. The colors of bars in Figure 1E should be described in the legend. 10. For Figure 3C, it would be informative to show data only for Streptomyces, and to indicate in that plot which defense systems were inferred using Pagel’s lambda to be horizontally acquired. 11. Figure 3C considers only plasmids and prophages as mobile genetic elements. Can the authors look for other types of element, e.g., transposons? 12. It would be helpful to include a list of gene families for each class of defense systems analyzed. If DarTG includes toxin-antitoxin systems that are abundant in M. tuberculosis, the authors should mention that. Suggestion for an additional analysis The authors have generated a rich dataset of defense systems in actinobacteria. They could use this dataset to look for candidates for novel defense systems using a “guilt by association” approach, i.e., look for gene families that are enriched in their proximity to known defense systems.",2023-05-12T19:14:21,disqus_y9FR6hyg5J,Joseph Wade,10.1101/2023.03.30.534874,Genomic characterization of the antiviral arsenal of Actinobacteria,"H.

I am certainly no historian of science, so perhaps there have been prior claims that this data refutes that I am unaware of. However, to me, no matter which way you look at the data, your sample suggests that males are indeed larger than females in most mammals. Instead of the approach I previously described, one could alternatively drop the species in the ""same size"" category under the justification that they have high uncertainty as to whether mean male size is larger than mean female size. After parsing your sample down, you'd still have more than 2.5 times as many mammal species in which males are larger than females on average, in cases where uncertainty is low. Of course, measuring more individuals of these species and including more species could change these results. There might be interesting phylogenetic patterns too. However, I still don't know what numbers are being looked at to draw the central conclusion. The fact that the 44% ""larger males"" category is less than 50% does not seem relevant to me in light of the points I raised about what the ""same size"" category actually includes. Therefore, the title does not seem to fit the data.

Lovelace1, Sarah Pottinger1, George Seddon-Roberts2, Emma Turley2 1 The Sainsbury Laboratory, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, UK 2 The John Innes Centre, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, UK * All authors contributed equally to the review and are listed in alphabetically based on last name Overview At the time this paper was posted to Biorxiv, it was the first to report single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of plants during infection and therefore is of great significance and interest to the microbe-plant interactions community. The authors use scRNA-seq to compare cell populations from Arabidopsis thaliana during mock or pathogen infection by the Pseusomonas syringae. Through this comparison, they identified a distinct subset of cells that are responsive to this bacterial pathogen. Through pseudotime trajectory analysis they demonstrate that cells transition from an immune state to a susceptible state. From this analysis they identified known and unknown marker genes for these two states and characterized them through promoter report lines. Using confocal imagery, they evaluated these reporter lines during infection over both time and space. Together the authors uncover the herterogenity during pathogen infection and this dataset is a great resource to the community. We all enjoyed reading and discussing the manuscript. Overall, the manuscript is well written, and the findings are novel and exciting. The bioinformatics analysis is robust and consistent with previous scRNA-seq methods. However, the methods used to obtain these cells for scRNA-seq provide limitations to their interpretations and should be addressed. Below, we include some general comments as well as some specific comments/questions for some figures that came up during our discussion. We hope the authors find these useful. General Comments The authors use the tape sandwich method to enrich mesophyll cells from mock and infected tissue; however, by removing the epidermal layers this overlooks the first line of defence in a natural P. syringae infection. This biases the scRNA-Seq results making it difficult to draw correlations with their seedling infection assays which aim to characterize immune and susceptible maker genes identified through these results. The authors misinterpret the trajectory analysis where they correlate time with pseudotime. They state that their susceptibility gene expression analysis at later infection is consistent with their pseudotime trajectory analysis; however, their scRNA-Seq analysis was only performed on one time point. As such pseudotime may be more analogous to spatial distance from the infection site. The authors performed limited spatial characterization experiments of their marker immune and susceptibility genes to support their pseudotime analysis. Lastly, a major concern of ours is the low number of cells and seemingly one biological replicate sample used to produce this data. Their data would be more robust if more biological replicate samples were used and more cells were sequenced. Specific Comments by Figure Overall maintaining consistent use of colors across figures will help especially when red is associated with immune and blue for susceptible in figure S3 but the opposite for Fig 2 Figure 2 •	Immune and susceptible labels could be added to panel A, so as to make the graphic easier to understand. •	Additionally, the clusters M1-M5 are difficult to distinguish from one another in panel A. It is not clear what the colored labels in panel B are for. •	The authors used an unsupervised trajectory analysis in which the starting point they used was other. Does the same trajectory play out if they changed the starting point to a different group of cells? Figure 3 •	The authors state “The expression of all immune markers was significantly reduced at 72 hpi when plants exhibited chlorosis and water-soaked symptoms (Figure 3C and 3D)” but there are no pictures of these symptoms in this figure. •	The authors state that LipoP1 is expressed in guard cells in the absence of infection yet no stomatal markers were used to demonstrate this in panel C. Figure 5 •	Focus on substomatal cavities, yet no use of stomatal marker genes, which might make localisation more convincing. Figure 6 •	While the top section of this figure is very helpful, we felt that the lower panel including the line graph might be confusing to a reader. Figure S1 •	Suggested that ΔhopQ was no different to the WT Pst DC3000 in terms of infectivity, but could infect both N. benthamiana and A. thaliana. Why was ΔhopQ used in downstream analysis if no N. benthamiana infection models were used? Figure S2 •	Scaling of panels A and B might be misleading, as the scale of panel A is ten-fold larger than that of panel B. •	Panel C doesn’t contain a statistic on the figure. There is a figure (without a p value) in the text, but this makes the figure harder to evaluate. •	Panels G-N contain a lot of darkness, making correlation difficult to discern. Perhaps removal of cells with a value of 0.00 would make the panels easier to read, as well as making patterns easier to identify. The authors state “that the vast majority of cells profiled in this study are similar in cell type as those profiled by others”. Based off the methods used by the authors, the majority of the cell types are mesophyll and in other methods used this would also be the same given that mesophyll cells have a larger representation in leaf tissue. However, many cell types are missing from the authors data which is difficult to see using the visualization methods provided. •	Panel D has no y-axis label. •	What function does panel E serve? With the amount going on in this figure, perhaps it could be excluded if it is unnecessary. Figure S3 •	Hard to see assigned clusters on panels A-C. Perhaps an overlay similar to Figure 2A would be advantageous. •	What does each cell in panel B represent? There seems to be too few to represent each individual cell from RNA-seq dataset. •	In panel D, perhaps GO terms should be clustered grouped based on expression in each cluster. A dot plot might also illustrate data better. Figure S4 •	This figure is quite difficult to decipher and might be more easily interpreted as a Venn diagram. Figure S5 •	Pseudotime trajectory should be labelled more clearly, with clear labelled transitions, so that cluster states can be more easily assigned. Figure S6 •	There is no second rep for FRK1. Why is this? •	The authors state that LipoP1 is expressed in guard cells in the absence of infection yet no stomatal markers were used to demonstrate this.",2023-05-11T14:02:47,disqus_EzIt2lfC5H,Amelia,10.1101/2022.10.07.511353,Single-cell profiling of complex plant responses to Pseudomonas syringae infection,"Jie Zhu, Signe Lolle, Andrea Tang, Bella Guel, Brian Kvikto, Benjamin Cole, Gitta Coaker",2023-03-06

Reviewed by Adrian Treves, PhD Professor of Environmental Studies, Founder and Director of the Carnivore Coexistence Lab, University of Wisconsin-Madison +1-608-890-1450 http://faculty.nelson.wisc.... (which includes full disclosures of potentially competing interests in the CCC.php page) Direct inquiries to atreves@wisc.edu 11 May 2023 I appreciate that Dr. Petracca and colleagues posted their manuscript to a preprint server to facilitate independent review and scientific debate. Such preprints are a healthy step in our field to improve the reliability of science. Also I acknowledge the risk posed by preprints, such as policy-makers or the public running with results or inferences before they have been approved by qualified peer scientists. I think two aspects of the preprint process guard against such undesirable outcomes: (a) peer reviews attached to the preprint as a comment should serve to caution against such precipitous use of preprints, and (b) the authors can reinforce the need for caution in subsequent revisions to the preprint, even citing their pre-reviewers. The science-policy interface in which this work lies is fraught with difficulties. Also I acknowledge these sorts of models are complex and difficult to parameterize realistically with confidence. None of my comments or criticisms below are meant to undermine the hard work put in, but rather they are meant to improve the final product, improve outcomes for wolves, and improve the policy that may result from applied research. Thanks in advance for reading my comments in that spirit. I have chosen not to cite much research below, instead calling the authors’ attentions to our website (above) where peer-reviewed substantiation of all my assertions can be found. I welcome peers’ emails to atreves@wisc.edu if anyone has trouble finding the evidence. Most of my comments relate to Tables 1 and 2 and the associated scenarios. A question about Table 1: the caption includes ""Lethal removal rate was calculated directly from state agency records."" Please provide those with annual numbers and locations (East or West) to help the reader understand the geographic and spatial context of that assertion. The annual lethal removal rate was a single point estimate of 0.04. I don’t understand why this was treated as a constant not bracketed by annual variability? Later, the authors wrote ""In scenario 1 (“Baseline”) we simulated all relevant factors, as described below, at levels observed in the data collection period (2009-2020)."" All factors include those affecting the human-caused mortality, right? There are numerous studies documenting a variable annual rate of lethal removal. There seem to me to be other issues with assuming a constant annual lethal removal rate in baseline and the scenario for increased removals below. The assumptions that seem to be made about constant annual lethal removal in the baseline or the increased removal scenarios might be summed up as ""livestock losses will never get better or worse so long as the current rate of removal is applied randomly to wolf packs and entire packs are removed."" I don’t mean to caricature the assumption, I mean to make it plainer so it can be scrutinized. 1. If lethal removal is assumed to be effective in preventing livestock loss as WDFW has implied in the past, then it seems surprising that the model would treat it as ineffective or needing constant renewal. Can this be justified scientifically and by reference to articles that have not themselves been undermined by subsequent work? I call your attention to recent reviews of the literature on lethal removal which indicates unpredictable effects of lethal removal of wolves, resulting in increases, decreases and no change in livestock losses depending on study and site and years (the latter of no effect in the majority of cases, see studies of wolf removal by Grente, Krofel, and Santiago-Ávila. 2. Is predation on livestock random? If not, how does the imposition of a random scheme affect the model (a sensitivity analysis would be useful); many studies reveal that predation on livestock is not spatially random or uniform. Rather livestock losses are sometimes highly predictable from spatial features and wolf pack demographics. Therefore, I also call your attention to risk models that are analogous to resource selection functions, which have been used to model livestock loss in our region among others (see my lab website and search for ""risk"" and ""forecast"" please). 3 . Has WDFW lethal removal eliminated entire packs and in what percentage of cases? This baseline information might be helpful in interpreting the scenarios. I discuss partial or entire pack removal further below. I was confused by the increased removals scenario and the harvest scenario. Given they are differentiated I have to assume increased removals is NOT public hunting, trapping, hounding, etc. It is unclear what conditions might lead to such an increase in lethal removals. The authors wrote ""In scenarios 4 and 5 (“Increased removals”), we simulated an increased number of lethal management removals such that 30% of the wolf population[*] would be removed every four years, corresponding to an annual removal rate of 8.5%."" Does this replace the baseline removal rate or supplement it? I didn’t see a scientific justification for the value of 30% and I don’t understand where 8.5% came from (30 /4 = 7.5%). Even if I add the baseline it does not reach 8.5%. I’m sure I’m missing something but the calculation could be clarified. Another concern about this scenario is that it uses a flat mortality rate (% of population) regardless of conditions. That seems to simulate population reduction (sometimes called culling) but applied randomly to entire packs. Given that is a highly unusual pattern of management, it would help to understand the rationale behind it. See below where other more common scenarios are NOT considered. Therefore, I do not understand the criteria applied when selecting scenarios that deserve modeling and scenarios that do not deserve modeling. ""Harvest"" See issues with terminology in the section on Minor comments below. Every 6 months: This is an unusual off-take pattern. Readers may be tempted to assume that the policy-makers among the authors or their superiors in state agencies are planning two seasons of wolf-killing per year. The authors might wish to address why such an unusual wolf-killing system was included in this paper. Also, the method that allows only adults or juveniles yet simulates twice-a-year 'harvest’ assumes the public can avoid killing pups. Is there evidence for that assumption? The assumption seems dubious on its face but regardless it requires some consideration of methods of 'harvest’ and accidental non-target killing. Additive: While this is more conservative than any compensatory scenarios, it still does not acknowledge the many sources of evidence for super-additive mortality when the public begins killing wolves: Creel, Vucetich, Chapron, or when wolf-killing is liberalized in general: Santiago-Avila, Louchouarn, Suutarinen, Liberg, Treves. There are now more than ten studies quantifying the super-additive effects on population dynamics or the undocumented losses of wolves when killing is liberalized (I.e., undocumented deaths that can be attributed to policies of liberalized killing). The OMISSION of any alternative scenario with super-additive mortality and the OMISSIOn of alternative scenarios with increases in illegal killing triggered by the harvest and increased removals scenarios are problematic. I capitalized the word OMISSION to emphasize that they are not scientific decisions but value-based decisions about which scenarios to publish and which not to publish. Value-based decisions are akin to unstated assumptions derived from personal or organizational preferences / beliefs / policies. Assumptions about parameter values or interactions between variables should be transparently stated and usually justified scientifically. Unstated assumptions in a modeling paper seem to me to be scientific missteps because the range of possible parameter values was circumscribed for reasons that are not transparent or justified by peer-reviewed research. Also, please note that an attempt to scientifically justify circumscribed parameter values might require an even-handed summary of evidence for and against the assumed constraints on parameter values. For example, the increased removal scenarios (currently unjustified) might be paired with a lowered removal scenario or a scenario that curbs ongoing mortality sources such as poaching or vehicle collisions, hypothetically. To me it seems easier to evaluate alternative scenarios even-handedly than to justify the current ones. Furthermore, my concern is that the decisions about which scenarios to publish in the current manuscript leave unanswered 'why these scenarios and not others?' And the authors do not touch upon alternative scenarios for how wolf-human coexistence might play out differently. Instead, the scenarios presented in this paper are a subset of wolf-human coexistence and that subset is slanted towards negative views of wolves (more killing). For example, there is nothing scientific telling us to simulate lethal removal at level x or y. We explored this problem in sustainable use models in Frontiers in Conservation Science in 2021. My criticism is meant to be constructive as it is not too late to adapt your models to positive wolf-human coexistence scenarios, such as those involving provisioning to improve wolf reproduction or survival, increasing wild prey bases in regions with low prey, better enforcement against unregulated, human-caused mortality, use of non-lethal methods to protect livestock etc. I understand WDFW might never undertake such actions but that does not constrain scientists seeking approximations of reality. Also, administrations change, private actors / organizations sometimes step in, and background conditions change especially for a simulation run for 50 years. I hope you see how a subset of scenarios was presented for non-scientific reasons. Please remind readers that the selection of scenarios is value-based not science-based. Moreover, the selection of parameters within scenarios may also be value-based. For example, partial pack removals — simulated in your methods when ""excess"" removals are randomly assigned to another pack short of full pack removal — is NOT suggested to be effective in any study, even Bradley et al. 2015. Moreover, can the latter study even be used to justify the effectiveness of removal of entire wolf packs? I don’t think so. Consider that Santiago-Ávila et al. 2018 showed Bradley et al. 2015 was not reproducible until and unless the methods are clarified. Also, the 2018 article identified a possible statistical bias favoring lethal removal. If the data were to be shared (another hallmark of reproducibility), the bias minimized, and the methods clarified, one might argue that full pack removal has a scientific basis. But we’re not there yet. Because I noticed omissions of scenarios and circumscribed parameter values without explicit statement of assumptions and missing literature, I offer a comment on potentially competing interests. T The scientific community has changed position on this in recent years and is increasingly recognizing the potentially distorting effects of values and ideology on scientific research. Nothing is necessarily disqualifying but all should be disclosed fully and transparently. Ideological commitments expressed through memberships in civil society and professional societies (e.g., TWS or AFWA), institutional policy positions (e.g., WDFW’s current policies), and personal affiliations or rivalries, might all place pressures on individuals that reflect competing interests. These can affect the unstated assumptions, literature reviews (what is cited and summarized versus omitted) and the methods chosen and analyses used, in addition to the traditional issues relating to financial interests. I am not referring to one or two articles being missed but a pattern of omitting peer-reviewed research in highly ranked international journals as I noted here. I emphasize the issue of potentially competing interests as a way to inspire greater public confidence in the scientific endeavor. Thanks for your kind attention. Again I admire your decision to publish preprints so that pre-publication review has an opportunity to influence the future manuscript and perhaps public policy. Minor concerns Terminology: The term ""recovery"" has a meaning in US federal and state endangered species law as you all no doubt are aware. Recovery in its legal sense may lead policy-makers to shift regulatory schemes to down- or delist wolves. Therefore it is not a value-neutral scientific term and could be viewed as prejudicial. I see passages in your text where recover(y) is appropriate but others where it was used to refer to recolonization or population growth. There I recommend instead using recolonizing or geographic spread or numerical rebound which do not imply a legal status. This seems especially relevant when scenario outcomes suggest a low likelihood of achieving legal recovery. Relatedly, I recommend careful consideration of certain jargon words that may be mainstream in wildlife management but are not commonplace in ecological sciences or policy among all publics –  and may have value-based or moral connotations, e.g., harvest and depredation. In place of harvest I suggest ""permitted, regulated wolf-killing by the public"", because harvest is a euphemism that holds implicit assumptions about the values of wolves and motivations of humans who participate. To see why not to use 'depredation’, look at the first definition in the Oxford English Dictionary. I used it for years but now see the error. Finally, the discussion of non-lethal methods might benefit from updating to include studies since 2010 on livestock-guarding dogs, and systematic reviews of effectiveness 2016-2021.",2023-05-11T13:43:40,adriantreves,ADRIAN TREVES,10.1101/2023.03.23.534018,Forecasting dynamics of a recolonizing wolf population under different management strategies,"Lisanne S.

However, traditional sample preparation of thin cell sections is laborious and can introduce artifacts. In this paper, the authors quantify the sample damage introduced by cryo-FIB milling, a newer technique proposed as an alternative to traditional sample preparation. Although much has been done to understand how radiation damage affects particles in single particle cryoEM, the same cannot be said for understanding how cryo-FIB milling damage affects samples in cryoET. As cryo-FIB milling becomes more widely used, downstream workflows and data interpretation will be helped greatly by understanding the mechanism and characteristics of damage caused by cryo-FIB milling itself. This paper aims to characterize the damage caused by cryo-FIB milling by using a model system, the ribosome. The authors utilize a previous template matching method they developed, 2DTM, as a broad metric for comparing and quantifying damage. The major success of this paper is highlighting practical considerations for sample preparation based on quantification of damage from cryo-FIB milling. The major confusion we have with this paper is in interpreting the data for the mechanism of cryo-FIB milling damage, and whether alternate explanations for the data have been explored. This paper provides helpful insight into what one can expect from cryo-FIB milling their samples, and lays the groundwork for optimizing sample preparation. Major points We are unsure what new information the plots in Figures 1G and 1H provide relative to Figures 1E and 1F. It makes sense that the 2DTM SNR values plateau in the thicker lamella, as there is a larger region of undisturbed particles. However, because the 2DTM SNR is also included in Figures 1E and 1F in an untransformed and more intuitive coordinate frame, we are unsure what new interpretations come out of Figures 1G and 1H, and why this coordinate frame is necessary. Although Figure 3 shows that damage from FIB milling is distinct from typical radiation damage in cryoEM, the statement “This is consistent with a model in which the FIB-damaged targets have effectively lost a fraction of their structure, compared to undamaged targets, possibly due to displacement of a subset of atoms by colliding ions” currently relies solely on the use of 2DTM SNR as a measure. This could be more strongly supported by solving structures or 2D classes of LSUs from varying depths in the lamella to observe the damage. Solving these structures from the datasets and low pass filtering them to different spatial frequencies (as done in Figure 3) would be helpful to see if there are consistent changes at the molecular level that could explain the propagation of radiation damage as a result of displacement of atoms due to colliding Ga+3 ions. Figure 2A illustrates how variable 2DTM SNR values can be. Outlining potential workflows for experimental validation of this ribosome dataset and other datasets would be helpful for those wishing to benchmark cryo-FIB milling damage on their own particular system of interest. In the discussion section, the practical recommendation that particles more than 30 nm deep can be used for subtomogram averaging seems at odds with the earlier observation that damage can be seen up to 60 nm deep from each lamella surface. The 2DTM approach and the estimation of radiation damage relies on the reduction in correlation between the ideal, undamaged template and SNR. Can there by any other reasons for a reduction in this correlation other than FIB milling and/or electron exposure? e.g. stacking of multiple particles in Z-direction in case of higher ice thicknesses leading to reduced detectability. The fact that the damage makes it impossible to pick entire particles suggests that the scale of radiation damage due to Gallium ions makes the entire particle explode. Are there any instances in which you see differential damage meaning that only a part of the particle is damaged and the rest is intact? I would expect this since different parts of particle are exposed at different points along Y axis. Otherwise, it can be concluded that the damage is always of “whole” particles but there is no conclusion clearly stating this. This could be worth exploring. Figure 3F: it is well established that at low scattering angles, the electron scattering factors of negatively charged atoms can be negative. Was this considered when calculating the SNR from phosphorous atoms in the phosphodiester bond? Minor points In Figures 1G and 1H, we suggest using nanometers instead of Angstroms as the x-axis label. This will make it easier to interpret the blue dotted lines as the edges of the lamella. In Figure 1, it is unclear if “relative 2DTM SNR” of Figures 1E and 1F are exactly the same as “2DTM SNR” of Figures 1G and 1H. How does the 2DTM method take into account the radiation damage in template structure? Would it be possible to recapitulate the template model based on the known mechanisms of radiation damage due to exposure to electron beam during imaging so as to use a close to ideal model for template matching? It would be helpful if the rationale for selection of undamaged, ideal templates in 2DTM is explained in more depth. For example, are these from single particle cryoEM data with the minimum possible radiation damage or are they from other experimental techniques? What does the dotted line in Fig 2D represent? Why are there more outliers (outside the lamella thickness) in 120 nm sample (fig 1G) than in the case of 200 nm lamella? What does the existence of these outliers indicate? Are particles averaged over Y-axis in fig 1G and H? What is the error in measurement of electron exposure and how is it propagated in measuring the radiation damage? -Tushar Raskar, Daphne Chen, and James Fraser",2023-05-09T22:54:47,,Daphne ,10.1101/2023.02.01.526705,Quantification of gallium cryo-FIB milling damage in biological lamella,"Bronwyn A.

We manipulated chromosome 1q in four different cell lines - A2780, AGS, A2058, and MCF10A. In A2780 and MCF10A, TP53 is wild-type and the cells have a functional p53 pathway. In AGS and A2058, p53 is either mutated or non-functional. (I know that AGS is reported to have wild-type TP53, but we pulsed these cells with a DNA damaging-drug and they didn't up-regulate p53 targets, so either this cell line has acquired a mutation in TP53 or there's some other alteration in the pathway). There's clearly a strong interaction between 1q copy number and TP53 mutation status, as 1q gains are much more common in TP53-wildtype tumors compared to TP53-mutant tumors. However, there is still a significant fraction of TP53-mutant tumors with 1q gains, so there's probably some benefit for this aneuploidy that's p53-independent. We don't yet know what it is. Regarding the role of p53 in the 1q-regain events that we observed, it's an interesting question and we haven't done the experiment. p53-mutant cells have a weaker G2 checkpoint, so they might enter mitosis with unrepaired DNA damage or replication fork problems that promote chromosome missegregation.

This sentence was recently cited in an article in the NY Times with an unfortunate and wrong headline (""Why Does Bad Science on Covid’s Origin Get Hyped?"" David Wallace-Wells, 3/May/2023): Overall, across the full database of genetic material found in the market, the presence of raccoon-dog DNA was negatively correlated with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 material: When samples had more raccoon-dog genetic material, there was actually less SARS-CoV-2 than was found in other samples. An article in Nature (Dyani Lewis 04/May/2023) reports that ""there was no such association that made sense"" and ""In fact, the strongest associations were with species, such as fish, cows and goats."" I argue that most positive and negative correlations reported in this manuscript and in the Liu et al preprint (2022) do, in fact, make sense. Liu et al reported sampling rationale (Nature 2023. Extended data tables 2 and 3). Sampling on 1/Jan was largely premised on proximity to human COVID-19 cases with disease onset in mid-to-late December 2019. Sampling on 12/Jan was for ""environmental samples from stalls that sold livestock, poultry, farmed wildlife"" an examination of maps sampled stalls shows that sampling had little relation to reported COVID-19 cases. I reproduced the visualizations in Fig 5 and colored spots based on species category in the market context (e.g. human, meat, fish, wildlife). I additionally examined correlations for data from 1/Jan only. Examining 1/Jan and 12/Jan separately shows little correlation. What is left for 1/Jan is largely expected positive correlation from correlated error on 1/Jan for species with the high abundance on a day when there are no samples negative for viral RNA. It is only when combining 1/Jan and 12/Jan data, or when combining all sampling dates, that the reported correlations are observed with all parameter combinations: positive correlations for meat and fish, and negative correlation for some wildlife species. This is an artifact of combining sampling focused on COVID-19 cases on one day, with sampling focused to a large extent on wildlife sales on subsequent days. The expectation is that later samples will be lower in viral RNA because of lack of proximity to a COVID-19 case and also sample degradation. Lastly, for 12/Jan there is correlation for species disproportionately found in stall 6-29/31/33, with no known link to a human COVID-19 case, and later sampling shows that this was a reason for concern in February/March 2020. This is the stall with samples analyzed by Crits-Cristoph et al (2023). The 182 animal samples reported linked to this stall include rabbit (85), hedgehog (65), snake (24), bamboo rat (5), other (3).

The authors clearly demonstrate that increased mitochondrial ceramide causes CoQ depletion and leads to insulin resistance. However, I believe some claims in the paper are somewhat over-interpreted, e.g. 'One possibility is that palmitate induces insulin resistance in L6 myotubes via a ceramide-independent pathway. However, this is unlikely as palmitate-induced insulin resistance was prevented by the ceramide biosynthesis inhibitor myriocin (Fig. 1A) and we observed a specific increase in C16-ceramide levels in L6 cells following incubation with palmitate, which was also prevented by myriocin'. Ceramide potently reduces membrane fluidity, so it could be that the pharmacological and genetic manipulations done in the manuscript results in altered mitochondrial membrane fluidity.

Regarding snakehead fish, I also noticed this and looked closer. Reads are very rarely mapped for that species, confidence intervals are much wider for correlation, and it's negatively correlated with PCR. This is driven by a single sample (Q37) that is from the inside of a freezer in stall 8-25. I think this is the only sample with SC2-mapped reads not from stall 6-29/31/33 on 12/Jan. Similar story for another species identified in the same sample. Amur hedgehog, European hedgehog (unsure if this is a species expected to be found here), and Malayan porcupine have the highest correlation Spearman correlation for 12/Jan with what seems like sensible parameter choices. All also rank highly for correlation with PCR, as do goat and dog. Of course I agree that the data don't point to any one species and human reads being rare in one sample does not rule us out, either. However, I don't think that this is inconsistent with either of the news articles cited in the manuscript, with both articles including a variety of opinions on the strength of this evidence. Both articles correctly report that the data points to one stall that wasn't sampled based on a reported human COVID-19 case, that stall happened to have quite a few raccoon dog reads, and investigators in early 2020 clearly noticed this as well and collected 205 additional samples focus on this stall... unfortunately waiting quite a while to start.",2023-05-03T19:45:24,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,10.1101/2023.04.25.538336,Association between SARS-CoV-2 and metagenomic content of samples from the Huanan Seafood Market,Jesse D.

Below is a review compiled by the MICR603 ""Journal club in immunology"" at the University of Tennessee Knoxville: UTK MICR603 “Journal club in immunology” review of the paper by Gül et al. “Intraluminal neutrophils limit epithelium damage by reducing pathogen assault on intestinal epithelial cells during Slamonella gut infection” Summary: The work of Gül et al. investigates the role of neutrophil recruitment and activity on epithelial cell damage during Salmonella infection. They investigate this using several techniques including several in vivo models and microscopy. The authors investigate this from different angles by utilizing germ free mice that lack a resident gut microbiota and by investigating epithelial integrity and shedding during normal and neutrophil-depleted infections. Positive feedback: The authors provide an in detail review of what is understood during Salmonella infection and what is not during the different stages of infection in several different models. This provides solid reasoning for their use of several different model systems in this paper. Additionally, they are commended for their use of not only different Salmonella strains (wild-type vs mutants) but their use of different host models and antibiotic treatments to strengthen their claims and understanding of Salmonella infection and the role of neutrophils during infection. The authors use several different controls/treatments/previous studies to further back up their results and claims seen in this paper. For example, they further confirm their neutrophil depletion results by comparing against their controls as well as previous study results with neutrophil and monocyte depletions which takes away uncertainties that their results could be due to monocyte presence in the neutrophil depleted mice. Additionally, the use of experimental diagrams/design in figures is very useful when referencing other data in the figure. The authors are also commended on their use of microscopy to back up their data quantification and their flow and organization of figure panels. Major Concerns: •	4a- Antibiotic pre-treatment can greatly influence Salmonella invasion… every other figure/model uses streptomycin model and this one is using ampicillin (inconsistency with pre-treatment). Could you compare streptomycin and ampicillin results? Can they comment on what happens with ampicillin+WT treated mice? •	Were mice being placed in clean cages after gentamicin treatment? •	Gentamicin treatment: clarify if it was just in drinking water or during cecal tissue plating. A few sentences clarifying this is needed. •	Germ free mice: they interpret these as no bacteria in the gut, but they also have weird immune systems because of this. Would it be better to pretreat WT mice with antibiotic cocktail to deplete the residential microbiota without perturbing the immune system? •	How do you know the pad4 drug is working? Some confirmation here is needed. Minor concerns: •	The authors use the abbreviation “mLN” in multiple figures and their writing without defining what this is. It may not be clear to some readers what this is referring to. •	When referencing P values in the figure captions, it would be beneficial to state the actual P value and not just >/< in order to add more impact to the statistics.  •	5e- different microscopy planes : control is a cross section and neutrophil depletion is from a top plane of view •	5d - levels spelled incorrectly •	Why use pad4 inhibitor instead of pad4 deficient mice •	Pad4 inhibitor IP injection vs oral administration – reasoning for the use of one over the other could be better described. •	Controls in Fig1 are incomplete - no uninfected group and no isotype control group •	What is the dashed line in 1B? – Some further clarification is needed •	Conclusion: limitations of study needed •	1e: instead of quantifying with a 63X field of view they could use area metrics instead (more quantifiable) •	4 - B&C y axis - connect these units to whole organ so you can compare the bacterial load in lumen vs epithelial tissue •	Mention division time of salmonella in vivo / in vitro •	Speculate mechanism of expulsion? •	Do we know that these are intact cells in imaging",2023-05-03T13:45:00,,UTK Micr603,10.1101/2023.02.23.529832,Intraluminal neutrophils limit epithelium damage by reducing pathogen assault on intestinal epithelial cells during Salmonella gut infection,"Ersin Gül, Stefan A.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.03.526907v1#comment-6175649147,biorxivstage,1,"The comment below is a review written by two undergraduates for a course project: Summary and Strengths: This manuscript by Hanly et. al. seeks to explain continuous color variation found in Colias philodice and C. eurytheme sulfur butterflies. Pterin pigments create the color variation observed across butterflies as well as other species. However, there has been limited study of pterin and genetic variation in wild butterfly populations. Male C. philodice butterflies are observed to have yellow pterin expression while C. eurytheme displays orange pterin expression. Males are also known to have variation in UV-iridescence in both species. Both female C. philodice and C. eurytheme express a white phenotype since their pterin expression is reduced. QTL mapping across F2 hybrid males revealed a candidate gene red on chromosome 18 for pterin pigmentation variation. Mosaic knockout experiments on this gene revealed a decrease in pterin content, causing males to look more similar to the female phenotype, and significant disorganization of pterin granule structures. QTL mapping also revealed a second gene interacting with red, the transcription factor bab on chromosome Z, which had been previously documented to cause an increase in UV-iridescence, especially in females. Knockout experiments for bab in females showed a visible increase in UV-iridescence when viewed from a 30-degree angle, and increased orange pigmentation on the dorsal region and a variety of effects on other areas of the wings. The interaction between these loci controls an estimated 70% of pigmentation variation. Wing size is another trait that the authors hypothesized could be controlled by the sex chromosome. PCA analysis of male butterfly wing size distinguished between the UV-iridescent males and non-UV-iridescent males. When a QTL analysis was performed, the authors found significant markers at chromosomes Z and 2. Through two-QTL analyses, they found that 18% of size variation across males could be explained by an interaction between these loci. The combined data suggest that the Z chromosome plays a key role in intraspecific variation and distinguishing traits between C. philodice and C. eurytheme. The authors did an exceptional job of connecting pertinent and creative analyses to the conclusions drawn toward the end of each subsection, as well as the overall logical flow and organization of the manuscript. In particular, their usage of QTL analyses all supported the conclusions drawn with regard to the sex-linked component of the color trait. This was significant because it set up additional experiments on this Z-chromosome, such as the male UV iridescence experiments studying the bab transcription factor. This made for a much easier read and allowed the paper to build on itself through each of its analyses. Additionally, the presentation of the automated phenotyping experiments before any other data created a much needed visual background for the subsequent molecular analyses. Understanding the phenotypic variation under scrutiny was valuable for the comprehension of what followed, so this was certainly a major strength and a clever way to present information. The described logical flow is also rooted in the paragraph structure throughout the manuscript which made the paper much more accessible to non-expert audiences. For example, most paragraphs began with a broad introductory sentence describing a rundown of what was done in the section, followed by a more in-depth description of the experimentation and interpretation of their results. It is also worth noting that many of the experiments were very creative and yielded visually appealing analyses and highly convincing results. For example, the SEM analyses conducted on the red crispant scales added a fascinating visual component of microscopic phenotypic differences that correlate on a larger scale to observed variation in scale pigmentation. Having multiple levels of visual data lends well to the conclusion that the intactness of the red gene is necessary for most (not all, however, as in Alba individuals) wild-type pigmentation in C. eurytheme and C. philodice. Overall, the combination of experimental creativity, thorough organization, and logical flow all contribute to an interesting and well-executed manuscript. Major Point: As a broad note, one of the aims could have been tied together with the others more comprehensively. Specifically, we suggest that a more thorough justification of the wing size analysis is provided. While it was included in the introduction, it jumps out in the sense that it is only marginally related to the main focus of continuous color variation. Deepening the connection would serve as a much needed transition because, in the current draft, the wing size data appear to be added onto the end rather than an integral and interconnected part of the study. Part of the reason for this is that the other aims flow so well and appear in a logical order, while this experiment is almost ancillary. The experiment and accompanying analysis are still valuable and absolutely warranted in the paper, but strengthening the justification for their inclusion would go a long way in making the transition more seamless. Minor Points: Figure 1, legend, section H-I: “Agricultural site”, we suggest that these sites are specified. Figure 1J, legend: we suggest the inclusion of a p-value on the graph or in the legend. Page 6, paragraph 3: A period is missing at the end of the last sentence. Page 8, paragraph 5: “Marginally significant interaction”, we suggest a p-value be specified. Figure 3B: We suggest a p-value be included on the graph or in the legend. Page 10, paragraph 1: “...fused with other chitinous elements”, we suggested that the fusion be expanded on, as it is unclear without background insect knowledge. Page 12, paragraph 2: “Of note”, we recommend this be deleted or the wording changed. Page 12, paragraph 3: “...pterin pigmentation in females in a complex fashion…” we suggest the deletion of “in a complex fashion.” Figure 6, A-K: We recommend the use of the alternative transformed data from the supplement (using the purple, blue and pink color scale) or the inclusion of specific color swatches sampled from the images to to highlight the extent of the color differences that are not as visible to the untrained eye. In general, the alternative transformed data was more visually striking and helped us observe the differences more readily, so perhaps these can be incorporated throughout the paper while the raw images are placed in the supplement. Figure 6D: We recommend that the wild-type and knock-out regions are better highlighted by using a thicker black line to highlight the boundaries between the two. Finding ways to increase the amount of contrast in all of the figures containing wing images would be helpful, as there are a lot of the same colors next to each other. Figure 7A: We suggest a P-value be included either on the graph or in the legend. Page 16, paragraph 1: We suggest considering a rewrite of the first three sentences in the discussion section. There are a few run-on sentences that have too much additional punctuation, making it a little difficult to connect the sentences together without having to reread. Shortening the sentences would also make them a bit punchier which is more advisable for driving home a point. Page 22, methods on butterfly mapping broods: We suggest including the reason for selection of summer conditions, as well as perhaps the inclusion of how the winter conditions may affect the observed results. Seasonal variation is mentioned several times during the manuscript as being an observable and testable phenotypically plastic trait, so this justification would be consistent with the claims that have been made in the text",2023-05-02T18:08:52,,Priscilla,10.1101/2023.02.03.526907,Genetics of continuous colour variation in a pair of sympatric sulphur butterflies,"Joseph J.

I am curious what parameter combinations were attempted and how reasonable it is to call them ""cherry picking."" Sampling on 1/Jan was biased to locations known to be linked to humans recently infected with SARS-CoV-2 and is expected to show correlation between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and nucleic acids from both humans and species sold at these locations. Sampling on 12/Jan was biased towards locations known to be linked to wildlife sales without, as far as I know, reason to expect a positive SARS-CoV-2 result by PCR or sequencing. In my hands, the only ""cherry picking"" that is required is including samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 and not including sampling from 1/Jan when it was focused on locations of human COVID-19 cases. The result is that samples with reads for ""Amur hedgehog"" and ""Malayan porcupine"" consistently rank highly with any choice of parameters otherwise. This is also true if examining correlation between species reads and positivity by PCR. It is difficult to say it's ""cherry picking"" to focus on the one day with sampling not biased to locations expected to have reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2. However, I agree with comments by Débarre and Crits-Cristoph that this type of correlation analysis is problematic. In the end, in pointing to multiple species it points to one location. That location and locations and animal carcasses linked to it were subsequently sampled hundreds of times, so clearly investigators saw correlation in this data and acted on it.",2023-05-02T16:06:52,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,10.1101/2023.04.25.538336,Association between SARS-CoV-2 and metagenomic content of samples from the Huanan Seafood Market,Jesse D.

The second figure is definitely much more informative than the first, and I agree with the general sentiment that categorical thinking is misleading when dealing with variables that are continuous in reality. That being said, the discourse on rates of sexual dimorphism in the literature is largely based on dichotomies/trichotomies, and we set out to test the commonly touted narrative of larger males being the norm in mammals (i.e., in this flawed discourse framed in terms of categories, does that narrative hold even on their own terms?). Our study is therefore seeking to estimate the rates of dimorphism in mammals, not looking for an effect of some variable on the degree of dimorphism, so effect sizes are not too relevant to our question. You are correct that the monomorphic category would include species with low dimorphism as well as high uncertainty in dimorphism. We mitigated for the effect of sample size on uncertainty by running an analysis on the relationship between sample size and confidence interval and cutting out all data with sample sizes lower than where the ‘elbow’ of the curve marked a transition from a rapid decline in confidence intervals with increasing sample size to a drastically diminished return in tighter confidence intervals with increasing sample size (see supplementary figure Fig. S1). That leaves a low degree of dimorphism and high variance in body size (in males, females, or both) as the major contributors to the monomorphic category, and we don’t see that as a problem. In our view, having high variance in body size should count towards an increased probability of being considered monomorphic, as it shifts the body size distributions of each sex into greater overlap. Breaking up that monomorphic group into those that fall just above or below zero difference in body size doesn’t make too much sense to me. As you say yourself, there is no expectation of a difference of exactly zero and that would not be a reasonable standard. One would expect for many mammals to be essentially monomorphic in body size (why wouldn’t there be monomorphic mammals?). I hear you on the significance testing and agree that it is usually an insufficient approach to draw inference from data. However, it happens to be amenable to the simple question we are asking in this paper since we are just interested in rates. Ideally, we would have raw data for each species that would allow for more nuanced analyses of the shapes of body size frequency distributions in males and females, but it was hard enough even just to obtain body mass means AND measures of variance for each sex for a large number of species. Further analyses of the data to explore degrees of dimorphism to answer other questions should definitely use more nuanced approaches. Thanks again for putting so much thought and effort into providing feedback on the paper! I will likely be in Princeton for reunions and would love to discuss further!
