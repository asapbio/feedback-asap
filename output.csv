Their data presented in this manuscript include a reduction in lifespan and a cardiac phenotype that starts in young mice and is characterized by cardiac hypertrophy that ends up in cardiac dilatation and fibrosis. The cardiac phenotype is also present in two cardiac-specific MKK6 KO models, which is consistent with an important role of MKK6 in the heart. Importantly, they present mechanistic data to propose a model in which MKK6 deficiency leads to hyperphosphorylation of MKK3-p38γ/δ and increased mTOR signaling, a well-known cause of cardiac hypertrophy. The paper is well structured, the data is clearly explained and the results are relevant in the sense that they identify a novel pathway in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. After reviewing this preprint, these are our questions and comments to the authors that we think may help to improve this manuscript. Major points: The image that is represented in Fig. 2D may not be the best to represent the size effect observed for cardiac fibrosis. Most of the mice seem to show a similar degree of fibrosis. Also these mice are 23-24 month-old, long after the first mice start to die due to cardiac dysfunction, so this specific population of Mkk6 KO mice may show some kind of resistance to develop cardiac dysfunction when compared to others that died before. If cardiac dysfunction is the cause of the death, it should be present earlier in life. Thus, measurement of cardiac fibrosis at an earlier time point would be important to sustain authors’ claims. The investigation of the two cardiac-specific KO is very relevant for the conclusions of this study. It would be important to know whether those cardiac-specific KO develop similar phenotype compared to that developed by the global KO, besides the cardiac hypertrophy already described. There is no mention of the n of animals used for the data shown in Fig. 5. For example, Fig. 1A has panels with n=2 and n=1, whereas Fig. 1B and Fig. 1C has n=4. This should be better described, and mentioned in figure legend. Minor points: Data shown on Fig.1 re MKK6 KO animals is shown at different ages. It would be beneficial for the message of the paper to clarify the progression of symptoms in these mice. For example, Fig. 1C shows phenotype at 20 months of age, but then kyphosis is shown on Fig.1D at 19 weeks of age. It could be a typo but anyway paper would improve by clarifying this aspect. Fig. 1D does not have a scale bar but taking into account that MKK6 KO animals are smaller, if images have been enlarged to show better the kyphosis, a scale bar is needed. Authors may discuss this possibility if they do not have the data available. Authors claim that MKK6 KO mice have decreased BW due to increased browning of the adipose tissue and increased energy expenditure. However, it seems they have not considered the possibility that they have a reduced food intake, which could be the case due to the ataxia present in these animals. On Fig. 2, the observed size effect on different cardiac parameters may be better visualized if authors include the baseline value 0 for each parameter measured. Scale bar units in Fig. 2D does not match with what is stated in Fig legends. After the mention of puromycin, the source of the remaining antibodies is not mentioned. Why did the authors use a global p38gamma but a MCK-driven p38delta-specific KO to study the role of these 2 kinases in the phenotype of MKK6 KO mice? We found no reasoning behind that explained in the manuscript and doing so would help the readership of this paper.",2022-02-14T13:24:42,jessicapolka,Jessica Polka,10.1101/2021.11.15.468612,MKK6 deficiency promotes cardiac dysfunction through MKK3-p38γ/δ-mTOR hyperactivation,"Rafael Romero-Becerra, Alfonso Mora, Elisa Manieri, Laura Sanz, Ivana Nikolic, Ayelén M.

You ask very good questions, for which we don't really have answers at the moment. 1. we are trying to develop a protocol to pull-down transferred RNA from acceptor cells. if successful, we can ask questions about RNA modifications, RNA status (e.g. poly-A, cap, alt. splicing etc...). 2. it is not yet known. we are working on that. . 3. again - I have no answer for you, unfortunately. we are currently focusing only on RNA transfer, but maybe in the future we will also determine the transferred proteome. 4. we have not directly tested the mRNA half-life in MCF7 cells. we assume that it would be similar for the bulk of mRNAs. 5. we currently don't have proof that the transferred RNAs is causing these gene expression changes. again - all i can say is we continue to work on this. 6.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.29.478247v1#comment-5729190798,biorxivstage,1,"peter.kirkwood@ucl.ac.uk The performance of this new multichannel electrode and decomposition procedure is impressive. However, I am concerned about the reliability of the authors’ use of cross-correlation to estimate relative strengths of recurrent (Renshaw) inhibition. Admittedly, it cannot be ruled out that the observed cross-histogram troughs arose at least in part from Renshaw inhibition, but I think that much more certainty is needed before the authors’ conclusion is accepted. Positive evidence is required. 1) The only evidence cited to support the assumption that the troughs represent Renshaw inhibition, is their “similar timing” to that reported by Bhumbra et al. (2014). However, the troughs illustrated here start at a lag of 10 – 15 ms and finish at 25 – 60 ms, whereas the one figure in Bhumbra et al. showing an effect on the firing of a motoneurone (their Fig. 6E) consists of a peristimulus histogram with a trough that occupies a single 3 ms bin starting at 3 ms after zero, which does not seem to me like similar timing. The experiments of Bhumbra et al. (2014) were performed on an in vitro spinal cord slice preparation, so perhaps it is no surprize that quantitative agreement would not be found with recordings in humans. If instead one considers the classic animal experiments or the more complicated techniques used in previous human experiments, both of these result in longer-lasting inhibition, but both of these types of study employ electrical stimuli to give simultaneous antidromic activation of many motoneurones, thus recruiting long-lasting bursts of discharges in the Renshaw cells. A better analogy might be the experiments of Kirkwood et al. (1981) on intercostal motoneurones, where the bursts of Renshaw cell discharges were shorter and comparable to those sometimes seen in the Renshaw cell responses to single motoneurone spikes (Ross et al. 1975; Van Keulen, 1981). Naturally-occurring respiratory discharges of the intercostal motoneurones then showed an inhibition lasting from about 2 ms to no more than 13 ms. Uchiyama & Windhorst (2007) used modelling to assess the effect of Renshaw inhibition on motoneurone synchronization, a similar situation to here. Relatively minor effects were apparent, including troughs under some conditions (their Fig.8). These extended generally up to no more than 20 ms from zero lag, though up to 30 ms for the case of “strong recurrent inhibition”. These effects more nearly approach the present observations, even if not extending up to 60 ms. However, one important difference between this study and the current one is that the motoneurone synchronization in Uchiyama & Windhorst (2007) resulted from a simple branched-axon model for the motoneurone inputs, with independent firing in these axons. This resulted in strong, narrow cross-correlation peaks, allowing the relatively short duration troughs on either side to be clear. In contrast, in the present study the peaks are much broader and are likely to obscure any such troughs, if present. 2) There is another important consequence of the presence of the broad peaks. Although there may be some contribution in these peaks from temporal dispersion in the peripheral nerve, there must also be a considerable degree of synchronization in the motoneurone inputs, i.e. synchronised discharges in populations of interneurons or descending axons. One cannot then assume that any inhibition represented in the observed troughs necessarily results from Renshaw cells. It could have originated from any inhibitory neurones synchronized directly or indirectly with the motoneurones, such as in a feed-forward, rather than in a feedback circuit. Indeed, the troughs might not represent inhibition at all. This is, of course, the central difficulty of any cross-correlation measurement; how to rule out the possibility of an unknown “third neurone” being the source of any observed effect. Without tight timings and well-understood time courses, such possibilities become very hard to rule out. One possible complication of this sort may be apparent in Fig. 3A, in that troughs are present for both of the two cross-histograms presented, even if somewhat stronger with R1 as the “response” than for R2. However, to my eye, both troughs appears to part of a single periodicity, with a period between 25 and 30 ms. The most obvious interpretation of this would be the presence a periodic common input to R1 and R2 in the range 33 to 40 Hz. This frequency range is particularly prominent in the coherence measurements for this subject compared to the other two subjects in Fig. 2. 3) For further discussion of troughs in motoneurone synchronization measurements, see Road et al. (2021), which also includes examples of troughs which might be more readily assigned to inhibition, because (a) the motoneurones concerned came from a preparation where independent observations showed prominent inhibition simultaneous with excitation and (b) some of the troughs were observed without accompanying peaks. 4) Minor points. First, a latency for Renshaw inhibition of 37.7 ms from Özyurt et al (2019) is cited as being consistent with the trough extending to 40 ms in Fig. 3B. However, this latency resulted mostly from peripheral nerve conduction, and so is not relevant here. Second, the terms “reciprocal” and “reciprocal inhibition” (pp. 9 and 14) should be avoided, since “reciprocal inhibition” is conventionally used to apply specifically to the Ia inhibition between the motoneurones of antagonists, not Renshaw inhibition.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.08.463658v1#comment-5727623046,biorxivstage,2,"This is our point-by-point reply to the comments by Iris Young and James Fraser (highlighted in bold). The capability of cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) to capture multiple and native-like conformations of large macromolecules is transforming structural biology. This manuscript explores intricacies of the cooling process as it relates to structural ensembles. Specifically, how do variations in starting sample conditions (water layer thickness, water/sample starting temperature) and cooling (ethane layer thickness, rate of cooling) affect the distribution of structural states captured in the resulting micrographs? Can we be confident that the results of ""time-resolved"" cryoEM experiments are representative of barriers and basins we hope to capture? By a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and cryoEM experiments, the authors guide us to an empirical understanding of these questions. To understand the relationship between cooling and structural ensembles, we must begin with the thermodynamic principles in play. Ensembles represent the many possible conformational states of a structural unit, and the occupancies of the individual states depend on the energy landscape across which they are related. At the extremes, we may imagine an ensemble cooled instantaneously to 0 K, whose component structures would not be able to traverse the energy landscape in any direction, as well as an ensemble injected with enough energy to overcome any energy barrier on the landscape (i.e. a system at thermal equilibrium), whose component structures would move freely to occupy all possible states. In the latter case we would not expect all states to be occupied by the same number of particles, however — particles with exactly enough energy to breach a particular energy barrier are equally likely to fall to either side of it, but particles at different starting points with the same starting energy have different likelihoods of escaping their local energy minima. In aggregate, this produces the Boltzmann distribution, in which the populations of different states depend entirely on their relative energies. For intermediate temperatures, it is useful to speak in shorthand of energy barriers and a system's ability to overcome them. We believe the introduction of this manuscript deserves a more complete illustration of the fundamental principles, however, and would encourage the authors to possibly even add a diagram or two to aid in this effort. It is too easy to confuse the fact that cooled structures move toward global energy minima with the idea that cooling gives them the energy needed to overcome energy barriers, which is precisely the opposite of the truth. The abstract in particular ought to be reworded to avoid this misinterpretation. As suggested by the reviewers, we added a schematic of how cooling may affect ensembles (Fig. 1a). We also improved the abstract and introduction text to make it clearer that it is the additional time spent at higher temperatures that allows for barrier crossing into lower free-energy minima. The design of the computational and wet lab experiments is carefully geared toward isolating the relevant variables and reproducing the relevant states and processes. For example, to choose the equilibration times to use in MD simulations, the authors first simulated how long it would take for samples of various thicknesses to vitrify. By and large we are satisfied with the parameters of these experiments, but we question one unsupported assumption: the authors enforced an ethane bath outer boundary held at constant temperature. This could be possible if the ethane bath remains in contact with a heat sink and the equilibration time between ethane and the heat sink is negligible compared with that between ethane and the sample, but we do not see this discussed or justified, nor is this standard practice when freezing grids, as the ethane bath is isolated from the standard liquid nitrogen heat sink after reaching the desired temperature to prevent the ethane from freezing solid. We were confused by the plot of equilibration times for ethane layers of different thicknesses, and hypothesize that the unexpected (to us) trend is a result of this boundary condition: we would have imagined a thicker ethane layer to allow quicker absorption of heat from the water layer, but the opposite is shown. Moreover, there is often a cold gas layer (see work by Rob Thorne on hyperquenching: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... and https://journals.iucr.org/m.... While this complication might be very difficult to simulate, it should be explained how it might affect the interpretation of results. Concerning the wet lab experiments mentioned in the first sentence of the reviewer’s comment, we think there was a misunderstanding: We did not perform any wet lab experiments, and what the reviewer is likely referring to (Fig. 1b, we assume) are continuum solutions of the heat equation for the described system. Upon re-reading the abstract, we realized that unclear phrasing in the abstract might have caused the misunderstanding. We have now changed the abstract accordingly. Concerning the motivation for the thickness and the heat bath coupling of the ethane bath, we would like to clarify that in our work we have used  three layers of modeling. (1) estimation of the temperature drops during plunge-freezing (solution of the heat equation), (2) calculation of the response of a macromolecular system to different cooling rates (MD simulations of ribosome complex), and, (3) several kinetic models trained against the MD simulation data and then applied to the temperature drops estimated by model layer (1). We have now expanded the respective summary of these three layers in the Discussion of our revised manuscript to avoid any misunderstanding. As pointed out by the reviewers, for the estimation of the temperature drop the temperature at the outer boundaries, which are in contact with the ethane, is indeed kept constant. In contrast to what the reviewers seem to have assumed, however, we have not  chosen to model the walls of the ethane container as close as possible to the experimental situation – which is different, as the reviewers correctly point out. The reason for this choice is that in the real experiments the ethane container is much larger than any reasonable grid size of the numerical continuum calculation would allow us to implement. To solve the heat equation, however, a boundary condition is nevertheless necessary, which raises the question to which extent the too narrow ethane bath affects the results. Because of the small water-layer width, low temperatures (< glass transition temperature) in the water layer are expected to be reached well before the temperature increase in the ethane layer reaches the walls of the ethane container and we therefore do not need to include the whole ethane container in the model. It suffices to make the ethane layer wide enough such that the temperature drop in the water layer is not affected by the ethane-layer width. The various chosen ethane layer thicknesses aim to answer this question and help to extrapolate to the real situation of essentially ‘infinite’ thickness (for which the boundary condition becomes irrelevant). In particular, to test how wide the ethane layer should be, we successively increased the width (100 nm up to 3.2 µm). As can be seen, the difference between the temperature drops for widths 1.6 µm and 3.2 µm is very small and only occurs after around 10-5 s which is much longer than the time it takes to reach the glass transition temperature (< 10-6 s). We therefore chose the temperature drops obtained for 3.2-µm width for the following analysis. This reasoning was not clear enough from the text, and we have now modified it accordingly. We also thank the reviewers for pointing us to the papers by Robert Thorne and we have now included the following into our discussion: “Above the liquid cryogen, a cold gas layer with a thickness of several mm was observed [Warkentin et al. 2006, Engstrom et al. 2021]. To what extent the cryo-EM samples are already cooled when they move through the gas layer during plunging is not clear. The slower temperature drop due to precooling by the cold gas layer, would allow biomolecules to overcome higher barriers resulting in more homogeneous ensembles.” Although it does not impact the methods or results of this paper, we are also unconvinced that the use of any vitrification bath held at a lower temperature than the commonly used ethane bath would necessarily result in faster freezing, as heat transfer is also dependent on heat capacity (hence the selection of ethane for plunge-freezing rather than liquid nitrogen!) Propane does indeed appear to have a higher heat capacity than ethane at similar cryogenic temperatures, so in the case of an ethane-propane mixture, this assumption does hold, but we would prefer the authors include this detail. We agree with this assessment, and in the interest of staying within the word limit of Nature Communications, we have decided to remove this part, which is not essential for our main conclusions. As for the results of the study, it is well-evidenced and clearly presented that conformational distributions present before plunge-freezing are reflected in vitrified samples when a standard vitrification protocol is followed, and that the rate of cooling does indeed impact the degree to which these distributions are preserved. We especially applaud the authors' careful wording around what interpretations are supported or suggested by the data, leaving open the remote possibility of other explanations — they draw very clear distinctions between observations and analyses. This is good science! Finally, we find the implications of the study meaningful. The selection of a ribosomal complex as an example particle perfectly illustrates the biologically relevant range of flexibilities and temperature-dependent conformational ensembles. This example gives us an intuitive measuring stick for other types of structures. Taken as a whole, the analyses inform future ""time-resolved"" studies using cryoEM and the design of other experiments that depend on the preservation of a conformational ensemble by rapid cooling. This is a very exciting direction of inquiry that we will continue to watch with great interest! We thank the reviewer for these kind words. Minor points: - The authors could make the introduction even more clear and accessible by specifying that liquid specimens present a challenge because their vapor pressure is incompatible with high vacuum. We have changed the corresponding sentence to: “In general, biomolecules perform their functions in solution. However, the direct study of specimens in liquid solutions using EM is impeded because the high vacuum required by EM is incompatible with the vapor pressure of liquid solutions.” - We favor the wording ""most often liquid ethane"" over ""mostly liquid ethane"" for describing the standard vitrification setup. We agree and the sentence is now changed. - Sentences such as the second to last sentence in the second paragraph of the introduction could be broken into multiple sentences or otherwise simplified to avoid confusion among the several ""which,"" ""from"" and ""and"" clauses. We have now carefully gone over the revised manuscript to avoid too long sentences and ambiguous ‘which’ etc references. - Sobolevsky’s work on TRP channels and vitrification probably deserves a mention in the intro alongside the other examples, esp. because those probe a natural temperature sensor! ( https://www.nature.com/arti..., https://www.nature.com/arti… We thank the reviewers for pointing us to this amazing work. We have added both references to the introduction: “The observation that captured conformations of a ketol-acid reductoisomerase and of temperature-sensitive TRP channels differ dramatically for different temperatures prior to cooling suggests that, in these cases, the minimal free-energy conformations depend on the temperature and that the conformations are preserved during rapid cooling24,25,26.” - Tomography can be used to resolve position in ice layer, “Apart from the water-layer thickness, the temperature drop also depends on the position within the layer with the slowest drop in the center (Fig. 1a), which is relevant, because in the time between the spreading of the sample onto the grid and the plunging, the biomolecules tend to adsorb to the air-water interface 62.” (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... The introduction already referred to this work; we have now added an additional reference at this position. - The authors could comment on whether the effects of being in different parts of the ice layer would affect RMSF values. If the effects are not too small, reconstructions from different layers could yield B-factors that could deconvolute different effects! We thank the reviewers for this nice idea and have added the following to the discussion: “Finally, we would expect cooling rates to depend on the position in the ice layer, e.g., depending on the distance to the surface of the sample layer. Reconstructions from different positions could further help to disentangle the effects.” - Are there local effects to their RMSF kinetic/thermodynamic models in the ribosome? For example, could they subdivide RNA/Protein, small/large subunit, exterior/interior sites, etc? Are there any regions that increase conformational heterogeneity upon cooling (as we have seen often in multi temperature crystallography)? Using a global RMSF metric may be leaving out interesting phenomena. This has also been a suggestion by Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, which led us to include a number of additional analyses to this effect. Please see our reply to the comment of Kresten Lindorff-Larsen for a detailed description. - Are the frames and code deposited somewhere for others to examine? We will make the structures of the ensembles before and after cooling available for download ( zenodo.org), with a link provided in the Data Availability statement. The code can be obtained from the authors upon request.",2022-02-09T14:55:30,larsvbock,Lars V. Bock,10.1101/2021.10.08.463658,Effects of cryo-EM cooling on structural ensembles,"Lars V.

The manuscript by Bock & Grubmüller describes a detailed, multi-pronged computational study of the complex and important effects of cooling during sample preparation for cryo-EM. The paper is generally easy to read, appears technically sound and provides relatively clear results that will be of interest both to theoreticians and practitioners of cryo-EM. Over the last 10 years cryo-EM has delivered increasingly high-resolution structures that in some cases now rival those of e.g. X-ray crystallography. In addition to examining the structures of macromolecules, cryo-EM may also provide more detailed insights into their energy landscapes because it in principle is a single-molecule technique that enables the visualization of the conformational distribution of molecules. These advances leave two questions that have been difficult to answer. First, to what extent does the “average” structure under cryogenic conditions reflect the ambient temperature “average” structure [realizing that the term average here is somewhat misleading, the authors will understand what is meant]. Second, to what extent does the distribution of conformations (conformational ensemble) present in the cryo-EM sample reflect the distribution at ambient temperatures [leaving aside the technical difficulties of determining structural models of these ensembles from experiments]. While the first question can to a certain extent be answered by comparing structures solved at cryo-conditions with those at ambient temperature (by crystallography), the second question lies at the heart of the utility (and large potential) for cryo-EM to study conformational ensembles. This study provides welcomed data in an area that has been lacking detailed and quantitative modelling, and where experiments are difficult. The results are promising in the sense that they support the idea that cryo-EM can to a large extent capture conformational ensembles at ambient temperatures. Importantly, the study provides a framework to think about these problems in a more quantitative manner that will hopefully spur additional experiments and analyses. Specific comments: Major p. 4: I must admit that I found the RMSF-based analysis somewhat difficult to follow in places. First, just to be sure could the authors confirm that in each case the RMSF is calculated “locally” that is using an average over the specific simulation as reference. Second, when I look at Fig. S1 it appears that there are still some changes in the RMSF curves even towards the end of the simulations that are of the same magnitude (but in the opposite direction) as those observed during cooling. Is that correct or am I looking at the figure in the wrong way? The understanding of the reviewer is correct. To calculate the rmsf values of an ensemble of structures, the structures were first aligned and then the rmsf is calculated with respect to the average structure of this ensemble. For example, the rmsf values before cooling were calculated from all 41 starting structures relative to the average of these 41 starting structures. The rmsf values after cooling were calculated from the final structures of 41 T-quench simulations with respect to their average. To clarify, we have extended the description of the rmsf calculation in the Results section: “To that aim, we extracted structures of the ribosome complex, which contain all atoms resolved in the cryo-EM structure, at intervals of 50 ns from the 3.5-µs simulation at 277.15 K (Fig. S1a). Then, we grouped the 41 structures from the time points between 0 µs and 2 µs into an ensemble, aligned the structures, and then calculated the rmsf of each atom with respect to the average structure of the ensemble.” Indeed, the RMSF distributions are still changing with simulation time and are slowly increasing towards the end, which is, we agree, opposite of the expected cooling effect. This at first sight non-intuitive behavior is discussed in section “Effects of different cooling rates on the ensemble” on page 4 of our original manuscript: “For later time intervals, the rmsf values increase with a decreasing slope (intervals 0.4–2.4μs to 1.5–3.5μs).  The observed behavior is consistent with a slight adaptation of the initial ribosome structure obtained at cryogenic temperatures to near room temperature, with subsequent room temperature fluctuations.  For the cooling simulations, we expected a decrease in rmsf values.  To observe this effect, it is crucial to start cooling from an ensemble of structures which does not show a decrease in rmsf values in the absence of cooling.  We therefore chose the ensemble of 41 structures in the 1–3μs interval (Fig. S1b, red histogram).” Unfortunately, there was a “not” missing (highlighted in red) which we believe created the confusion, understandably. It is now added. However, the reviewer's comment also prompted us to have a closer look and providing further analyses of the following issue:  Inevitably, any MD equilibration of any non-trivial biomolecular system will exhibit a slight remaining drift towards the equilibrium ensemble of the used force field, as often reflected by a slight increase of the usual rmsd with respect to the starting structure. This drift also contributes to the rmsf values. Taking an ensemble of starting structures from the 277.15-K equilibration run, which under further sampling shows an increase in rmsf, results in a positive rmsf contribution also in the T-quench simulations, which might counteract the rmsf decrease due to cooling. This effect is particularly pronounced for slower cooling  due to longer sampling. Overall, this partial cancellation can result in an underestimation of the cooling effect and, hence, the numbers we provided are actually conservative lower bounds. To also provide an upper bound for this additional rmsf contribution, we have now in the revised manuscript measured the rmsf increase in the 277.15-K simulation for different time spans. As an example, consider the T-quench simulations with a cooling time span 𝜏c of 1 ns started from the 41 structures at times between 1 and 3 µs (1000 ns, 1050 ns, …, 3000 ns). To calculate how much the rmsf increases during an additional sampling of 1 ns at 277.15 K,  we calculated the rmsf of 41 structures shifted by 1 ns (1001 ns, 1051 ns, ... , 3001 ns). We then subtracted this increase from the rmsf observed in the T-quench simulations. This procedure was repeated for all T-quench simulations and time points. The results are now shown in the newly added Fig. S8. As expected, the resulting rmsf values (red) are generally lower than the rmsf values  obtained from the T-quench simulations (black), but within the statistical uncertainty. Notably, because of the decreasing temperature in the T-quench simulations, the rmsf increase due to the additional sampling is expected to be smaller in the T-quench simulations compared to the 277.15-K simulations. Therefore, the rmsf values obtained from the subtraction (red) provide a lower limit of the expected rmsf decrease during cooling, thus now providing ‘brackets’ of upper (black curves) and lower limits (red), with the true values somewhere in between. To be on the conservative side, we used the T-quench values for all further analyses to make sure that we do not overestimate the effect of cooling. We have now added a section to the Supplementary Results (“Effect of additional sampling on rmsf during T-quench simulations”) to describe these results and added an explanatory sentence to the manuscript (p. 4): “The small rmsf increase for later time intervals does not significantly affect the results of the T-quench simulations (for details, see Supplementary Results).” Also, while I realize that it is difficult to boil down a complex ensemble to one or a few numbers that can be tracked, it would be useful with alternative ways of looking at the ensembles. Are there local differences that are not captured by RMSF? What about rotamer distributions. I will leave it up to the authors whether to explore these issues further in this paper. We agree that describing the structural ensemble by only the distribution of the rmsf values of all atoms may provide a somewhat limited perspective. Clearly, spatial or chemical information as well as information on local relaxation motions will not be seen. Motivated by the reviewer’s comment, we now provide additional, orthogonal analyses in the revised manuscript: To provide chemically resolved information, we divided the ribosome-complex atoms into subsets, one containing only RNA atoms, one comprising protein atoms, and separately calculated the rmsf distributions before and after the 128-ns T-quench simulations. Further, to provide spatially resolved information, we divided the set of atoms into five shells around the center of mass of the ribosome, where each set contains the same number of atoms. For each of these sets, we calculated rmsf distributions before and after the longest T-quench simulations with 𝜏c=128 ns (Fig. S2). Indeed, there are large differences in the absolute values of the rmsf quantiles, before and after cooling, between RNA and protein atoms with the protein atoms showing larger rmsf values (Fig. S2a). Also the atoms in the different shells around the center of the ribosome show different rmsf distributions. Mainly, as expected, the outer shells are more flexible than the inner shells. However, and perhaps more surprisingly, the rmsf reduction during cooling, i.e. the difference between the rmsf before and after cooling, is remarkably similar for all the sets of atoms (Fig. S2b). This observation suggests that the rmsf distribution of all atoms provides, to a first approximation, a valid observable to capture the narrowing of the ensemble during cooling. To also provide information on local relaxation motions, we now investigate in the revised manuscript to what extent the backbone conformations of the proteins are affected by the cooling rate. To this end, we extracted Φ and Ψ angles of the ensembles before cooling, as well as during and at the end of all the T-quench simulations. Ramachandran plots of the ensemble before cooling and at the end of the 128-ns T-quench simulation are now shown in the new Fig. S4a. Indeed, the distribution of angles narrows markedly during cooling. To quantify this effect, we calculated Shannon entropies for these distributions (Fig. S4b). The entropies decreased significantly during the T-quench simulations, which nicely quantifies  the narrowing of the protein backbone conformation distributions. Interestingly, slower cooling results in more pronounced entropy decreases, confirming the overall trend. This cooling-rate dependence suggests that some of the free-energy barriers which determine the cooling relaxation further analyzed below in the main manuscript actually involve backbone fluctuations and, likely, rearrangements. We have carried out a similar analysis for rotamer angles χ1 and χ2 of the amino acids that contain these rotamers (Fig. S4c). As was seen for the backbone dihedrals, also their distributions become narrower during cooling, and this effect is also more pronounced with slower cooling. We thank the reviewer for prompting these additional analyses which in our view provide valuable insights into the shock freezing relaxation dynamics of biomolecules. We have now added a paragraph to the Results section to discuss these results (p. 6). p. 11: In terms of future experimental studies, what kinds of tests of the models could the authors envision? For example, the authors discuss work by Chen et al (Ref 24) on differences depending on the starting conditions. Do the authors’ analytical model capture such effects? Do the authors’ results lead to specific criteria for selecting good model systems to test the effects of cooling on conformational ensembles? Our kinetic model does not capture the scenario that the relative free-energy difference between conformational states can change with the temperature. We assume that this is probably underlying the dependence of the trapped conformation on the starting conditions in the work by Chen et al. Our simulations also do not capture a situation like this, because the ensemble, from which the T-quench simulations were started, is generated only at one temperature. Therefore, such a model cannot be validated against our simulation data. In our view, a good test of this assumption would be to generate ensembles at several temperatures, check if the (Boltzmann corrected) free-energy differences between conformational states differ for different temperatures, and finally start T-quench simulations from these ensembles to see how well the ratios of the conformational states are preserved during cooling. A good test system would have relatively few states, separated by free-energy barriers that can be overcome during MD simulations. Further, the free energy of some of the states should be dominated by enthalpy while that of others should be entropic, such that a strong dependency on temperature would be seen. We think that such follow-up studies are out of the scope of the present manuscript. We have now added a paragraph to the discussion: “We hypothesize that the dependence of the trapped conformation on the temperature prior to cooling observed in some cryo-EM experiments24,25,26 might be due to temperature dependent free-energy differences between conformational states. Although our MD simulations fully capture how free energies change with temperature and even the associated non-equilibrium effects, we here started all simulations from an ensemble at one (ambient) temperature, such that this effect cannot be explored. For this reason, we have also not included temperature dependent free-energy differences between conformational states within our simple kinetic models. One might test this hypothesis by generating ensembles at several temperatures, then starting T-quench simulations from these ensembles, and quantifying the occupancy of conformational states  during cooling.” p. 11/12: Maybe the authors could also briefly discuss the relationship to other techniques that rely on (rapid) cooling including ssNMR and EPR. I realize that the cooling process is different, but it might still be worth speculating on how the approaches and models the authors present could be extended to other situations. In this context I’d also like to point out relevant work from Rob Tycko studying protein folding by ssNMR with rapid injection into a cold isopentane bath ( https://dx.doi.org/10.1021%.... Good idea! As suggested, we have now added the following sentence and references to the introduction: “Rapid cooling, with the freeze-quench method27, is also used in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy experiments to trap intermediate states28 and in combination with solid-state NMR experiments allows the identification of transient folding intermediates29.” We did not expand too much on this subject, because the main focus of our study is clearly on the interpretation of cryo-EM data. Minor p. 1/2: In the discussion of molecules settling into the lowest free energy minima at slow cooling rates, it might be worth making it clear that these minima may well be different from the minima at ambient temperatures. We fully agree, and have now changed the sentence in the introduction discussing the work of Chen et al., to make clear that the minima can depend on the temperature. We also added a reference to Singh et al. Nat Struc Mol Biol 2019 (as suggested by Iris Young and James Fraser): “The observation that captured conformations of a ketol-acid reductoisomerase and of temperature-sensitive TRP channels differ dramatically for different temperatures prior to cooling suggests that, in these cases, the minimal free-energy conformations depend on the temperature and that the conformations are preserved during rapid cooling24,25,26.” p. 4: In the T-quenching MD simulations I couldn’t easily find whether the simulations were performed using pressure control and if so how. Thanks for pointing out the missing information; we have now added a sentence to the Methods Section: “The pressure was coupled to a Parrinello-Rahman barostat88 (τp= 1 ps). p. 6: “the atoms are subjected to harmonic potentials with a force constant c which are uniformly distributed in an interval from −d to d” makes it sound like it is the force constants that are between -d and d. Consider rephrasing. We have changed the sentence to ”In this model, the atoms are subjected to harmonic potentials with a force constant c. The minima of the potentials are uniformly distributed in an interval from −d to d (Fig. 3).” p. 6 “Model3 is a combination of model2 and model3,” should be, I guess, “Model3 is a combination of model1 and model2,” Yes, that was indeed a typo and is now corrected. Thanks! p. 6: It is not clear what value of the pre-exponential factor that the authors use. I did not go through the maths, but I would assume that the choice would affect the “effective” barrier heights e.g. in Fig. 4. It would be useful if the authors would clarify this, given that there has/is some discussion about what pre-exponential factors are relevant for conformational changes in biomolecules. We used a temperature-dependent pre-exponential factor 𝜅(T/Th)𝜈, where T is the current temperature and Th is the temperature prior to cooling. For the temperature exponent 𝜈, we tested values 0.5, 1, and 2. The choice of 𝜈 did not affect how well the kinetic models agree with the MD simulation data (Figure 3e) and we used 1 for the further analysis. As assumed by the reviewer the choice of the scaling factor 𝜅 indeed affects the barrier height. Therefore, for model3, we tested values of 𝜅 between 0.01 ns-1 and 10 ns-1, obtained the model parameters with Metropolis sampling and calculated the deviation between rmsf values obtained from the MD simulations and the rmsf values obtained from the model (we have now added Supplementary Fig. S9). The deviation decreases with increasing 𝜅 values and stays constant when 1 ns-1 is reached, suggesting that 𝜅 ≥ 1 ns-1. Since larger values of 𝜅 result in larger barrier heights, our results using a 𝜅 value of 1 ns-1 provide a lower limit of the barrier height. We have now added these results to the Supplementary Information (section “Pre-exponential factor for model2 and model3”). p. 11: The authors write “Biomolecules can thermodynamically access more conformations at room temperature than at the cryogenic temperature”. While that is probably mostly true, examples such as cold-denaturation suggest it isn’t universally true. We agree that this statement, as written, is not universally true, as cold denaturation shows. However, we are not aware of any case where cold denaturation has compromised cryo-EM structure determination, presumably because upon plunge-freezing the glass-transition temperature is reached on timescales shorter than those typically expected for unfolding, as our calculations also have shown. We note that any potential or partial cooling-induced unfolding events would also show up in our simulations. We have rephrased the respective sentence on p. 11 to make this issue clearer. “Generally, biomolecules thermodynamically access more conformations at room temperature than at the cryogenic temperature and rates of conformational changes are determined by free-energy barriers and temperatures22. For very rapid cooling, low temperatures that prevent barrier crossing are quickly reached and the conformations prior to cooling are expected to be kinetically trapped. In contrast, during very slow cooling, most barriers are expected to be overcome and low free-energy conformations are predominately occupied resulting in an ensemble that is more homogeneous than the room-temperature ensemble prior to cooling. However, to what extent the rapid cooling perturbs the ensembles is currently unknown.“ Further down in the discussion (p. 12), we have added a paragraph with a reference to Dias et al. Cryobiology 2010 (reference 766): “We note that during cold denaturation a transient increase of the accessible number of conformations can occur during cooling76, which, however, is not relevant to cryo-EM studies, because during plunge-freezing the biomolecule typically reaches the glass-transition temperature on timescales much shorter than those expected for unfolding. In our simulations, we have not observed unfolding events either, which provides additional support for this notion.”",2022-02-09T14:47:40,larsvbock,Lars V.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.02.454840v1#comment-5726769839,biorxivstage,0,"The application of new machine learning techniques to the protein structure prediction problem has produced revolutionary results in recent years, culminating in the AlphaFold2 performance at the most recent CASP competition. These approaches often leverage deep multiple sequence alignments, which may limit their applicability to sequences without many (sequenced) homologs and to designed proteins. The most important aspect of this paper is that it is determined to take distinct approaches to AlphaFold to the problem,  differentiating on speed and (lack of) reliance on multiple sequence alignments. While the compute efficiency is not likely a major breakthrough in the applications that are the major focus of this paper (protein structure prediction of relatively small proteins), the embedding of this approach within a protein design cycle could make it multiplicatively important (and additional speculation to that end would be warranted in the discussion). Given the sophisticated nature of all of these approaches, RGN2 stands out as something that can help unpack what drives the “black box” to work well and it could have an invigorating effect on the field to see how a wider range of model ablations tease out the contribution of different parts of RGN2. The contributions to geometric representation are likely to have an impact in other approaches as well. Overall this paper nicely synthesizes several innovations (Language Models, Geometric Representations, etc) in a fast moving discipline and includes an important new benchmark set of “orphan” proteins. Major Points: The experiments in this manuscript detail proteins with no homologous sequences. It would be interesting to see a more granular tradeoff between single sequence structure predictors and MSA-based structure predictors for varying MSA depths. See https://proceedings.mlr.pre... Figure 2-Right as an example plot that could be adapted for the task in this study. It is possible that many methods perform well without MSAs for many targets. Minor Points: Do RF/AF2 perform better when there is structural (even in absence of sequence) similarity to a known protein or are the orphans/designed proteins topologically distinct enough to make this question silly? How are disulfides handled, especially in the context of cyclic peptides? Lines 68-70 allude to single sequence structure prediction being useful for function. I find it unlikely that structure predictor outputs would be useful for functional/fitness prediction. Could the authors find any indication that their models can perform fitness prediction on DMS datasets organized by DeepSequence, Envision, or FLIP [1,2,3]? [1] https://www.nature.com/arti... [2] https://www.cell.com/cell-s... [3] https://www.biorxiv.org/con... How well calibrated is RGN2? Are there probability outputs that are reliable estimators of the model’s confidence? Did the authors use the entirety of UniParc as-is or perform some type of downsampling based on sequence identity clusters? In general, rebalancing the train dataset sequences based on 50%/80%/90% sequence identity clusters could enable a more versatile representation useful for structural and functional prediction tasks. Lines 147-149: The ProtTrans https://www.biorxiv.org/con... model uses a span masking objective derived from T5 in NLP https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.... which is essentially very similar to what the authors use.

We followed the iter with the peer-reviewed journal and I am happy to say that the paper has now been published. We believe your comments really helped us in making a better paper and reaching this goal. We reply below to each of your points. Compatibly with the decision of turning the full-length article into a report you will see many of them integrated in the published version. - While covA is extensively explained in the Methods, it has too brief of a description in the beginning of the Results section, given its importance to the associated conclusions. I would dedicate a few more sentences to explaining the reasoning behind covA, before assuming that the reader will automatically know what one means as they continue reading the results. I was a bit confused at first as to what covA was exactly measuring, and I think it's a smart way of measuring ancestral contributions to traits, so a bit more motivation for its use would be useful. Thank you for your suggestion, we now introduced a paragraph at the beginning of results giving covA definition, formula and a simple interpretation of it, in order to guide the reader in the following sections. - I think it might be good to move the text describing the connection between covA and f-statistics to the Methods section, for people familiar with f-statistics to motivate its use this way. I also wouldn't say that ""covA(i,j) has no interpretation in terms of branch length because of the fictitious nature of pA, an allele frequency which only serves as balanced comparison for the ancestries under analysis"". After all, the ""populations"" used in f-statistics analysis are also artificial groupings of individuals that share more or less history, depending on the analysis at hand. We now moved all supplementary text, including this description, in the Methods section. In addition, we agree with your point and we reworded the sentence “ … which only include allele frequencies in actual populations, covA(i,j) has no interpretation …” into “ … which include allele frequencies in groups that portray actual populations, covA(i,j) includes p_A, an average allele frequency which only serves as balanced comparison for the ancestries under analysis.” - It might be useful to try to separate the Eastern Hunter-Gatherer and Caucasus Hunter-Gatherer into 2 ancestral candidate groups, rather than treating Yamnaya as an ancestral source. EHG, CHG and WHG have quite differentiated component ancestries, so this might help solve some of the correlation issues mentioned at the bottom of page 3? See, e.g. Lazaridis et al. 2017. Although we in principle agree with your comment, we preferred to keep Yamnaya as a source to avoid ancestral groups with lower sample size, as the number of aDNA samples attributed to CHG and EHG were way less at the time of the analysis. We considered adding a separate analysis using them in place of Yamnaya to strengthen the results obtained with our original settings but as the correlation between Yamnaya  and WHG were inconspicuous in our main results (Fig 2), plus having to cope with space issues, we eventually left the analysis for future works. - The study would greatly benefit from examining the behavior of the covA statistic using simulations of a phenotype (say, in SLiM, see, for example, the recent preprints by Yair and Coop (2021) and Carlson et al. (2021)). The authors mention the interdependence inherent to the fact that the same reference populations are used, and I am concerned about what other factors might contribute to the behavior of the statistic, including, for example: 1) varying levels of negative selection operating on a trait, 2) the bias inherent to the fact that some ancestral populations might be closer to the present-day population on which the trait was measured, 3) effective size of the ancestral contributing population under study, 4) heterogeneity of the average ""reference"" populations used as baselines for comparison and 5) sample sizes of the ancestral populations (e.g. low sample size for the Siberians). We agree on this. Yet, as other reviewers did not raise this issue and the editors requested greater conciseness rather than more results, we limited ourselves to better underline the small simulation we performed at the beginning of the results section (previously covered only in Supplementary Information). We acknowledge that this does not answer most (if any) of the points you listed, but we hope this can be covered in a follow up analysis to extend the applicability of covA. In addition, we are reassured in the interpretation of our results by covA solidity in our simple simulation together with the high support of the discovered signals in the literature. - The authors say that ""those counties for which the covA distribution is significantly different than the rest of Estonia (two-tailed Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, p ≤0.001)."" It seems like a large number of counties have an asterik. I wonder if *all* counties would have an asterisk if one had chosen a more standard p-value cutoff? Why was this cutoff chosen? What would be the null sampling distribution here for what one would call significant? That each county would have the same distribution of this statistic as the whole country? Yes, the hypothesis tested is that the distribution of each county is the same as the rest of Estonia, assuming that the latter is comparable to the distribution of the whole country. We don’t believe that such a hypothesis is representative of reality, but is just a way of measuring local deviations in covA. The choice of 0.001 as significance cutoff was a rough way to take into account multiple testing, which never got a proper description, so we changed it to a standard Bonferroni-corrected p value cutoff computed for 15 counties and 4 ancestries (8.33*10^-4). Given the little difference, we confirm significance status for all tests. - Following up on this, it seems a bit strange to say that one intends to control the pleiotropies that exist between traits by avoiding overly stringent multiple testing corrections as Bonferroni. Without an alternative way to control for multiple testing (e.g. FDR, or looking at genetic correlations between traits), I don't think the best course of action is to err on the side of anti-caution and go with a vanilla P-value cutoff designed for single tests. What does ""significance"" in this context tell one about the importance of different ancestral contributions? Indeed we are using a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR approach to give significance, we now specify it better throughout the text and in the discussion section that was mentioning this problem. This, although not solving the issue of assessing significance for pleiotropic traits, is a widely used method where redundancy/non independence of tests represents a problem (e.g. testing Gene Ontology nested categories) - I commend the authors for adding a city/countryside residency covariate in their model, to control for socio-economic effects. I wouldn't suggest, however, that this covariate allows one to entirely control for other socio-economic effects (for example, socioeconomic or cultural effects that might not be well explained by place of residence). This is a very hard problem and the subject of extensive research (see for example Mostafavi et al. 2020). Maybe add some cautionary statements along these lines? Thank you for understanding our effort in accounting for such complex confounders. We agree and while discussing genome-wide covA associations not replicated in candidate regions, we added that their significance “...might indicate an incomplete correction of non-genetic factors in the genome-wide analysis. Indeed, it is possible that place of residence and educational attainment alone cannot fully account for confounding environmental effects such as socioeconomic status.”",2022-02-08T17:23:53,,Davide Marnetto,10.1101/2021.08.03.454888,Ancestral contributions to contemporary European complex traits,"Davide Marnetto, Vasili Pankratov, Mayukh Mondal, Francesco Montinaro, Katri Pärna, Leonardo Vallini, Ludovica Molinaro, Lehti Saag, Liisa Loog, Sara Montagnese, Rodolfo Costa, Mait Metspalu, Anders Eriksson, Luca Pagani",2021-08-04

Below you can find our answers to the points made in the review Comments We suggest moving part of the model validation section of the results, shown in Figures 8 (and 9), to the start of the manuscript. This rearrangement would show the reader that the mathematical model used in the in silico simulations can accurately reproduce experimental data, before the parameter-dependent changes to NPQ and ՓPSII are simulated. In the current arrangement, the reader needs to have prior knowledge that the changes in NPQ and ՓPSII shown in the simulations are accurate, before the herein updated model has been validated. Answer : This is a good point! We changed the order of the section accordingly. - Fig8. Regarding the validation of the mathematical model by comparing to experimental PAM measurements with different SP durations, or different delays of AL onset from Fm measurement, with the simulated data: what is the rationale for choosing these, how about testing the other parameters such as AL intensity and frequency of SP? Please comment on the impact of the different parameters on e.g. the NPQ measurement and rank them by stronger to lower effect based on your simulations and experiments. Also a historical perspective/physiological relevance of delaying the SP from actinic onset would be welcome! How about giving recommendation to researchers in the field to have Fm determination/SP right at onset of illumination, with no delay, to prevent further confusion (and similarly have the final SP in AL on, followed by AL off with no delay). Answer: We started the project as simulation study and then decided which experiments to perform for underlining our point. We chose the SP durations, or different delays of AL onset from Fm measurement according to two points. 1. We wanted to include a parameter that showed an effect in our simulations and one that didn’t. 2. We also talked with our collaborators, which of the parameters would be easily measured with  their equipment. To rank the parameters by stronger to lower effect based on our simulations and experiments is a good idea! However, which parameter has the biggest impact is research question depended. A final answer can thus not be given. What we can say is that the delay before and after switching on and off the actinic light has the biggest impact in our simulations. It is necessary to give recommendation for future use of PAM devices. However, in this manuscript we decided not to give them, because this needs a previous discussion with multiple researcher working in many fields ( a consortium) - Line 326. Regarding the use of another model of photosynthesis, we found this very interesting and suggest that a comparison of the simulations generated by the two mathematical models using the same set of parameters be included as a main or supplemental figure, and its description be included in the results section. The GitLab link (line 330) doesn’t specify which exact file to look at. Answer: This is a good point! We will create a figure. We will provide a more specific path to the file in the GitLab. - Line 127. “We have used 500 µmol s−1 m−2 as the default light intensity of AL.” For simulations, an intensity of 500 µmol m−2 s−1 was used, but for experiments (line 152) “The intensity of red AL was set at approx. 457 µmol m−2 s−1”. We understand that matching the actinic light during the experiment to 500 µmol m−2s−1 cannot be possible, alternatively we suggest that the simulations be carried out at 457 µmol m−2 s−1 for sake of consistency. Importantly, is 457 µmol m−2 s−1 the value given by the manufacturer for the chosen setting, and did you measure it to confirm its value? (depending on instrument calibration, usage and age, the light output can be different than set) Answer: Thank you for this suggestion we changed the default value in the simulation from 500 to 457  µmol m−2 s−1. We asked our collaborators to check the light intensity. - Line 204, 205. “The calculated steady-state NPQ values are higher for SP intensities below 3000 µmol s−1 m−2”, according to Fig.5, it seems that the threshold is rather 2000, than 3000 (or 4000). Answer: Thank you for your comment we will discuss the exact value again. Our first impression was that it could be actually a little bit lower than the value given in the manuscript. - Fig7. To test the “actinic effect” of SP duration, we would suggest to perform a simulation with AL=100 µmol m−2 s−1 AL and/or AL=0 to check whether SP themselves can induce NPQ. According to Fig8A (experimental), it seems that at 0.8s, NPQ is indeed slightly higher than with shorter SP duration. Answer: We did the simulation and included it in our simulation files. In fact, the simulation showed that only a rather small amount of NPQ is generated with AL=0. - Line 370, a necessary addition would be to list here, or write a template of, what you suggest for minimum information is needed as standard for the community. It could be similar to Table 2, and needs to include duration of AL on, off and AL quality. Answer: Thank you for this suggestion. We discussed about giving a list of standard information. We believe that something like this will be necessary in the future. However, to assemble a useful and complete list a previous broad discussion must be held including experimental and theoretical plant physiologist, working in a broad range of fields. All those fields using PAM can have different views on what is important. Because we are just a small group of scientists, we would not like to create such a list as part of the manuscript.

We suggest moving this block of text to the discussion section. - Line 264. “AL is another important information” should be “AL is another important piece of information” Answer: Thank you for these comments we will implement them -Fig. 8B and 8D. As the simulated curves seem to all overlap, and often in this study we look for fine nuances between data, we think it would be beneficial to read the simulated curve superimposed on top of the experimental data allowing a fair comparison and analysis between the two types of data. Displaying the same graphs at a larger scale would help to read them. To help in this, we propose Figure 8 to be divided in two figures, since Fig. 8A-D is related to “SP experiment” while Fig. 8E-H is related to the “delay experiment”. This would allow the size of the panels to be increased to help the reader interpret the data. Answer: Thank you for your suggestion. We will try different setups. -Fig. 8F and 8H. Plot titles “Delay NPQ/ՓPSII Sim lation”, should be “Delay NPQ/ՓPSII Simulation” - Fig. 9 seems to be redundant as the reader should be able to observe the difference between the two independent experiments by comparing Figure 8A and 8E. We therefore suggest that Fig. 9 be removed. - Line 286. “Measurements are” should be “measurements have been” - Line 289-303. We suggest moving this block of text to the introduction section - Line 324. Replace “many” by “all”! - Line 351. “Agreements” should be “agreement” - Line 361-372. We feel that the points made in this block of text have already been made earlier in the manuscript and repeated several times. Therefore this block of text can probably be omitted as it is redundant. Answer: Thank you for the comments we will try to make improvements -General comments concerning the figures: we suggest adding dark/light bars to the top of most plots in Figures 3B-C, 4B-C, 6A-D, 7A-B, 8A-H; as it would improve the readability/interpretation of the plotted data. Fig. 2-8, figure identifier letters are presented in a different font style than the rest of the text, throughout the document. While we recognize them to be hyperlinks, we think font style should be uniform. Answer: Thank you for pointing this out. We will add light bar where applicable and change the font style of identifiers. blockquote { margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm; background: transparent }p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 115%; background: transparent }a:link { color: #000080; so-language: zxx; text-decoration: underline }",2022-02-04T12:11:30,,Tim Nies,10.1101/2021.05.12.443801,Chlorophyll fluorescence: How the quality of information about PAM instrument parameters may affect our research,"Tim Nies, Yuxi Niu, Oliver Ebenhöh, Shizue Matsubara, Anna Matuszyńska",2021-05-13

However, i remain critical on how you can be sure that the nematodes were in suspended form for thousand of years on end or rule out contamination. It is clear that permafrost can be a dynamic environment so not all material sampled from a particular place needs to derive from the time (e.g., mixing is possible). Also, even carbon dating - how can you be sure that the nematode alive in more recent times (or various instances) did not integrate ""old"" carbon through food sources or otherwise. I would argue that extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence. Note that i would find it highly interesting if it could be proven and also have nothing against the hypothesis of long-term presence in suspended form over geological timescales itself.",2022-02-04T10:19:48,disqus_4b0mTOzNeU,Kenneth De Baets,10.1101/2022.01.28.478251,Nematodes can survive in a suspended form of life for indefinite time,"Anastasia Shatilovich, Vamshidhar R.

It is nice to see when the original intent (public reviews) of BiorXiv is met. We acquired our FRAP data with an acquisition interval of 1 second with a frame size 512 x 512 squared pixels. This was done after several rigorous standardization sessions to comparatively measure all 19 different protein LLPS systems under identical FRAP instrumental parameters. During our standardization runs, we had tried with more frequent acquisition intervals (frame rates) and also in continuous mode—both leading to substantial passive bleaching for our LLPS systems—rendering our measurements very difficult to analyze. You are right that for a satisfactory single-exponential fit, more data-points between 0 and 100% recovery (especially near the 50% recovery region) are required. We would like to emphasize that indeed, we do have several points between 0 and 100% recovery (and also in the region around 50% recovery) for all of our samples. Important to note that in our figures (Figure 2b and 3b), we have plotted the FRAP recovery for 19 protein LLPS systems in a single panel. We did not show all the data points in our figure panel simply for the sake of visual clarity. In the figure panels of our manuscript, we have shown data-points for every 4 seconds while the raw data were acquired every 1 second. The t1/2 were calculated from fitting the raw data with a single-exponential model and therefore takes into account all the data points near the 50% recovery region (taken with 1 second interval). Only for α-Syn LLPS, we have only one data point around 80% recovery after which the system recovers fully. By fitting this data with a standard single-exponential model, we have obtained a t1/2, which is very close to the reported value of t1/2 for α-Syn LLPS that we have previously published; where we do have several data-points near the 50% recovery zone. However, after your comments, we will surely perform FRAP of α-Syn droplets with a more frequent acquisition interval. We would like to thank you for pointing this out. Please also note that we have not calculated the t1/2 values in Figure 5g.

As part of our review of pre-prints, we compile comments from our discussion that we think may better your publication. Overall, our group found the manuscript to be a very interesting read with detailed information on the structure/function of SteD emerging. We can tell that considerable thought that went into each experiment as well as figure production. Your lab has shown an exceptional amount of rigor in your experimental designs that made it difficult to refute your findings. This study was very well done, and we all enjoyed discussing it. Below we point out some comments and aspects that we feel could improve on the manuscript. 1)	We felt that the text was a little difficult to follow. Though it is probable that this will be alleviated once the paper has been properly formatted, as the figures help a great deal in understanding the text. 2)	We very much appreciated the short anecdotes in the manuscript explaining the specific actions of the chemicals used for your experiments. None in our journal club work this closely with transport systems and it made understanding your work much easier. 3)	We were curious about your justification for using a melanoma cell line in your studies rather than an APC line like BMDMs? We’ve noticed that it has been used for other Salmonella studies, but we think it necessary that you justify in the text why you use this cell line. 4)	The order of your figures is a little confusing, specifically figures 1-3. We think it would really help if you were to either combine Figures 1 and 3 in some manner or reorder them so that Figure 3 comes just after Figure 1, rather than being interrupted by Figure 2. This would streamline the reading and comprehension of your data greatly. 5)	On the topic of Figure 3, we were curious as to why you found the specificities you did and yet continued to use the region 13 mutation rather than the S68A G69A mutations in your experiments for Figure 4. Especially given the problems you had with region 13 mutation expression and release from Salmonella. 6)	Our group wanted to extend our compliments to your inclusion of the protein diagrams you had throughout your paper. The visualization made it easy to understand the mutations made and really helped with the overall comprehension of the paper and the experiments you were completing. On this note, however, we don’t think it necessary to highlight the F and Y residues in Figure 7. They are discussed in the text but are not tested in the figure. That depiction would be better included in a supplemental figure showing the experimental results from those mutations. 7)	Lastly, we believe Figure 5C should be moved to supplementary since it only confirms that your siRNA worked as intended.

Overall, we enjoyed this manuscript discussing the multi-kingdom interactions of bacteria, fungi and amoebae, and their implications for the evolution of pathogenicity and endosymbiosis in natural environments. We thought the impact of the bacterial endosymbiosis on the fungal interactions with other eukaryotes was very cool, the experiments were well controlled, and the phenomenon was well documented. Major comments and suggestions: The claims made in the title are considerably broader than what was shown in the data, specifically the idea that the amoebae are ""drivers"" of both endosymbiosis and pathogenicity. While the impacts of the endosymbiosis on Dicty are very nicely shown, an important part that is missing is: what are the impacts of Dicty on the fungi/bacteria, either alone or during symbiosis? How do amoebae alter their endosymbiosis or pathogenicity? There is no demonstrated selection by the amoebae on either of these traits, both of which are important pieces to make this ""driver"" claim. Relatedly, given that the endosymbiosis generally increases fungal spore resistance to multiple environmental stressors (Fig. 6C), it could easily be that abiotic stressors are 'driving' some of these phenotypes in natural microbial populations. Possible ways to improve this gap include: - mixing different ratios of symbiotic and aposymbiotic fungi and placing these under an amoeba predation regime. Do the symbiotic fungi end up with a larger population size? In the mixed cultures, are aposymbiotic fungi preferentially eaten? - An experimental evolution study in which aposymbiotic fungi are incubated with extracellular symbionts +/- amoeba predation. Does amoeba predation select for re-initiation of the symbiosis? - Adding selective pressures from a couple of different amoeba species in this experiment, as it might vary considerably across amoebae - Rephrasing the title to remove the evolutionary 'driver' framing. Minor comments: - The figure labeling and figure legends could be clarified in Figures 3, 4, and 8, - In Fig. 4F, why was such a small percentage of the R. pickettii conditioned medium added? You showed earlier in this figure that it takes a relatively large % of conditioned medium to see an effect. - In Fig. 6E-H, given that the cell wall composition looks different by TEM in D, we recommend performing these staining experiments in parallel in symbiotic and aposymbiotic strains to get a hint of how the cell wall has changed. - Fig 8 B seems to show similar data (but with less information) than Fig 8A. Can you include 8A only, with an 8A-like graph for the swollen spores as well (currently 8C)?",2022-01-27T16:41:35,teralevin,Tera Levin,10.1101/584607,Environmental interactions with amoebae as drivers of bacterial-fungal endosymbiosis and pathogenicity,"Herbert Itabangi, Poppy C.

I am not going to respond to everything right now, but I want you to know that this feedback has been seen and will be included when we make our next round of revisions. We are currently working on another iteration of this analysis that tries to answer a specific clinical question. We have metagenomes from a large cohort of pregnant people that have high exposure to three antibiotics of different drug classes.  For one of the conditions in our cohort is BV or bacterial Vaginosis - it is recurring so antibiotics often do not completely resolve the condition. We are interested in understanding AMR plays a role in this recurrance, but since we are interested in AMR to only a few drugs, we need to carefully select the tool for detecting the AMR genes in this cohort. We are going to basically repeat the methods (integrating your point in #2) to try to select the tool that can ""best"" detect the resistance for these three drugs in this cohort. I hope that makes it clearer! Again, thank you for taking the time to provide this feedback. These are all good points for improving the science.

You should check that. This is probably a signal picked up by tour neural network. Another reason could be your fixation and rehydration protocol that increases the ambient noise. - Yes, it is unexpected high. It is unlikely to be sequencing artefacts, as the spacer sequences are very different from each other in the libraries -- we tried to avoid mis-targeting effects of CRISPRi when designing these libraries. We hypothesize that the enrichment procedure of guide sequences exposes the ambient sgRNAs, this may explain why there are fewer ambient mRNAs comparing to sgRNAs. We also observed the presence of strong ambient signals in other datasets from other labs, please see supplementary Fig. 2. Together, we think this may be a systematic issue of single cell omics rather than specific experimental problem (e.g. impropriate infection). This is what scAR aim to solve. I like your idea of fixation and rehydration protocol. The preparation of single cell suspension definitely should have an impact on ambient noise. We briefly discuss this in the last paragraph in discussion section. - with a multiplicity of infection of 0.3, you do expect ~25% of the cells to have >2 guides. If you find less there is a problem. However your expression vs guide assignment argument is convincing for the accuracy of scAR so it might be worth checking the expression of the candidate second guide targets. - There should be a small fraction of multi-infection. The output of scAR is a matrix of Bayesian factors, one can set a global threshold on it to assign the guides, which should be able to distinguish single infection and multi-infection. As mentioned in the manuscript, the purpose here is to demonstrate the accuracy of scAR, so we do not use any arbitrary thresholds on either naive assignment and scAR. For a specific study, we would recommend to set a reasonable threshold on the output of scAR, although we will provide a default threshold for simplicity. We will demonstrate these in a tutorial. Many thanks again for your interest and comments. I wish you a great weekend.

We have begun doing preprint manuscript reviews during our “journal clubs” as a way to enhance our engagement with current literature and to hopefully assist with the manuscript if possible! Our lab also studies the behaviors of biomolecular liquid-solid transitions – with a focus on protein structure. We selected this manuscript out of curiosity for the spatial origins of solidification in liquid-liquid phase separated systems. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is central to the spatiotemporal organization of biomolecules in the cell. Many of the proteins that are thought to mediate LLPS have also been found in pathological aggregates and fibrils that are associated with neurodegenerative disease. It has been demonstrated that liquid-like phase separated bodies can adopt gel-like or solid morphologies over time, which suggests that LLPS droplets may serve as nucleation points for pathological aggregates. This manuscript interrogates this process by characterizing the spatial characteristics of the liquid-to-solid transition within individual alpha-synuclein condensates using a set of fluorescence and infrared microscopy techniques. The authors found that droplets solidify form a central focal point that can be imaged through associated changes in fluorescence lifetime (via fluorescence lifetime imaging, FLIM) and protein secondary structure (via Fourier transform infra-red microscopy, FTIRM). To emphasize this significance in the text, we think it may be helpful if the authors added more background and discussion of previous literature on the spatial origin of solidification. These findings are exciting as they add new insight into biomolecular liquid-to-solid transitions, and relevant due to the potential role for liquid-to-solid transitions in neurodegenerative disease. We find that the combination of fluorescence microscopy techniques used here presents a strong model for studying spatiotemporal material properties of biomolecular condensates, which are challenging to characterize from a structural perspective due to their inherent heterogeneity and sensitivity to environmental factors. The power of these techniques is shown in their ability to complement the FLIM data into protein mobility (FRAP), structure (FTIRM), and interaction (FRET) components, providing a comprehensive look into the liquid-to-solid transition. We appreciated the use of small fluorophores rather than fluorescent proteins, as well as the confirmation by fluorophore-free techniques (TEM & cryo-SEM). Overall, we find that the data and the resulting model for the spatiotemporal dynamics of the liquid-solid transition are compelling. One area we are curious about is the sample handling, keeping a sample hydrated for 20 days is difficult. Would you be able to add a few words about the robustness of this moisture chamber in the main text? These aspects of the experimental design might not be obvious to a reader unfamiliar with the practical considerations of experiments like this, so more discussion would be helpful to anyone trying to reproduce the experiments. In a similar vein, a paragraph about the practical aspects of FLIM in the context of LLPS would be helpful. We also wondered about the necessity of the solidification timeline, how would the microscopy procedures described here work for a system that progresses to solid much faster than 20 days? What are the time limitations of these techniques? Would a faster system be expected to have the same center-growth effect as seen here? We were surprised that droplets appear to solidify from the exact center of the droplet in every case. If the model for solidification is that it begins from a (random) nucleation point, then why would droplet solidification always begin exactly in the center, as opposed to the inner or outer center regions that are mapped in Figure 1. We were left wanting more information about this, especially since FLIM is capable of resolving changes on these scales. It would be interesting to see if there are any cases where solidification does not begin from the exact center of the droplet. Some minor comments: -While the figures are clear and well-organized, a more colorblind-friendly palette could be used. -Infrared is occasionally hyphenated throughout the text. -The abstract figure may be clarified if the FLIM images were all of a single droplet, matching the cartoon. -The schematics describing the planes on the droplet are beautifully done and very helpful to understanding the figures. -Figure 1: formatting error with (e) placement. -Figure 2: (c) As we are unfamiliar with FTIRM, we thought it may be useful to have the corresponding secondary structure to each wavenumber (like the supplementary table 1 information) in the figure. Similarly, while supplementary figure 7 has a monomer and fibril control, we would have enjoyed that in the main figure. -Figure 4: (c) We wonder how consistent these recoveries are for several different droplets at the same time point. -For the TEM data (Fig 5), the results are a little bit different from other attempts to perform TEM on LLPS systems (for example, here: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.... A discussion of precedent would be appreciated in the main text. -Supplementary Fig. 11: We thought these EM images were fascinating and are curious if such images exist elsewhere for biomolecular condensates. ---------------------------------------------- We appreciated the chance to read and review this manuscript, The Debelouchina Lab",2022-01-21T22:03:41,,Debelouchina Lab,10.1101/2021.10.20.465113,Spatiotemporal solidification of α-synuclein inside the liquid droplets,"Soumik Ray, Debdeep Chatterjee, Semanti Mukherjee, Komal Patel, Jaladhar Mahato, Sangram Kadam, Rakesh Krishnan, Ajay Singh Sawner, Manisha Poudyal, G Krishnamoorthy, Arindam Chowdhury, Ranjith Padinhateeri, Samir K.
