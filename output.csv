Your paper on random subcloning was a fun read! It's a similar result to MacArthur's Broken Stick model for species-abundance distributions, and a cool analysis. While the maximum fragment length has high variance under the null hypothesis you consider elegantly in random subcloning, it does not have high variance under engineered infectious clones. The statistic ends up being elegant because not only does it contain information on regular spaced-ness of the restriction sites, but it also relates directly to the bioengineering constraint of plasmid stability. If we assume the probability of prohibitive plasmid instability increases monotonically with fragment length, longest-fragment-lengths give us a meaningful lower-bound on the probability a given infectious clone is synthesizable. Consequently, we chose maximum fragment length as our summary statistic of the restriction map to capture both even-spaced-ness and synthesizability, believing this would be the best statistic (if we had to choose just one) for identifying infectious clones. That said, we're fascinated to see what future work lays ahead, and believe it's likely better statistics and classifiers of infectious clones may exist, although with such a small sample size it's also quite easy to dredge the data and so we chose one statistic very carefully & stuck with that in our work here. Thanks again! We'll be citing your random fragment paper in our updated version - very relevant, and super cool analysis!",2022-10-24T23:20:04,alexwashburne,Alex Washburne,10.1101/2022.10.18.512756,Endonuclease fingerprint indicates a synthetic origin of SARS-CoV-2,"Valentin Bruttel, Alex Washburne, Antonius VanDongen",2022-10-20

It was based on large-scale phylogenomic analysis and tried to explain the findings through biochemical and molecular points of view. On the general organization of this paper, a minor suggestion I would propose is including a workflow chart to explain how each experiment is connected to the question of investigation. Regarding the result, I noticed from Fig 5 that there are clear increases in acidic protein proportions for all transitions, but for the frequency of basic proteins, only the BM transition showed a slight increase. I was curious if there is an explanation for this. Additionally, I was a little confused if this paper is trying to suggest a causal relationship between functional gene content changes and cross-biome transitions, or if it aims at showing the association between these two events. Lastly, I was wondering if there are other ways (both computational and experimental) to validate the findings from this paper. Overall, this is a good paper with beautiful figures and in-depth analysis of molecular incidents in cross-biome transition. Thank you for presenting your work here!",2022-10-24T22:34:03,,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2022.10.03.510577,Large-scale phylogenomics of aquatic bacteria reveal molecular mechanisms for adaptation to salinity,"Krzysztof T Jurdzinski, Maliheh Mehrshad, Luis Fernando Delgado, Ziling Deng, Stefan Bertilsson, Anders F Andersson",2022-10-03

I’ve often read about this topic before, but this was a really novel take on the topic of antimicrobial resistance. Beginning with the introduction and abstract I thought there was sufficient background information provided on why this topic is important,  and why it is relevant to study today. In addition, it was also clear to me what the goal of this paper was (studying the effects of ARM-1 on Mfd). However, I would have preferred to see a little more background information on the Mfd compound. I understood how it operates to produce mutations, but I wish this compound was expanded upon a little more. Perhaps including some information on whether this compound is only seen in bacteria, and if not, are there any analogs in other organisms? Moving on to the first experiment, this was the only part of the study I had a little trouble understanding. I understood the underlying mechanisms that displayed the relationship of Mfd to the RNAP molecule, and how the ARM-1 compound thwarts this relationship. I just wish a little more context was provided as to how you arrived from 43 hits to ARM-1. When focusing on the next three figures presented I think that these were all done very well. I will, however, suggest for figure 2 perhaps splitting up the figure into two separate figures/parts. The first part containing information for figures 2A and 2B, and the next part containing information for figures 2C and 2D. I suggest this because the two halves of figure 2 discuss information that deals with separate topics. I thought that figure 3 was very clear and displayed your findings quite well! The only suggestion I have here is to define what “CTL” is. I tried to find a specific definition for this term in the paper but was unable to do so. Figure 4 was quite clear, and I found everything quite easy to understand! Overall, I really enjoyed reading this paper. This was a very interesting look into something I think many people have heard of in at least some context. I am very interested to see where this research goes next, as I believe it has a lot of potential to create a very positive impact throughout the world.",2022-10-24T22:09:32,jorawarsandhu,Jorawar Sandhu,10.1101/2022.09.26.509600,A small molecule that inhibits the evolution of antibiotic resistance,"Anna E.

I note - in 2000 we published a paper that is somewhat related to what you report here.  See https://genomebiology.biome.... In this we reported on how comparisons of closely / moderately closely related bacterial genomes showed that the distance a gene was from the origin of replication was conserved but the side of the origin it was on was not.  In comparisons of very close relatives, one can see the inversions that led to this pattern. In comparisons of slightly more distant relatives, one could not really see the inversions but we saw an X-like pattens of conservation. This has been seen now in many many other comparisons of bacterial and archaeal genomes. We discuss in the paper possible explanations for why this pattern is seen including mutation bias (e.g., more symmetric inversions than others) or selection (e.g., distance a gene is from the origin).",2022-10-24T16:48:31,jonathan_eisen,Jonathan Eisen,10.1101/2022.10.22.513359,A quantitative model for the transcriptional landscape of the bacterial cell cycle,"Andrew Pountain, Peien Jiang, Magdalena Podkowik, Bo Shopsin, Victor J Torres, Itai Yanai",2022-10-23

It was very informational and allowed for easy understandings of the goal of the research which i thought was pretty interesting. I did, however, have some questions about the main points. I think a point being proven was in regard to the  question about parasites expressing antigenic variation while in extracellular spaces. I was curious on when exactly the antigenic variation occurs. Is there a signal that notifies the parasite when to change the VSG coat also? I think ultimately these were questions the paper posed as well, however i think it could be beneficial to list some speculations on what you might think is occurring. It could help with providing some context in relation to this in the background. Also I was a bit unclear on the plan for future work. I didn't see it really discussed in detail, either that, or I wasn't sure if the questions you posed at the end of discussion was where the future work was headed. Overall, the paper was great i was able to fully emerge and and take interest in the topic despite this not being my primary discipline. Explanations were amazing, I would just narrow down on the points you weren't sure about because I also wasn't sure about it and others may not be as well.",2022-10-24T15:59:40,nyahjohnson,Nyah Johnson,10.1101/2022.06.27.497797,Extravascular spaces are reservoirs of antigenic diversity in Trypanosoma brucei infection,"Alexander Beaver, Nathan P.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.20.457079v3#comment-6020944090,biorxivstage,3,"In this paper, Weilnhammer et al. tackle an intruiging question at the heart of decision-making theory: do observers use stable strategies, or do their strategies ('modes') change within a session? This papers analyses the autocorrelation in perceptual decision-making, and finds that it fluctuates between externally- and internally-driven strategies in ways that are strikingly similar between humans and mice. I very much enjoyed reading this work. The topic is exciting, and together with the Ashwood paper (which I see as a companion) this work will undoubtedly spur many future developments across psychology and neuroscience. The author's commitment to open science is laudable, and I am glad to see them making such good use of open, large-scale, community-curated datasets. I do have a few questions that are important to fully understand and validate the author's conclusions, and several minor suggestions. My expertise lies in the analysis of behavioral data, so I will mostly comment on main figures 1-4 rather than the model in figure 5. I thank the authors for also sharing this work as a preprint. As a signatory of Publish Your Reviews, I have committed to publish my peer reviews alongside the preprint version of an article. Specfically, this review will also be posted on the bioRxiv comments section. For more information, see publishyourreviews.org. Major questions 1. Do mode fluctuations have a characteristic timescale? I find terminology like 'oscillated as 1/f noise' (l. 985) a bit confusing - there may be frequency-specific oscillations, *or* a 1/f spectrum, but these are not the same ( https://www.nature.com/arti.... While the 1/f characteristic is clearly shown in Figures 2D, 3D, 4D (and the authors discuss self-organized criticality), I could not reconcile this with some other aspects of the analyses and writing. First, are phase and coherence not usually computed as a function of frequency? If so, which frequency is used in Figure 2E,F? Methods section 7.3.4 and l. 148 could be elaborated for readers unfamiliar with spectral analyses of behavior (how should the units of coherence be intrepreted?). Second, how can the simulation with a phasic mode switch at a single frequency (Figure 5A) give rise to a 1/f spectrum (Figure 4D), rather than a spectrum with an oscillatory peak (l. 425)? Third, there is a long history of investigating oscillations in perception (work by Fries, VanRullen, Kastner and many others, as the authors cite) albeit at a much faster timescale than shown here. Since the unit in this manuscript is trials (not time), are these two lines of work inherently incomparable, or can something be said about the typical trial length and therefore the interpretation of the best-fitting f = 0.11 in their model fits (l. 890/891)? Throughout the manuscript, it would help to distinguish oscillatory vs. 1/f. Alternatively, I may fundamentally misunderstand the results, in which case further elaboration and clarification would be great. 4. It would be very helpful if the full set of figure panels (as in Figures 2, 3, 4) was reproduced for each of their control simulations (S4, S6, S7), to better compare these models' behavior against human and mouse data. This would increase confidence in the main findings, and further pinpoint what exact behavioral signatures are unique to bimodal inference (rather than arousal fluctuations or decision bouds). I would like to suggest further control analyses to strengthen the existing ones. First, to conclude that internal-external mode fluctuations do not reflect periods of 'limited capacity', 'energy budget' or 'unstructured neuro-cognitive noise' (section 5.3), can you simulate and fit data from a process that additionally (or only) has periods of low/high perceptual sensitivity or task engagement (for instance, simulating high lapses)? Especially in the mouse data (and shown by Ashwood, there are likely periods of disengagement from the task, e.g. when mice become satieted towards the end of the session. One prediction may be that this would lead to more errors in history-congruent modes (as in 3A), Second, recent work (reviewed in https://doi.org/10.51628/00... has shown that slow drifts in decision boundary, without any strategic history-dependent updating, may give rise to statistical confounds and apparent history-dependence. It is difficult to intuit how such a process may affect the analyses presented here: could the authors simulate a process with only a slowly drifting bound (beyond the static response bias in section 5.4)? Minor suggestions 1. I applaud the authors for sharing their full workflow on OSF. However, I did find the format (all files in a zip) a bit difficult to work with: for instance, it's not possible to view the code in-line without downloading. To further increase the usefulness of the codebase to others, consider exploring ways to present the code in a way that allows easy re-running, inspection and versioning (e.g. in a notebook form, or at least with the scripts on GitHub). Also, comments on how to use the files (where to start? how to install/run? what are the dependencies? what version of R?) would be of great help to others who want to implement the same method. 3. Could the authors show standard (and history-conditioned) psychometric curves in both modes? This would show if there are considerable lapses, which can bias the estimation of history-dependent logistic regression models (see http://www.journalofvision..... If lapses are considerable, this may need to be taken into account in the model (or at least simulated to check that it doesn't introduce confounds). Related to this, how many human studies did not have stimulus strength information (and thus presumably only one level of task difficulty), and do the results look the same without studies with these missing data? 17. The authors recognize that trial-to-trial variations in stimulus strength (i.e. task difficulty) are a major driver of choices, and account for this in their control analysis. However, when defining stimulus-congruence, this is (as far as I can tell) only done based on the sign (i.e. a binary indicator), thus removing the _degree_ of stimulus congruence. Would the results look the same is stimulus-congruence was instead coded as a continuous variable, i.e. being more congruent when stimulus strength is high? 18. Why not show the logistic regression results in Figure 2B, which takes into account several confounds that are now hidden in the supplement? 19. Why do the mixed effects models only have random intercepts, and not random slopes? It seems that sensory and history dependence vary substantially across observers, which random slopes could capture. 20. Consider visualizing the phase information (Figure 2E) on a circular plot. To better interpret the coherence and phase information (see my first main question), it would be very helpful to discuss whether the two modes are anti-correlated/alternate at a specific frequency. 21. Please define 'infra-slow' when first used (see first main question). Is this characterized by a specific frequency range? 22. I am unsure if the selection of IBL mouse sessions may affect these results. Specifically, the authors here use a simple performance criterion of 80% in easy trials. However, in this task contrasts were introduced gradually, meaning that 80% correct on easy trials may happen early on in training as well as very late (with very different contrast sets). In Figure S5, could it be indicated which sessions were incorporated into the main analysis? Would the results hold if using a more stringent criterion to consider animals 'trained', as proposed in the original IBL paper ( https://github.com/int-brai..., which also incorporates bias and lapses)? A related point is that TDs are a lot larger (Figure 3H) than in the original paper (IBL et al. 2021, Figure 3 - supplement 2A), which may be remarked upon. 23. Also Figure S5: it would be of great interest to also see the within-session changes in mode, for mice as well as humans (see also my main question above on satiety). 24. The green plots in Supplementary Figure 2 are interesting but also a bit worrying, showing all sorts of autocorrelation in the stimulus sequences that make the paper's conclusions trickier to assess. The authors already discuss some features of the IBL task design that introduce specific autocorrelation patterns (i.e. post-error bias correction). Is such information, describing the specific algorithms for sequence generation, available for the studies from the confidence database? And could the authors relate specific stimulus sequences to the behavioral modes they observe? 25. In section 5.7, it should be noted that mice did receive single-trial feedback. How about humans? Splitting the confidence database into those studies with and without single-trial feedback could be used to nicely test the predictions in line 549 / Figure 5. 26. RT distributions are characteristically long-tailed, which can strongly affect scaling them. I am a bit confused that all values in Figure 2H lie below zero, should this not be zero-meaned? Was a transform (e.g. log) used before zscore? If not, could the authors show the RT distributions per study before and after outlier removal and scaling, to give a better sense of the distributions that were used in the analyses (or replicate 2H without normalization so that the real RT units are visible, as in 3H)? It would also be nice to add the range of individual cutoff values used for exclusion criteria (l. 776). 27. To make the magnitude of weights in figure 2B, 3B and 4B easier to interpret, consider adding the weight for sensory stimuli (see Abrahamyan figure 3 - may need to be on a differen y-scale). 28. lines 436-445: are these correlations linear, or may there be quadratic relationships between posterior certainty and RT, confidence, TDs? A supplementary figure would be nice. 29. Very minor: I had some issues printing the figures, likely due to many transparent datapoints in the pdf. For the final version, consider exporting the figures to a high-resolution bitmap format to reduce the size. 30. The work contains a couple of remaining typos (e.g. ressource'), duplicate words, etc. 31. l. 148, S2F -> 2F. 32. l. 653, where in the Ashwood paper is this number of >100 trials mentioned? As far as I can tell, they only analyze the first 90 trials of each session (see their figure 3E). 33. Some references should be updated: for instance, 21 is now published in eLife, and 12 & 66 point to the same paper (published and preprint). Please check all the references to make sure that they point to the most recent versions. 34. Consider adding author contribution statement and/or displaying this visually (see e.g. https://twitter.com/Steinme..., https://elifesciences.org/a... figure 6). Also, is there a reason why one author is now omitted, compared to the first bioRxiv version? Further questions As with all fresh ideas, this work raises many more questions that it can answer: while beyond the scope of this manuscript, I list some here so that they may be of use to the community. - Especially together with the paper by Ashwood et al., the obvious next question is the structure of mode fluctuations: are there two modes (as suggested here) or more (as suggested by Ashwood)? Do these switch in a discrete vs. continuous way? - At what timescale do states/modes change? How does this relate to even slower timescales in biology, e.g. at the level of circadian rhythms? - It is fantastic to see that large-scale databases are increasingly being used for cross-species comparison. In a way, it's a shame that these exist only for humans and mice. Are there plans or efforts to collect and publish similar databases from non-human primates (where many, many trials of perceptual decision-making tasks have been collected over the years)?",2022-10-24T11:08:05,,Anne Urai,10.1101/2021.08.20.457079,Bimodal inference in humans and mice,"Veith Weilnhammer, Heiner Stuke, Kai Standvoss, Philipp Sterzer",2022-07-05
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.27.509833v1#comment-6020788144,biorxivstage,1,"Hello, my name is Sarah O’Malley, and I am a student of the Biomedical Research minor at UCLA. I recently read this paper with my program’s journal club, and I want to thank you for your work on mEVs and early biomarkers of tobacco smoking-induced disease. My class learned a great deal of information while reading and discussing this paper, and I would like to present some suggestions and comments: The variety of techniques utilized to isolate and characterize mEVs here were impressive. However, I suggest including percentage breakdowns of the different populations studied on the flow cytometry plots (Figure 2A, 2B, 2E). This data may have already been calculated through FlowJo or could easily be calculated with this software, and it would be valuable to display these percentages to provide more precise quantifications of EV populations. In addition, I believe that Figure 2D may have been incorrectly referred to as Figure 5D in the results section titled “Extracellular vesicle concentration increases in circulation 1 hour after smoking in never-smokers”. Also, in the results or discussion section, I would suggest including a description of why there are four post-smoking samples in Figure 2F compared to the 20 non-smoking participants or the nine pre-smoking samples shown in Figure 2F. Next, if possible, I would also suggest conducting the tests performed on nonsmokers in Figure 1 and 2 on smokers as well, which could provide additional data on the acute effects of smoking and if these effects change with the chronic smoking of tobacco. I understand that this data may be difficult to collect, but I believe that it could bolster the content of this paper. Lastly, I was wondering what specific statistical test you conducted for this figure. The figure legend states that a non-parametric unpaired t-test was performed. However, I wonder if a paired test should have been used, as this data consists of blood from the same individuals pre- and post-smoking. Thus, I do not know if the groups can be considered independent. Also, t-tests are parametric tests, so I am unsure of what a nonparametric t-test refers to. This pattern of referring to a nonparametric t-test was also maintained throughout the paper. Was a Wilcoxon signed-rank test performed? If not, then I would suggest implementing this statistical test here, as it serves a similar purpose to a t-test but is applicable to paired, nonparametric data. For the other instances of unpaired nonparametric t-tests, I would suggest using a Mann-Whitney U test, which also serves a similar purpose to a t-test but is applicable to unpaired, nonparametric data. In Figure 4B, I would suggest expanding the heatmap to display MFI levels for each sample analyzed instead of condensing the data as shown. In this condensed form, the data is a bit difficult to interpret. Alternatively, I would suggest displaying some of the quantifications of activation marker levels described in the results section, as these quantifications would convey the same message but through a more easily interpretable form. The discussion around Figure 5 depends on a trend shown in sTREM2 expression and a statistical decrease in BDNF expression. In the results and discussion sections, the following conclusions made about the smoking-linked mechanisms of neurodegeneration may be a bit strong based on this data. I would suggest performing follow-up experiments on other neurodegeneration markers to strengthen this evidence or perhaps test BBB functionality, as this was a concept linked to neurodegeneration throughout this paper. I have a quick general note on the references section. I had some trouble finding a few of the papers cited in-text in the references section (e.g. Zalba et al. 2007, Sophocles Chrissobolis et al. 2011). My class had similar difficulties navigating the references section, so I would suggest following up on the consistency of citations in-text and within this section.

Additionally, the analysis in the results and discussion were logical and easy to follow. I do think at times there is some confusion/ambiguity regarding the sample sizes for some tissues. In the methods section, you mentioned that 3 brain samples (2 day 10, 1 day 14) and 1 heart sample (day 10) were excluded from analysis. When talking about Figure 2A, you said that the initiating VSG was detectable in 23/24 tissue samples from day 10. I was wondering if that was supposed to be 20/21 tissue samples? I had a similar comment with figure 3C and figure 4, where the legends say that n = 4 for each tissue. I think it would be helpful to mention that n=2 for day 10 brain samples and n = 3 for day 10 heat/day14 brain samples in the legends of figures 3 and 4 in case a reader did not catch that in the methods section. I also had two minor comments regarding figures. For 2A and 2C, since you are comparing the blood to tissue spaces collectively, I don’t think having the tissues being different colors is necessarily useful. It might be visually beneficial if all tissue samples were the same color (i.e. blue) like they are in 3B.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.05.510968v1#comment-6020623263,biorxivstage,0,"This manuscript presents a wealth of supporting data for evidence of vocal learning and conformity among whale songs in the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus). Romagosa and colleagues present a twenty-one yearlong observational study of three critical components of the songs produced by male fin whales. It is the first study to suggest a mechanism driving vocal learning and conformity in animal songs, specifically pertaining to the fin whale. Romagosa & colleagues’ comprehensive analysis includes a dearth of both temporal and spatial data. The assessment the inter-note interval (INI, i.e., rhythm), the 20-Hz note, and the High Frequency (HF) note of the fin whale song is used as a conduit by which the authors reveal patterns of change and adoption of different patterns over time. The authors use a wide geographical range, inclusive of 15 sampling locations grouped into 7 separate regions, with data collection spanning between 1999 and 2020. They provide thorough consideration of alternate interpretations of their data and use the existing literature to further bolster their proposed ideologies. This manuscript has immense potential to posit something novel to the field, based on the background the authors have provided. However, due to the seeming overreliance on existing literature in the discussion, limited exploration and elaboration on the data itself in the results section, and poor articulation of caveats in the sampling methodology, the significance of the findings presented are undermined. Based on the targeted journal, a re-organization of the manuscript’s structure may be suitable to address these more structural issues. Despite the incredible amount of data, there lacks thorough explanations of how the data directly supports the conclusions presented. The results section could be elaborated upon to increase the credibility of the stated conclusions (examples starting in line 93 through 106, 119 – 127, 136-144). The discussion section does not implicate the data presented in this paper in the conclusions being made by the authors as much as it should, and it seems to rely much more heavily on existing literature in the greater field (i.e., extending beyond marine mammals). Switching some of the description of the data from the discussion section into the results section will make both sections easier to read and understand. . As these studies are purely observational, the methodology should be highlighted more, and as stated previously, perhaps may merit a structural reorganization of the manuscript itself. Because of the several sampling differences such as those in instrumentation & manufacturer, including the supporting evidence for why these data are still usable and comparable is critical to the credibility of the work (see Supplementary Material, lines 30 – 50). This experiment should be included either in the main body of the text or highlighted more explicitly in the main body, so the reader knows to find it there. The inconsistencies between recording machinery need to be explained, as the authors have performed an additional study to verify these data. Using figure 1 to be referenced primarily by the methods section is a poor choice of ordering, and perhaps the visuals provided in figure 1 can be moved into the supplement since they are not showing any data. This would leave available a spot to move the experiment in the supplementary material into the main text. Additionally, including more detailed figure legends (i.e., explaining that each symbol represents an individual recording/represents one day, explaining the red circle in current figure 1A in the legend, etc.). The same descriptive wording used in the legend for Figure 3 (specifically the information provided in line 133 – 135) should be applied to all figures in both the main and supplemental data. The rationale for the groupings of regions in the histograms of INIs and HF note peaks in Figures 4A & B is unclear and not indicated. Figure 4B is not discussed in the text either. Having panels in figures that are not described in the text is confusing, as the reader cannot understand what the purpose is of what is being presented. Generally speaking, the manuscript was a delight to read. It was well-written, and I felt that the background and foundation for the work presented was laid out very well. This data that is being presented has exciting implications for the field and fills in a clear gap in knowledge. The amount of time and dedication that was given to these studies should not be understated. I felt that the authors framed their goals and provided comprehensive context for the material being shown.

As for feedback, I gathered from the article that this research contributes to the notion that scientists need a new way to think about targeting antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Here you provide the audience with a new method of preventing the bacteria from evolving at all. While previous interventions focused on killing the evolved bacteria. However, did you ask questions about addressing the bacteria that have already developed into something like, let’s say MRSA? Your approach evaluated in this research is new and innovative, but it does not mention the life of the bacteria after it has evolved as a limitation. With that said, I feel it would greatly benefit this article to contain a limitation section so you could reflect on possible improvements for future work and shortcomings of the current work. Other questions to address in this section would be what happens if AMR bacteria does evolve and what parameters are in place to inhibit it? Specifically, you leave the audience wondering how ARM-1 can be used medically. I feel since this is a huge component of why you did this research, it should be addressed in the conclusions section. How can it be used? For whom? What would access look like? Where is it most needed? Who and what countries could benefit? Why is this intervention the best course of action for people?  How could it actually be used as an anti-evolution drug? There is a disconnect for me when I compare the outcome of the research and how it can meaningfully impact medicine beyond just stating that it can. Although this paper was scientific, it is dense for someone coming from a non-science background to digest. I did feel it was logical and well-written but could have benefited from being broken up into more sections. I found myself rereading the results section since you combined the methods, results, and figures altogether and only had four subheadings. Although you have a discussion section, I felt that your discussion section was actually in your results section and that your discussion section acted as a conclusion section. This made it challenging for the reader to synthesize the results section in an efficient manner. From reading the summary, I felt the main idea is that the inhibition of Mfd activity by the lead compound ARM-1 delays the development of mutations and resistance acquisition in pathogens. This finding then demonstrates that molecular mechanisms are targetable which ultimately could prevent AMR in future pathogens. If this is not what you are trying to convey, then I would advise reworking your summary and or introduction. I agree with others that replication of the study could benefit more concrete findings to solidify the argument this article is making. I do feel this paper dives into some really interesting questions which I feel need to be explored further. In terms of the next steps and future experiments, figuring out how your research fits into the lifecycle of the AMR bacteria could prove insightful. Overall, good job, it is an important research topic that has not been addressed in the way you present it and I feel it is adding to the field of science.

Thus, any hypothetical engineer of the RE sites would have to go to enormous lengths to purposefully mimick natural bat coronaviruses that have only been discovered in the past 2 years: a very dubious proposition. The far simpler alternative is that the sites evolved via natural recombination from natural bat coronaviruses. Further, if one examines the genomic regions around each restriction enzyme sites, we find that SARS-CoV-2 shares general genetic similarity with the virus(es) it shares the RE site (or lack therefore) with. This would further indicate that they were inherited via recombination. For example, two BsaI sites missing in SARS-CoV-2 are also missing in the RpYN06 batCoV, which follows naturally from the phylogenetic prediction that RpYN06 is the nearest neighbor in that region. Correspondingly, SARS-CoV-2 shares not just the lack of the BsaI sites in this region, but several other mutations as well: a signal entirely inconsistent with engineering and entirely consistent with natural recombination. The same is true with other natural batCoVs if you examine any of the RE sites described in this work. For the engineering hypothesis, this would have to imply that someone not only modified the RE sites to match natural viruses, but also unrelated nearby sites as well - an even more ludicrous proposition that I do not think even these authors can defend. Finally, this sort of analysis can be be done systematically by reconstructing a recombinant ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, as the two papers below did: https://www.nature.com/arti... (See Fig 2) https://www.science.org/doi... (See Fig 6) The recombinant ancestor is a reconstruction of the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and other known bat viruses in each region of the genome. The recombinant ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 indeed shares the exact BsaI/BsmBI RE pattern of SARS-CoV-2, minus a signal synonymous mutation: thus further proving that these sites were naturally acquired via recombination. This follows intuitively from the observation that different bat viruses each have some of the RE sites described in this work, and that each bat virus that shares an RE or lack therefore with SARS-CoV-2 is the most recent common ancestor of that genomic region.

And the data described in my comment is fully available at: https://github.com/alexcrit... In particular, the file with 'alignment-with-RpYN06.fasta' which includes a comparison with several batCoVs ignored in this preprint. Let us be clear, this is firm phylogenetic proof that the RE pattern in this work is natural.

Just goes to show the strength of researcher collaboration for the purposes of broadening our understanding of important topics. I do, however, have some comments on your paper which I would like to share. I should preface this with a  statement of reflexivity - noting that I am not a marine biologist or within an associated field of interest, but have a background in the social sciences and an interest in One Health. Further, as a current academic and researcher in the social sciences I view your work through the lenses inherent to my discipline. I acknowledge the limitation that my lack of prior technical knowledge in this field brings, and intend to provide a critical perspective that may conform to those that also view your paper without prior technical knowledge. That said, I was initially drawn to your article because of your title. As such, based on your title I was expecting to read about a novel new notion of 'song conformity among fin whales'. Through your background, and discussion sections, I learnt that song conformity is an established notion for many animals, and species of whales - including fin whales (Line 243). So, while the title is clear and short, it also leads the reader to expect to learn about a new concept that is 'song conformity', but you later note that evidence of song conformity exists among fin whales already. Perhaps your paper would benefit from a reevaluation of the title to clarify that you intend to show, through a synthesis of multiple study datasets, trends within fin whale songs over a long time horizon. In your abstract, I thought you presented your main arguments quite well (Lines 25-28), though could have added a little more detail on your methodological choice and your study population (male fin whales) - perhaps in Lines 23-24. In Line 29, you note that you found ""evidence of vocal learning of rhythm"" and ""conformity"" - these are strong findings - and I was keen to read more. I thoroughly enjoyed reading your introduction, and I was most interested in reading your problem statement - and more specifically, the gap in the literature that you were trying to fill. In Lines 59-63 you note four distinct gaps that is our understanding of (1) the functional mechanisms of vocal learning, (2) natural selection and learning strategies, (3) the benefits of song conformity and (4) individual decisions impacting song evolution. You also note that ""vocal learning of rhythm is ... poorly understood"" [Line 62], and research focuses on complex songs. You call for ""a broader view"" to piece a part the different mechanisms of vocal learning to better understand prevalence and evolution [Lines 63-65]. Here I was anticipating a little more detail on what you meant by ""different mechanisms"". Also, while it was certainly interesting to read about all the gaps in our understanding of vocal learning and conformity, it wasn't immediately clear to me which of these gaps your work was seeking to address. A little more clarity here would have helped. In your methods section, I was intrigued to read about the processes that were involved in the creation of your analytical dataset. It seems like you had some challenges synthesizing inconsistent recordings which created some gaps in your dataset, and necessitated the exclusion of some data. Since the data was so critical to your examination of trends in songs over time, it would have helped to provide a figure tracking the data itself - e.g., the amount/type/nature of data that was available to you, the amount/type/nature of data that was excluded, and the amount/type/nature of data that made it into your final analytical dataset. Furthermore, I would have liked to have read a little more about your statistical assumptions. You employ the use of histograms to compare song distributions among periods/regions, I would have liked to have read a little more about whether you performed statistical analyses to assess distributional similarities (KS test?). In your results section, Figure 2 was intended to demonstrate song changes over time. Using the ONA SE dataset you present avg. song INIs over time, a stacked bar chart summarizing the three song types within the period, and a spatial presentation of this stacked bar chart. Maybe I missed it, but it wasn't clear to me how you technically defined and labelled ""hybrid"" songs in your dataset - from Figure 2 Panel A I noticed song INIs that fell within the 12s-19s range but the confidence intervals appeared to overlap into both the 12s and 19s ranges. Without further information, this did not appear to be clear evidence of a hybrid song. Much more clarity on how you defined hybrid songs, as well as an accompanying (supplementary) table on statistical summaries would strengthen your work here in my opinion. Figures 3 and 4 intended to show long term song trends (in avg. song INIs and two song parameters), and distributional comparisons of song INIs for regions and periods where simultaneous recordings were made, respectively. Much more clarity on the organization and interpretation of the data for Figure 3A would have been appreciated. Multiple ocean regions are plotted on the same graph, and a trend line is plotted through them. My first question is, are these regions comparable enough to be plotted side-by-side? For in other words, did these regions start from the same origin point? Is the trend being largely driven by ONA or the BBIC? Finally, in your discussion section, you do a good job contextualizing your research. And, explain your results through factual and counter-factual arguments (e.g., these results can't mean 'this' because if they did 'this' is what we would have found). At times, you extend the meaning behind your results a little too far for comfort - for example, when describing your results in the context of mating [Lines 241-254]. The arguments make sense, but without further evidence, it veers into conjecture. Though, in my opinion, this is a problem with the way you've framed your discussion pieces rather than a problem with the content itself. It would have been helpful to read a section on the limitations of your study design, and limitations of your study findings which would have clarified areas where you noticed anomalous results (such as the Barents Sea findings). All-in-all good work, though as a lay-reader, I did need more information at times and some clarity on your processes.",2022-10-22T22:22:22,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2022.10.05.510968,Fin whale singalong: evidence of song conformity,"Miriam Romagosa, Sharon Nieukirk, Irma Cascão, Tiago A.

I have a hard time telling the difference. Also, when I do Golden Gate cloning, the restriction sites are erased as they are designed to be in in opposite orientations to each other such that the ligated piece no longer has the restriction sites. This enables assembly in one tube by incubating the pieces in the presence of both the restriction enzyme and the ligase. How would introduction of these restriction sites be of benefit for Golden Gate or any other type of cloning? Because the restriction sites aren't removed, one can't simply digest the DNA and ligate the pieces in in one reaction as the restriction enzyme will cut all the sites again as you put each piece in.

I was also very glad to see that ARM-1 can delay the onset of AMR in multiple strains and even in strains that already devleoped resistance, which looks much promising/hopeful. However, I do have some questions about your experimental design and results. So for your highthrough-put drug screen, I saw that you used two plasmids, one with IPTG-inducible promoter, the other one with LacI/LacO roadblock. I just wonder if IPTG, which mimics allolactose, would have any off-target effect on LacI repressor? I can clearly tell that your ARM-1 inhibits mfd by your following results, but I was just wondering why you did not use any promoter that is inducible by any compounds other than allolactose analog. (Also I could only see panel 1a for supplementary figure 1, did you forget to upload the other panels?) Another question is about Figure 2c. I noticed that with the presence or absence of ARM-1, the EC values are roughly the same in this figure. You reasoned it as ""The reduction in the ECs in the presence of ARM-1 is most likely because, at equilibrium, when RNAP cannot dissociate from DNA, it cannot re-initiate transcription, consequently preventing new EC formation."", which did not make much sense to me at first. If that is the case, the EC value with ARM-1 should still be higher than that of the group without ARM-1, unless ARM-1 is not working at all. So I checked the supplementary material, and found that you repeated the expeiment, and the mean value for ARM-1 -ve group is 0.40, that for ARM-1 +ve group (different conc) range from 0.6-0.8, and this makes much more sense now. So I think if you should put the mean value in Fig 2c instead? (For supplementary figure 3, in panel a I saw two 25 and one 12.5 microM ARM-1 tested, but in panel b I saw two 12.5 microM and one 25 microM in the table, you might want to double check on that.)

Also the labeling of the x-axes for figures 4B and 4C was really confusing. 4B- I interpreted the label as though this measurement was done in only one mouse, but then this wouldn't be possible because the mouse would have been killed on day 10 and measurements couldn't have been done on day 14. Not until I read the text section. Maybe I'd advise that you add n=4 to this figure to indicate that 4 mice were monitored for each tissue. This was the same case for 4C. Ideally, one is supposed to look at the figure and get all the necessary information from it without checking the text part of the results for more information about what the figure is communicating.",2022-10-22T02:13:33,martinakathryn,Martina Kathryn,10.1101/2022.06.27.497797,Extravascular spaces are reservoirs of antigenic diversity in Trypanosoma brucei infection,"Alexander Beaver, Nathan P.

It is my pleasure to make these remarks. The work is well structured, well researched, and properly presented, easy to read even for non-scientific audiences. When going through the details though, I could not keep the concepts of hospital-acquired infections, antibiotic resistance, and the emergence of novel diseases out of my mind, particularly because of how they are linked to the overall concept of microbial diversity and adaptability. For antimicrobial resistance, for instance, the underlying factor has everything to do with the transfer of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) between two genomes. When MGEs access the chromosomes of new bacterial hosts, the outcome is phenotypical alteration. If the MGEs contained antibiotic resistance then novel or ongoing pathogenesis may result. Nevertheless, your study has demonstrated that bacterial species rarely cross environmental barriers. However, it is interesting to note that this is not the entirety of the results because there are distinct transitions between aquatic biomes, which, noteworthy, are ancient, rare, and often directed towards the brackish biome. At the same time, there are frequent transitions into brackish sites, which are harder to explain. I am just concerned, are there tests that can ascertain these claims? Previous studies have identified that bacteria are opportunistic and may manipulate any loophole to establish supremacy. The concern is further aggravated by your additional findings, that brackish bacteria often exhibit enriched gene functions for various physiological responses, including transcriptional regulation, which is integral in the re-writing genetic information, further begging the question should there be a cause for worry.",2022-10-22T00:15:10,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2022.10.03.510577,Large-scale phylogenomics of aquatic bacteria reveal molecular mechanisms for adaptation to salinity,"Krzysztof T Jurdzinski, Maliheh Mehrshad, Luis Fernando Delgado, Ziling Deng, Stefan Bertilsson, Anders F Andersson",2022-10-03

As for panel 2C, the figure shows the INI song type spatial gradient in transition period. But do whales stay in one place? Can there be repeated measure? Is it possible that a particular whale or group of whales was sampled twice at two adjacent sampling location? Maybe you'd like to do a short one or two sentence discussion of the impact of whale migration on data collection. Also, have you tried using some type of tracer to track a particular whale? I was wondering if you could track the song of one whale, and the songs of other whales around it. If you have data on that, I'm very curious what that looks like.

The authors identified a small molecule (ARM-1) that inhibited the RNA polymerase-associated DNA translocase Mfd, a protein shown to be involved in the development of antimicrobial resistance, and inhibited its ability to dissociate stalled RNAPs from DNA and had a modest impact on intrinsic ATPase activity of Mfd. The assays used were well suited for the study and revealed ARM-1's ability to inhibit Mfd and reduce the rate of mutation in bacteria grown in culture and during the course of infection of a human cell line. The authors also highlight that there was no detectable resistance of the bacteria to ARM-1 and that ARM-1 is able to deter the development of anitmicrobial resistance in diverse bacterial species. Only minor edits to spelling and grammar would be suggested. For example, the figure caption for Figure 4 says that the ""Concentration of ARM-1 used against S. enterica is 50 uM,"" however, S. enterica was not one of the species indicated in the figure.

I really hope you can address these issues before certain “news” organizations gets ahold of this. One criterion for IVGA is even spacing of cut sites, yet the SARS-CoV-2 BsaI/BsmBI fingerprint includes a tiny 643nt fragment within nsp13/helicase. This region is identical to SARS except for a single I->V mutation, so why would anyone engineering this virus want to separate this fragment to then do nothing to it? I prefer to believe this is just a cherry-picked pair of restriction enzymes and random noise. One could argue that this is similar to the less even iWIV1 cuts (Figure 2B), but iWIV1’s shortest fragment is still much larger than SARS-CoV-2’s and is only so short because of plasmid instability reported by Zeng et al. This unstable region is, however, very far from SARS-CoV-2’s short fragment, so again I see no reason why anyone would need this short fragment for engineering. Relatedly, although the longest fragment length is minimized when cuts are perfectly even spaced, statistics based on longest fragment length are not robust against tiny fragments and lead to false positives. Accounting for all fragment length by fitting to Poisson/exponential distributions would give better statistics, and I’m sure that SARS-CoV-2 would become less significant i.e. nothing in Figure 3A looks at all like Figure 2A.",2022-10-21T16:40:50,disqus_8AVEuorTBu,disqus_8AVEuorTBu,10.1101/2022.10.18.512756,Endonuclease fingerprint indicates a synthetic origin of SARS-CoV-2,"Valentin Bruttel, Alex Washburne, Antonius VanDongen",2022-10-20

I knew nothing about fin whales, so I had a lot of questions. If the public targeted by this article are not fin whale specialist, I think it could be helpful to add more information about their reproductive behavior and their immigration pattern. The question I asked myself were: Do the fine whales migrate? If they do what their migration pattern? Do they come back at the same place at the reproduction period? I think the article needs to give us the proof that population that measured overtime at different place are not the same, that there is no replacement of a group by another one, do the group get mixed? Since the authors are looking at evidence of song learning and conformity, I think it is important to ascertain that we are talking about different population across different geographic location and not the same group that would be recorded over different time period at different place. I don't think there was a tracker device, that would have help or at least it more information about the fin whale behavior during the reproduction period need to be clarify. I would suggest providing more information about the data collection, or in the discussion explain why all regions were not sampled in all years and time periods.

The idea of inhibiting the evolution of antimicrobial resistance is fascinating and creative. And I’m very excited to see a brand-new potential solution to AMR. But I think this paper can be even better if there’s more clarification for people without rich related backgrounds. As for the abstract and introduction part, I understand that researchers chose Mfd as a target based on their previous research. But I’m curious if there is any other reason why they chose Mfd as a target? For example, if there is any other advantages of targeting Mfd. Or if there have already been studies focusing on molecules targeting Mfd so there’s already material for this research. Also, I’m curious whether there are any other possible targets for anti-evolution. Maybe going deeper into possible mechanisms of anti-evolution could help me even better understand the importance of this research. As for the methods, I believe it’s already clear enough.

If he has evidence of zero coverage at relevant sites in the 'vast majority of samples' then we encourage him to share it. Likewise, it would be of great utility if he could provide evidence of miscalls at positions 8782/28144 in the Sichuan/Wuhan C/C intermediate genomes. Bafflingly, Pekar et al. include over 50 genomes from the Lin et al (2021) dataset in their analysis but chose to exclude 12 C/C intermediate genomes from the same dataset (we identified 12 additional C/C intermediates that they did not consider that we note in our bioRxiv preprint). This is inconsistent with Dr Crits-Christoph's claim. that the 'vast majority...had no coverage at the relevant sites'. On what basis did they choose to retain these >50 genomes, but discard the C/C intermediates? This appears to be a clear case of selection bias. The genomes generated by Lin et al (2021) are of variable coverage - however, from their Table S2 the average % coverage with > 1 read is 95.5% (for Sichuan genomes). The likelihood is therefore that most genomes will have coverage at position 8782 (and given that all positions 28144 are called as C, it can be assumed that these all have coverage there, as Wuhan-Hu-1 has T at this position). A case in point regarding the quality of the Lin et al dataset: C/C intermediate EPI_ISL_451389 has 99.8% coverage with  > 10X read depth. This is a good quality genome therefore. Problems with the inferences made regarding claimed A and B specific SNVs in some of the C/C intermediates were discussed in: https://zenodo.org/record/7... Here is an updated summary: ' Seven intermediate genomes were excluded for possessing what were described as A, B or a combination of A and B specific SNVs.The rationale given was that these were A or B lineage genomes that acquired convergent mutations at positions 8782 and 28144 to produce C/C or T/T genotypes. However, if a B lineage genome acquired the mutation T28144C, converting it into a C/C intermediate, this would be a reversion mutation rather than a convergent mutation. In addition, no data was provided to demonstrate that a particular SNV was A or B specific. Four of the genomes had only one A or B specific (however defined) SNV (EPI_ISL_1069206 had one A specific SNV, while EPI_ISL_451390 and two unidentified genomes had one B specific SNV each). These could just as easily represent homoplasies that arose via convergence. No caveat to this effect was included in Pekar et al. Whether the remaining 3 genomes that had more than one SNV (claimed as A or B specific) are located intermediate between lineage A and lineage B genomes on a phylogenetic tree, or were phylogenetically aberrant, was not tested by the authors.' Dr Crits-Christoph claims some of the C/C intermediates are 'phylogenetically aberrant'. One way he could substantiate this is by showing this on a phylogenetic tree (remembering that homoplasies result in 'phylogenetic aberrance', indeed this is one of the manners in which they are detected). 21844 will be changed to 28144 in the next version of the preprint, thankyou for noting",2022-10-20T23:49:36,disqus_plWzQuLdvi,Steven Massey,10.1101/2022.10.10.511625,Statistical challenges for inferring multiple SARS-CoV-2 spillovers with early outbreak phylodynamics,"Alex Washburne, Adrian Jones, Daoyu Zhang, Yuri Deigin, Steven Quay, Steven E Massey",2022-10-13

However, it would be useful to provide a more detailed description of the methods, particularly to clarify the following points: Q1: The training labels are applied to 200bp bins, but the input sequences are expanded to 1Kbp centered on each bin. I'm confused about how the labels propagate when the windows are expanded. Let's say you have a negative bin that neighbors a positive bin. When you expand the 1Kbp window around the negative bin, the input sequence will encompass the positive bin. Is this 1Kbp input then labeled as positive or negative? Q2: When you split the data into training/validation/test, do you randomly choose bins or restrict them to particular chromosomes? If you randomly choose 200bp bins for your test data, won't the sequences from the test bins also be present in the training set (because of the way that windows are expanded to 1Kbp)? Q3: How were the Enformer and Basenji2 models trained? Are they trained on all data at once (i.e., multi-headed output model) or on each dataset separately?

In fact, they are more likely the consequence of superspreading events that occurred after introduction, such as Mardi Gras. Introductions don't cause polytomies, superspreading does. Second, you've actually made our point for us: the problem with FAVITES is precisely that it models within-host evolution while also spreading superspreading events over timescales during which within-host evolution can occur. Whereas real-world superspreading can take place in hours, FAVITES superspreading will take place over the entire infectious period. With a stationary propensity of within-host mutations, FAVITES will have a much higher probability of turning a 3-hour choir-practice superspreading event into a 9-day event (with many being extremely long, due to the exponential distribution of infectious periods in the model). This isn't a good model of superspreading-evolution of SARS-CoV-2. The genomic data for the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is not peculiar - it's exactly like the other early-outbreak polytomies you cited, and those weren't caused by spillover, they were caused by superspreading. Some of the efforts to see peculiarities in early outbreak genomes/trees are also prone to observer bias. I can look at a license plate in front of me - NGK 190 - and say ""what are the odds of *exactly* that? I can run a null model of license plates and say ""basically no chance of that"". Then, I can make a license plate that's restricted in my favor. It'll have a much higher odds of NGK 190. That doesn't mean my new model is right.

Review synthesized by Ruchika Bajaj. This study has developed a novel one-step methodology for the incorporation of membrane proteins from cells to lipid Salipro nanoparticles for structure-function studies using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), which is a profound technology in the field of membrane protein structural biology. We raise some points that may strengthen the manuscript below: Main section, 4th paragraph  “ resuspended in digitoxin-containing buffer ”- Does the sentence mean that membrane proteins were solubilized by detergent before reconstitution into salipro particles? Are salipro and digitoxin added at the same step? If this is the case, it is unclear how one can distinguish between the step wise solubilization and reconstitution or direct reconstitution into salipro particles. Further discussion on the mechanism of reconstitution would be helpful. In the same paragraph, the fragment “to increase membrane fluidity and render lipids” raises the question of whether the concentration of digitonin was optimized to balance the increase in membrane fluidity but not rendering the solubilization of membrane proteins. Main section, 4th paragraph, “ the formation of saponin-containing mPANX1-GFP particles was assessed by analytical size exclusion chromatography using fluorescence detector ” -  It is assumed that fluorescence is detected from GFP. As the construct expressed is PANX1-GFP, GFP fluorescence signal will be received from reconstituted as well as not reconstituted PANX1. Is saponin specific signal being used as a signal for measuring the reconstitution of PANX1-GFP? In the same paragraph, “ PreScission protease for on-column cleavage ” is mentioned. Is GFP still intact in the expressed PANX-1 or is it cleaved? A diagram of these procedures showing the various steps will be helpful for readers. Main section, 4th paragraph “ SDS-PAGE revealed the formation of pure and homogeneous Salipro-mPANX1 nanoparticles ”- However, extra bands are present above the major band in Figure 1E, can some comment be provided on this point. Possible explanations for the additional bands could be post translational modifications or degradation of mPANX1. Methodology section, “ membrane protein reconstitution screening using fluorescence-detection size exclusion chromatography (FSEC)” -The amount of salipro is given in ug. A comment on the ratio of protein to salipro particles would be important to decide the concentration of salipro with respect to the mass of the cell pellet. Figure 1G: The molecular weight of Salipro-mPANX1 particles is mentioned to be approximately 466kD. mPANX1 weighs about 48kD and heptamer will be 336kDa. A discussion on comparison of experimental and actual molecular weight would be interesting. hPANX1 was expressed in sf9 insect cells. A description regarding trials of expression of this construct in expi293 cells would be informative. Supplemental Figure 1B: The gel is overloaded and shows multiple bands for hPANX1, recommend selecting an alternative image for hPANX. Paragraph 6A phrase, “challenged with bezoylbenzoyl-ATP(bzATP), spironolactone and cabenoxolone ” - Please explain the meaning of ‘challenged’ here. Supplementary Figure 2: Paragraph 6 mentions “ binding constant could not be determined ”. Please provide an explanation for this. Is it about the saturation phase not being approachable because of the feasibility of the binding experiment at higher concentration of cabenoxolone? The last summary sentence in Paragraph 6 is not clear, recommend rephrasing it. Figure 2A shows that Salipro particles have His tag. This suggests that an additional step of affinity purification with His tag could have been used to distinguish or separate reconstituted and un-reconstituted PANX1. Supplementary figure 4: Please explain whether the datasets for samples in the presence and absence of fluorinated lipids were combined together. Paragraph 8, “ intracellular helices were not well resolved ” - Please comment on a possible explanation. Does the Salipro scaffold contribute to the resolution? Please mention any future possibilities regarding improving the resolution by modifying the salipro scaffold or alternative scaffold. In the same paragraph, rmsd is mentioned at promoter level, please comment on how this value changes at heptamer level and why is it important to report the rmdd value to appreciate the direct reconstitution methodology. Last paragraph 10, “future membrane protein research” - Please comment on the utility of this methodology on prokaryotic membrane proteins, bacterial outer or inner membrane proteins or eukaryotic membrane proteins. Some more examples of reconstitution with the same method will support the applicability of this methodology on diverse kinds of membrane proteins.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.10.511625v1#comment-6014068497,biorxivstage,2,"In this preprint, Washburrne and colleagues put forth some reasoning and basic analysis that they believe suggests the viral genomic data from the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is consistent with a single spillover event. This is in contrast to the work of Pekar et al. 2022 Science, which concluded that the genomic data from the early pandemic is best explained by multiple independent spillover events from an animal population. However, this preprint misrepresents the findings of Pekar et al. 2022, and makes several conceptual errors that fundamentally undermine their conclusions. There are 4 basic features of the early SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny that are each largely inconsistent with a single spillover event: A Lineage A ancestral haplotype is inconsistent with the molecular clock: Lineage B exhibits more divergence from the root of the tree than would be expected if lineage A were the ancestral virus in humans (Pekar Fig S20, S19). Two basal polytomies of lineages A and B were formed at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, whereas most single introductions within a city, location, or event are characterized by a single polytomy. There are no plausible candidates for intermediate genomes observed for lineages A and B. Both Lineage A and Lineage B are connected to and were present during the outbreak at the Huanan Seafood Market, and there was sustained case transmission within the market for up to a month. The authors have *attempted* (unsuccessfully) to address points 2 and 3, but they have entirely ignored points 1 and 4, which are still highly pertinent. All four of these observations need to be explained by any hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 origins. Now, on to specific scientific errors in this work: 1. In the first section, the authors describe how superspreading events can create polytomies, as do introduction events. This is an intuitive observation, as both superspreading events and successful introductions can result from rapid transmission from a singular infection source. What they fail to note, however, is that superspreading events and introduction events are characterized by a single polytomy, not by two. Here is a simple list of introduction/superspreading events characterized by a single polytomy: New Zealand https://www.nature.com/arti... Lombardy https://www.nature.com/arti... Louisiana (Mardi Gras superspreading event) https://www.sciencedirect.c... Xinfadi market in Beijing https://academic.oup.com/ns... In none of the above cases of introduction/superspreader events do we observe two basal polytomies separated by two mutations with no intermediates as we do for early SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. Ironically, the authors cite Popa et al. 2020 Nature Communications on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria as an example of how polytomies can be linked to superspreader events. However, this work elegantly describes how each polytomy results from a separate introduction event into Austria: Vienna-1 clade/polytomy: connected to an index patient from Italy. Tyrrol-1 clade/polytomy: phylogenetically linked to North America. Vienna-3 clade/polytomy: connected to Cluster OG, an independent travel-associated cluster. Tyrrol-3 clade/polytomy: connected to Cluster D, an independent travel-associated cluster. So indeed, the cited work is actually more strong evidence that introduction events — including those of a ‘superspreader’ nature — are characterized by a single polytomy. We see no instances of a single superspreader event creating two concurrent polytomies, separated by two or more mutations, as we observe with the rise of lineages A and B in Wuhan. It is not merely the existence of polytomies in a phylogeny that is relevant, but the observed ratio of polytomy frequency and size, which Pekar et al. simulations predict would arise very infrequently with a single introduction. Further, the authors are incorrect in their characterization of the FAVITES models used by Pekar et al. FAVITES has been modified to accurately recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 superspreading nature; see Worobey et al. 2020 Science, Figure S2. Washburne et al. say: “and the transmission model of FAVITES will extend superspreading events over timescales that within-host evolution can occur”. However, the simulations in Pekar et al., 2022, and in FAVITES more broadly, account for within-host evolution: the coalescent process and subsequent mutational evolution are agnostic to subsampling and within-host evolution. 2. In the second section, the authors describe how ascertainment biases and biased contact tracing could affect the recovered phylogeny. The core conceptual errors here are namely: The lineage A/B split and the basal polytomies of SARS-CoV-2 are still obvious in any phylogeny of early SARS-CoV-2 even when excluding genomes from the city of Wuhan: this phylogenetic structure is factually not an artifact of sampling, and anyone is welcome to build a tree of sequences before April 2020 excluding those from Wuhan and demonstrate this. Likewise, lineage A is still incompatible with the molecular clock when genomes linked to the Huanan Market are excluded. Even in sequences from February 2020 can you see a ‘lag’ in the evolution of lineage A from its root compared to lineage B (Pekar Fig S20). The authors propose no explanation of how contact tracing of patients connected to one market could produce a phylogenetic artifact of two large, basal polytomies: indeed, their simple analysis in Fig 2 shows that contact tracing will preferentially sample just one lineage, not two. Small polytomies are common throughout the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. A contact tracing bias cannot explain a lack of intermediate genomes between lineages A and B into itself. Firstly, if the evolution between the lineages occurred in humans, the patients with intermediate genomes should be contact traceable from normal lineage B patients. Second, even if they were missed in Wuhan, we would see the phylogenetic descendents of the intermediate genotype spread to other countries, unless this lineage just happened to be wiped out very quickly. As discussed by the Worobey et al. 2021 Science perspective, several of the earliest known SARS-CoV-2 patients were emphatically not contact traced from others — they were independently noticed in different hospitals throughout the city. This includes the earliest known case of lineage A, who was not contact traced, and had no noted connection to the Huanan Seafood Market, but after the fact was realized to live just a few blocks away (and shopped at a nearby market). Several other data points that together point towards the known early case data in Wuhan not being strongly characterized by ascertainment bias are discussed in the supplementary text of Worobey et al. 2022 Science section on this topic. 3. In the third section, the authors put forth the possibility that several sampled genomes were intermediate sequences of lineage A and lineage B. Again here, they both misunderstand the data that they are reporting on, and misconstrue the methods and findings of Pekar et al. They propose that a set of genomes obtained from Sichuan may constitute C/C intermediate haplotypes between lineages A and B. However, the data does not support this, as elegantly explained by Zach Hensel on Twitter: https://twitter.com/alchemy... https://twitter.com/alchemy... Washburne writes: ""It is difficult to see how sequencing errors, which are random, could occur at exactly the same position in these 12 early outbreak genomes."" However, what they do not understand is that several of these genomes were plagued by systematic bioinformatics errors, not random sequencing errors. This was likely due to a known issue with a pipeline that imputed the reference genotype in loci with no read support, instead of replacing those positions with N characters. As demonstrated by Hensel above, for this particular dataset with poor coverage, that included the vast majority of samples which had no coverage at the relevant sites. Further, the authors misunderstand why certain genomes have been excluded from Pekar et al. The deciding observation is not the quality of the underlying sequencing data — although that is certainly likely the hidden cause — but the observation that some genomes share multiple polymorphisms with derived lineages in A and B, strongly indicating that they are phylogenetically aberrant. In all scenarios in which underlying data are available, it has been confirmed that these phylogenetic outliers are plagued by poor data quality issues, with missing data that has often been incorrectly imputed. In cases without the underlying data, the only alternative explanation would have to be a highly unusual degree of recurrent mutations. As this is fully explained in Pekar et al. 2022, I highly suggest the authors attempt a re-read to understand the reasoning of how we can identify these incorrect genomes. There are two more “minor” (in the grand scheme of things) errors in this section: “Lineage A and Lineage B, are separated by only two defining single nucleotide changes (SNCs), at positions 8782 and 21844” This is incorrect - the second position should be 28144, not 21844. This is wrong throughout the manuscript. ""Intermediate sequences suggest there may not be two basal polytomies"" Polytomies can be separated by a single mutation and still be polytomies: there is a basal polytomy in lineage A, and a separate basal polytomy in lineage B. The existence of intermediate genomes would not preclude the presence of these two polytomies. In sum, neither of the three points raised by Washburne and colleagues are in fact relevant to the hypothesis of multiple spillovers of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, it is also important to briefly discuss a broader conceptual error made by the authors. As they write: ""Far from being able to conclude two spillover events, both hypotheses - natural origin and lab origin - are still on the table."" This quote (along with knowledge of their past works) makes evident the aim of the authors: to reject the possibility of multiple SARS-CoV-2 spillovers because it is a finding largely inconsistent with their preferred laboratory origin hypothesis. They are correct in thinking that multiple spillovers of SARS-CoV-2 cannot easily be explained by a hypothesis of laboratory emergence. They are, however, incorrect in their statement that a lack of evidence for multiple spillovers would “put the lab origin hypothesis on the table”. There is an astounding degree of evidence against the possibility of laboratory emergence, primarily: (1) the complete lack of epidemiological contacts traced to the WIV, and the March 2020 seronegativity of Shi Zhengli’s group, (2) the geographic epicenter of the pandemic was in Hankou, Wuhan, not Wuchang, where the WIV resides, (3) the detailed insight we have into the research ongoing at the WIV in 2018-2019, including CoV sequences submitted to GenBank in 2018 (Yu Ping et al.) and Latinne et al. 2020 (submitted Oct 6 2019), multiple publicly available theses and papers, interviews, collaborator emails, US intelligence investigations, and unfunded grant proposals: all of which has so far indicated a lack of a SARS-CoV-2 progenitor at WIV, (4) the preponderance of evidence from the known early cases within the city of Wuhan, which were either linked to or centered around the Huanan Seafood Market, including the very first cases first identified in hospitals as reported by independent journalists as described in Worobey 2021 Science perspective, (5) the positive viral samples from an animal cage, a freezer, a defeathering machine, and the drains and ground of wildlife selling stalls within the western half of the Huanan Seafood Market, the half to which most human cases were also linked, and (6) direct and geographic links of patients and environmental sampling firmly establishing that both early SARS-CoV-2 lineages A and B were first identified in connection to the Huanan Seafood Market. Put otherwise, it is clear that the authors misrepresent and misunderstand the reasons why multiple spillovers have been proposed. Contrary to their beliefs, it is not to undermine or reject the laboratory hypothesis. The clear evidence against that hypothesis is well described in Holmes et al. 2021 Cell, The WHO Mission Report, and Worobey et al. 2022 Science— it is entirely incidental that the likelihood of multiple spillovers also happens to be inconsistent with their hypothesis. Why then has the possibility of multiple spillovers been proposed? Because the genomic data from the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is *peculiar*, and these peculiarities have so far only been adequately explained by models incorporating multiple spillovers. It is as simple as that.",2022-10-16T16:15:13,acc_account,Alex Crits-Christoph,10.1101/2022.10.10.511625,Statistical challenges for inferring multiple SARS-CoV-2 spillovers with early outbreak phylodynamics,"Alex Washburne, Adrian Jones, Daoyu Zhang, Yuri Deigin, Steven Quay, Steven E Massey",2022-10-13

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.29.510055v1#comment-6012114750,biorxivstage,1,"Dr. Sarris, I am glad you have responded to the comments and are willing to discuss this topic further. I hope this will lead to better science and investigation into this phenomenon. If the goal was to attract attention with a provocative title and discussion, then you achieved this. Unfortunately the field of nitrogen fixation has a long history of claims of diazotorphy that have turned out to be false. So I hope you did not interpret my comments as doubting your expertise but more of a need for due diligence in a field with a bumpy history. I believe this manuscript and study need to be written in a way that will convince absolutely anyone with doubt. Therefore it does not hurt to be extremely specific when explaining the methods. For example, I commented on multiple-replatings because, as I read the methods, endophytes were isolated on nutrient agar and then directly plated on three different Glucose nitrogen-free media. Only on Page 4 line 23 do you describe “multiple generations” do you mean multiple transfers? If so, how many? And yes, I agree that if nitrogen contamination had been an issue, more of the isolates would have grown. I think this is important and should be stated in the manuscript. Again, to prove this phenomenon is real, I would suggest the most extreme caution and test with noble agar or agarose. It might also be helpful before this goes into an official review to repeat the growth on N-free media at a different facility just in case of contamination in water or other materials. Some bacteria can use ammonia from the air! So everything needs to be considered. ( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.j... For the N2 consumption assay, I think it would be communicated more clearly if the assay was reported in mol of N2/ min or hr/ mg of protein or colony-forming units to standardize and compare to other nitrogen-fixing organisms. Again, this will be doable without repeating the experiment if you have a standard curve. I am glad you measured the overall pressure change in each experiment, this should be stated in the methods. I think it might be beneficial to try with a majority argon atmosphere to see if a similar phenomenon occurs. It could test if the partial pressure of nitrogen affects the overall nitrogen fixation rate, suggesting if this is an enzymatic reaction with low Km. Also, a growth curve with nitrogen-free media in an argon atmosphere vs. N2 only atmosphere would be a compelling experiment. The comment that this dinitrogen consumption is occurring on ammonia-supplemented media might be a clue to what is happening. This is an exciting point that a constitutive process is consuming atmospheric dinitrogen in yeast. All known diazotrophs have a strict regulatory system to turn off nitrogen fixation when any fixed nitrogen is present. Therefore I believe it is essential to show the nitrogen-free assays as well. If you have the same nitrogen fixation rate in both ammonia-supplemented and nitrogen-free, this would be very interesting to determine what is limiting growth. All of these questions should be addressed in the manuscript. While we must think outside of prokaryotic nitrogen fixation, basic thermodynamics still apply. Therefore, no matter what, this reaction is highly energy intensive. From what I know, breaking the dinitrogen triple bond is the highest activation energy in biology. So I would fight back on the idea that this might not be a high energy-consuming process. This also brings questions to the previous observation of a constitutive reaction. In this topic, I also don’t want to discredit yeast and especially the peroxisomes. While I am no expert, I know some extreme chemistry goes on in peroxisomes, and the potential for dinitrogen to be oxidized to nitrite might be possible in them. Inorganic chemistry has shown oxidation of dinitrogen with a catalyst can happen, and we know life always finds a way! While I can easily google nitrogen fixation in yeast and get two papers from 1911 and 1954,  I can also easily google dozens of papers in he past 10 years that grow Saccharomyces cerevisiae under nitrogen limiting conditions. This is something you will have to justify in your manuscripts if you want to claim cerevisiae is using dinitrogen as its nitrogen source. For the PCR assay, I am just commenting on the gel itself and would hope to see a brighter band for the positive control. Also, it could be helpful once you get the Azotobacter strain to run nifH as another control to detect any prokaryotic diazotrophs. I hope to see you proceed with the N15 and the other controls. I would love to see a nitrogen-fixing eukaryote, but I am afraid it will require much more evidence for me to be convinced.

The results are really important specifically for rod-shaped bacteria and also an important contribution to the broader field of understanding cell shape. Specifically, I love that they are distinguishing between labile and non-labile intracellular magnesium pools, as well as extracellular magnesium! These three pools are really challenging to separate but I commend them on engaging with this topic and using it to provide alternative explanations for their observations! A major contribution to prior findings on the effects of magnesium is the author’s ability to visualize the number of septa in the elongating cells in the absence of magnesium. This is novel information and I think the field will benefit from the microscopy data shown here. I completely agree with the authors that we need to be more careful when using rich media such as LB. It is particularly sad that we may be missing really interesting biology because of that! It’s worth moving away from such media or at least being more careful about batch to batch variability. Batch to batch variability is not as well appreciated in microbiology as it is for growing other cell types (for example, mammalian cells and insect cells). For me, the most exciting finding was that a large part of the cell length changes within the first 10min after adding magnesium. The authors do speculate in the discussion that this is likely happening because of biophysical or enzymatic effects, and I hope they explore this further in the future! I love how the paper reads like a novel! Congratulations on a very well-written paper! Kudos to the authors for providing many alternative explanations for their results. It demonstrates critical thinking and an open-mind to finding the truth.

It would be helpful to have Western blot data showing that the particular proteins are actually being overexpressed. I think the phenotypes that you observe are very compelling, so I don’t doubt the conclusions. Western blot data would just provide some additional confirmation that you are actually achieving overexpression of UppS, MraY, and BcrC. Response The proteins are untagged. For the UppS and BcrC the cell shortening occurs with addition of inducer, , so strong indication expression is occurring. A western would provide information about degree of overexpression, but we don’t think is necessary to support conclusion drawn. Do you think there is an alternative possibility that needs to be excluded? We note that in another preprint ( https://www.biorxiv.org/con... the authors delete the native uppS in their inducible Phy-uppS strain (Fig S4) and at 100 uM IPTG (10X less than what we used in experiment) the cells have wt growth on LB plates, so we at least know the Phy-uppS is functional and made (or they would die!). We are introducing the uppS deletion into our strain to see if we can identify a concentration of IPTG that doesn’t affect cell growth but still induces shortening. For MraY, the result is negative, so you are spot on – it is impossible to tell if due to lack of overexpression from data shown. We only know the strain is correctly made from sequencing. We will investigate if there is an antibody or functional fusion available. The reason we were not sure was worth doing is because the MraY reaction is reversible (15131133). This means that without a phenotype, there is no simple way to know the reaction can even be pushed forward even if the overexpression is confirmed (more negative data). We actually overexpressed some other proteins that act downstream (MraY, MurJ, AmJ) and they were also negative for shortening. Probably we should remove the negative data or reword to make the caveats of the negative result clear. Question Based on your data, there are definitely differences in gene expression when you compare cells grown in media with and without magnesium. Because the majority in cell length increase occurs in such a short time though (the first 10min), I was wondering if you think that some or most of it is not due to gene expression? Response The shortening is even faster than 10 min (not only statistically significant, but also obvious qualitatively if we mount immediately after adding Mg2+ ). We did not include the first timepoint because original purpose was to check everything was ready with microscope – did not expect shortening so fast! We can definitely add that data in. When we saw, we tried to capture the transition on pads, but going from culture to pad seems to stress the cells too much in the small window where the cool stuff happens. Since growth rate doesn’t appear to be a big factor in those initial divisions, we might be able to grow at lower temp and shift to pads for adjustment period before adding Mg2+. Did not play with it much due to lack of resources atm, but a flowcell setup would probably be best. In short, we think rapid divisions right after transition do not require transcription or translation. It really “smells” more like a biophysical thing. Question Do you have any hypotheses what is most likely to be affected by magnesium? Do you think if the membrane may be affected? Response We have a lot of hypotheses – all of which are speculative. There could be an extracytoplasmic enzyme involved in envelope synthesis is sensitive to Mg2+ availability, and that at lower concentrations, it’s activity is affected. There is some old literature with membrane preps that suggests PG synthesis requires higher Mg2+ than teichoic acid synthesis. If Und-P is limiting, higher Mg2+ may shift make the pool more available to make the septum. Tingfeng initially hypothesized there might be a receptor/signal mechanism but has not been able to identify one. Und-P seems to be important, but “availability” is not just pool, but how fast (and where!) the flipping across the membrane occurs. If Und-PP needs to be dephosphorylated to Und-P before being flipped back to cytoplasmic side, anything that effects the PPi equilibrium would be predicted to affect the reaction rate, with lower Pi (in periplasm or pseudoperiplasm in case of G+) favoring the dephosphorylation. Cell wall associated Mg2+ could shift equilibrium to be more favorable for a Und-PP phosphatase more closely associated with the divisome. I could go all day… In short, we don’t know enough! Question Why do you think less magnesium activates this program of less division and more elongation? Additionally why is abundant magnesium activating a program of increased cell division and less elongation? Do you think there is some evolutionary advantage, especially considering how important magnesium is for ATP production? Response In the window we looked at, the elongation rate is constant (not less or more) and only the division frequency changes. Some bacteria (like Caulobacter and to lesser extent E. coli) clearly elongate and divide simultaneously, so there is some competition for substrate (like Lipid II). Septators like Bacillus seem to delineate the two processes more, but we have found conditions where even Bacillus invaginates during division, so it’s not absolute. Like eukaryotic cells, bacterial undoubtedly have mechanisms not only commit to a round of DNA replication when there is some signal that resources are sufficient. Clearly with some bugs, this is not the case with cell division. The alternative possibility is that every cell cycle there is an opportunity to divide if some threshold of *something(s)* is reached. There is a hypothesis from Mtb literature that it may be GTP, but it’s not at all clear that is sufficient. In yeast, size at cell division is affected by perturbing 1-C pool. Question Related to this previous question, I also wonder if this magnesium-dependent phenotype would extend to other unicellular organisms, may be protists or algae? That would be a really exciting direction to explore! Response It’s a great question – lots to do! We didn’t even look at another Gram-positive, but we plan to. It’s trickier to limit Mg2+ in Gram-negatives (see 27471053 – we tried Bsub homolog for those wondering – it’s not responsible for phenotype we see). Question Regarding the zinc and manganese experiments, why do you think they lead to additional phenotypes compared to magnesium? Do you have any hypotheses? Response We have hypotheses, but if my (Jen’s) twitter engagement is any indication, way too speculative for public consumption at present. Need grant to acquire preliminary data to write grant. Question Regarding your results that Lipid I availability may be a major a problem for the cell division in the absence of magnesium, do you think that is due to effects magnesium has on the enzymes directly, or do you think magnesium affects the substrate availability/conformation by coordinating the phosphate groups? Or something else, may be membrane conformation? Response Several proteins involved in envelope synthesis (like UppS) are Mg2+ dependent enzymes. But at least for any intracellular players, levels of Mg2+ should be more than high enough to support enzyme activity even when levels are low (0.8 – 3.0 mM is Bsub range I recall off top of head). Could have impact extracytoplasmically by lowering pool sponged into the cell wall, but intuition (for what that is worth) is that it is not the coordination of an enzyme with a metal that is impacted rather the equilibrium with other ions like Pi and H+ and that this impacts net ATP synthesis. Lots to think about and do, and no simple answers. When Tingfeng started project idea was to find mechanism – didn’t realize we were asking “how does the cell work?” Turned out to be a bit much for a dissertation project :) -Jen Herman and Tingfeng Guo",2022-10-13T19:16:01,bacillusbarosh,BacillusBaRosh,10.1101/2022.10.01.510448,Magnesium modulates Bacillus subtilis cell division frequency,"Tingfeng Guo, Jennifer K.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.500229v1#comment-6006954805,biorxivstage,0,"This paper aims to understand how toxin-antidote (TA) elements are spread and maintained in species, especially in species where outcrossing is infrequent and the selfish gene drive of TA elements is limited. The paper focuses on the possible fitness costs and benefits of the peel-1/zeel-1 element in the nematode C. elegans. A combination of mathematical modeling and experimental tests of fitness are presented. The authors make a surprising finding: the toxin gene peel-1 provides a fitness advantage to the host. This is a very interesting finding that challenges how we think about selfish genetic elements, demonstrating that they may not be wholly “selfish” in order to spread in a population. This paper is of interest to evolutionary biologists and population geneticists. It provides empirical evidence that supports a previous hypothesis of how selfish toxin-antidote elements spread in non-obligate outcrossing species. While the experiments and data are appropriate for addressing this hypothesis, one major conclusion is not supported by the data and one other major conclusion is supported only weakly. Strengths 1. The authors support results found with a zeel-1 peel-1 introgressed strain by using CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to precisely knock-out the genes of interest. They were careful to ensure the loss-of-function of these generated alleles by using genetic crosses. 2. Similarly, the authors are careful with controls, ensuring that genetic markers used in the fitness assays did not affect the fitness of the strain. This ensures that the genes of interest are causative for any source of fitness differences between strains, therefore making the data reliable and easily interpretable. 3. A powerful assay for directly measuring the relative fitness of two strains is used. 4. The authors support relative fitness data with direct measurements of fitness proximal traits such as body size (a proxy for growth rate) and fecundity, providing further support for the conclusion that peel-1 increases fitness. Weaknesses 1. One major conclusion is that peel-1 increases fitness independent of zeel-1, but this claim is not well supported by the data. The data presented show that the presence of zeel-1 does not provide a fitness benefit to a peel-1(null) worm. But the experiment does not test whether zeel-1 is required for the increased fitness conferred by the presence of peel-1. Ideally, one would test whether a zeel-1(null);peel-1(+) strain is as fit as a zeel-1(+);peel-1(+) strain, but this experiment may be infeasible since a zeel-1(null);peel-1(+) strain is inviable. 2. The CRISPR-generated peel-1 allele in the N2 background only accounts for 32% of the fitness difference of the introgressed strain. Thus, the effect of peel-1 alone on fitness appears to be rather small. Additionally, this effect of peel-1 shows only weak statistical significance (and see point 5 below). Given that this is the key experiment in the paper, the major conclusion of the paper that the presence of peel-1 provides a fitness benefit is supported only weakly. For example, it is possible that other mutations caused by off-target effects of CRISPR in this strain may contribute to its decreased fitness. It would be valuable to point out the caveats to this conclusion, or back it up more strongly with additional experiments such as rescuing the peel-1(null) fitness defect with a wild-type peel-1 allele or determining if introduction of wild-type peel-1 into the introgressed strain is sufficient to confer a fitness benefit. 3. The strain that introgresses the zeel-1 peel-1 region from CB4856 into the N2 background was made by a different lab. Given that N2 strains from different labs can vary considerably, it is unclear whether this introgressed strain is indeed isogenic to the N2 strain it is competed against, or whether other background mutations outside the introgressed region may contribute to the observed fitness differences. 4. Though the CRISPR-generated null allele of peel-1 only accounts for 32% of the fitness difference of the zeel-1 peel-1 introgressed strain, these two strains have very similar fecundity and growth rates. Thus, it is unclear why this mutant does not more fully account for the fitness differences. 5. Improper statistical tests are used. All comparisons use a t test, but this test is inappropriate when multiple comparisons are made. Importantly, correction for multiple comparisons may decrease the already weak statistical significance of the fitness costs of the peel-1 CRISPR allele (Fig 3E), which is the key result in the paper. 6. N2 fecundity and growth rate measurements from Fig 2B&C are reused in Fig 3C&D. This should be explicitly stated. It should also be stated whether all three strains (N2, the zeel-1 peel-1 introgressed strain, and the peel-1 CRISPR mutant) were assayed in parallel as they should be. If so, a statistical test that corrects for multiple comparisons should also be used. 7. It appears that the same data for the controls for the fitness experiments (i.e. N2 vs. marker & N2 vs. introgressed npr-1; glb-5) may be reused in Fig 2A and 3E. If so, this should be stated. It should also be stated whether all the experiments in these panels were performed in parallel. If so, this may affect the statistical significance when correcting for multiple comparisons. Minor points 1. Though the mathematical modeling is interesting from a theoretical point of view, we feel that it oversells the rationale behind the experiments, setting up a “straw man” argument to knock down. Also, the modeling relies on rather high assumptions of the possible carrying cost of peel-1/zeel-1. For example, the modeling of the effect of outcrossing rate on peel-1/zeel-1 frequency assumes a selection coefficient of 0.35, which seems rather arbitrary and high. Where does this number come from? Is there any precedence for this high carrying cost? In our opinion, the idea that energy expenditure or leaky toxicity accounts for such a high carrying cost seems unlikely. 2. The two studies cited for “outcrossing rates typical for C. elegans” estimated vastly different outcrossing rates (~20% or ~1%). The model presented in Fig S1 specifically uses the lower estimates (0-2%), so the Sivasundar & Hey paper is miscited here. It is unclear whether there is a good rationale to go with the lower rate estimates. 3. The measurement of body-size is unclear in the main text. Only when reading methods did we realize that body-size is more of a proxy for growth rate rather than an end-point measurement of worm size. 4. What is the temporal distribution of egg laying of the N2 and N2peel-1(null) strains? Based on how the data collection is described in the Methods, the authors should already have these data. Does egg-laying start at the same time in the two strains? The fact that strains carrying peel-1 grow faster but also apparently produce more sperm (which might slow them down) makes an analysis of this worthwhile, especially since fitness depends on when eggs are laid, not just how many. Some more characterization of this fitness trait seems appropriate and useful for beginning to understand how peel-1 may be increasing fitness. Given that the number of sperm limits how many eggs are laid, the presence of peel-1 apparently results in more sperm. It is surprising that a gene exclusively expressed in developing sperm can lead to production of more sperm. 5. Line 65: the statement “similar elements have not been identified in obligate outcrossing Caenorhabditis nematodes” is somewhat misleading. TA elements may not have been identified in obligate outcrossing nematodes because of research bias since genetic experiments are easier to perform in non-obligate outcrossers and it is unclear that there have been extensive searches for TA elements in outcrossing nematodes. Furthermore, as the mathematical models in this study suggest, TA elements will spread quickly with increasing rate of outcrossing. Since a TA element’s non-fixation within a species has historically been a prerequisite for its discovery, the rapid TA element fixation that would generally occur in obligate outcrossers would make their identification more challenging. 6. Line 209-210: it is stated that this is the “first measurement of the fitness cost of a TA element to the host” and “first demonstration that a TA element can benefit the organism.” These claims may be overstated. It has been previously shown in several cases that TA elements can provide fitness benefits in bacteria, such as improved antibiotic resistance (e.g. Bogati et al. 2022, PMID: 34570627). 7. More details about the CRISPR protocol would be helpful. It is unclear whether Cas9/sgRNAs were introduced as RNPs or plasmids (and at what concentrations). It is unclear how worms were screened for edits. It is also unclear how many Dpy or Rol worms were screened and how many peel-1 or zeel-1 edited worms were found (the efficiency of CRISPR). The meaning of the shaded portion of the repairing oligo sequences in the table is not explained. Finally, it is not stated whether CRISPR-generated mutant strains were outcrossed.

The preprint studied the conformational changes upon binding of the Akt protein kinase to the Akt active site inhibitor A-443654 and the Akt allosteric inhibitor MK-2206, under three states of Akt: inactive monophosphorylated, partially active tris-phosphorylated, and fully activated, tris-phosphorylated bound to PIP3 membranes. The MK-2206 resulted in allosteric conformational changes in all states and restricted membrane binding through sequestration of the PH domain. The A-443654 inhibitor led to allosteric conformational changes in the monophosphorylated and phosphorylated states, with increased protection in the PH domain upon membrane binding. The results can assist the design of Akt-targeted therapeutics.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.16.473032v2#comment-6005651228,biorxivstage,1,"This manuscript investigates the cellular basis of reduced insulin secretion in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) by generating several independent INS-1-derived cell lines to model PWS. These PWS model cells have reduced insulin secretion and reduced levels of insulin and several other secreted peptides. A possible mechanism is suggested by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, demonstrating the reduced expression of a number of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones that may be important for proper folding of insulin; reduced levels of chaperones may lead to reductions in insulin levels, though it should be emphasized that this is just a model and hasn’t been tested. The experiments are performed well and the data are solid and convincing, though the effect sizes are of rather small magnitude and it is unclear how important the small effects seen here are to the pathophysiology of PWS. The extensive and rigorous molecular characterization of the mutations in the PWS model cell lines is a particular strength, and the fact that several independent PWS and control cell lines are generated increases the confidence in the results. The proteomic and transcriptomic datasets generated in this work are important contributions to the field. We have a number of relatively minor critiques, many related to the writing and presentation of the work. Specific comments: 1.	Though the data appear to be solid, virtually all of the effects are of small magnitude, < 2 fold (e.g. insulin secretion, altered expression of chaperones at both the mRNA and protein levels, ER-stress sensitivity). This is fine, but is not readily apparent from the way the paper is written (e.g. line 389, where insulin secretion is described as “dramatically reduced” or elsewhere where effect sizes can only be gleaned by careful examination of the figures). More transparency and explicit discussion of the effect sizes would be helpful. For instance, it would be helpful to compare the effect sizes seen here to those of PWS mouse models and human patients. 2.	The take-home model of the paper is that the effect on insulin in PWS is due to an indirect effect on chaperones. This is a reasonable and interesting model, but given that the magnitude of the downregulation of these chaperones is actually quite small (appears to be less than 2-fold for most or all of them), it seems possible that some other mechanism is at play and this may be a red herring. It is unclear whether such a modest decrease in multiple chaperones would produce the observed effects on insulin content and secretion, though it is an interesting question for future work. However, it would also be nice to see the full lists of proteomic data presented as supplementary tables for interested readers so possible alternative targets can be more easily explored. 3.	It is concluded that PWS cells are unable to compensate for decreases in chaperones because many chaperones are simultaneously downregulated. This argument does not make a lot of sense to us, and would seem to depend on the mechanism of compensation, which is not further described here. For example, if chaperone genes are transcriptionally downregulated in PWS mutants, what precludes an independent compensation mechanism from simply turning transcription back up, unless the PWS genes are important for the compensation process itself? It would help to present more about what is known about this compensation mechanism, and whether it occurs transcriptionally or posttranscriptionally. A small decrease in many chaperones does not inherently seem to preclude a possible compensation mechanism. 4.	The paper is rather difficult to read with lots of jargon and a poor narrative flow. The reader has to do a lot of work to figure things out on their own without much help. Several examples of this are provided in the next few comments(#5-8). 5.	Some genes or proteins come up quite suddenly without mentioning their functions or significance. For example, in lines 85-90, SNRPN, SNORD116 and SNORD107 have not been introduced yet as PWS genes, which makes the subsequent conclusion confusing that PWS genes function in beta cells. 6.	In several places in the proteomics and transcriptomics sections, there are long lists of genes or proteins with very little context to orient the reader. It is hard for the reader to make much of these lists, and some guidance as to why they are considered worth pointing out or short take-home messages in these sections would be useful. 7.	The description of engineering PWS INS-1 cells is quite hard to follow. Figure 1B is not very intuitive.  These sections demanded a lot of work from the reader, much of which required looking at supplementary figures to understand the main Results sections. As many readers may not look at these figures, it would help to make this section more accessible. 8.	The rationale for performing RNA-seq of small RNAs is not provided. This section ends up interrupting the main narrative and feeling tangential. 9.	Since PWS cells have altered levels of many proteins, it is unclear whether the total protein content is a good parameter to use for normalization of insulin secretion. 10.	It would help to see the unnormalized raw data for the insulin secretion experiments. Figure 2 shows pooled data from several cell lines. It would also be helpful to see the data for each line separately in a supplementary figure. 11.	It is not stated how many times proteomic and transcriptomic experiments were replicated. It is stated that each was performed on three control and three PWS cell lines, but it is unclear if each line was tested just once. It seems likely that the data depicted in the figures are pooled from the different lines though this is not stated explicitly. More clarity on these points would be useful. Separate figures for unpooled data of each cell line would also be useful in the Supplement so that variability between lines can be seen. 12.	The study emphasizes the deficits in secreted peptides and ER chaperones but doesn’t provide an explanation for proteins that are increased. A number of neuronal active zone proteins are reported to have increased expression at the mRNA level, but for most it is unclear whether this effect extends to the protein level (only CHGB is labeled in Figure 3). The possible relevance of these changes is also unclear. It is pointed out that many of these proteins may play a role in insulin secretion, but it is unclear why potentially increased levels would lead to the decreased secretion observed in PWS cells unless these factors are negative regulators of insulin secretion (though that seems unlikely given their neuronal functions). Thus, the relevance of these results is unclear. 13.	It would be helpful to explicitly state in the Results how many of the genes with reported changes in RNA levels were validated and were not validated by RT-PCR experiments. 14.	It is unclear whether it is standard practice to use an anti-KDEL antibody in Western blots to specifically identify GRP94 and GRP78, given that this antibody would be expected to recognize many proteins. If so, it would be helpful to cite other articles that validate this method or state the same thing. 15.	Electron microscopy images in Fig S17 show one picture of each cell line, leading to the conclusion that PWS cells have normal ultrastructure. It is unclear what criteria were used to make this apparently subjective conclusion (no quantitative data are presented). Also, there is no mention of how many cells and sections were examined. 16.

This is a way we can help science to go forward. And this is why we decided to publish our manuscript as a preprint, in order to have such a communication with the community (since we are not a N2-fixation group). Please find below a point-by-point answer on your comments. The title is indeed intriguing, however, it describes a really interesting and fascinating new phenomenon, and I am sure that you and several other colleagues wouldn't deal or discuss these findings if the title was not so ""provocative"". I can understand your concerns on something totally new, however, I cannot understand where did you extracted the information that we did not do “multiple re-plating to remove residual nitrogen within the cell”. Please remember that from a single microbial cell for being produced a visible colony on a plate needs hundreds cell cycles. Do you believe that remnants of nitrogen could support this? Regarding your comment “…media and agar with residual nitrogen”. If you carefully read our manuscript, you will understand that we screened >600 endophytic microbial isolates in this experiment. If the media and agar had residual nitrogen we would have also seen growth on a number of unrelated microbes. However, this was not the case in our experiments. Thank you for your suggestion on the pure agar. We did exactly what has been extensively published in the literature, using the protocols described in all these publications. On the other hand, we are a 20 years molecular and diagnostic microbiology Lab and of course we use pure agar (any residues would be a problem for us in any microbial identification). As a confirmation for this please see my comment on the 600 isolates screening in this work. Thank you for your comment on Mo and Fe. If you carefully read our manuscript, you will see that we describe agar plates (Suppl. Fig. 6) and not liquid media. Of course yeasts need Fe and this is the reason why they grow slowly and are stressed as we clearly describe in our manuscript. Your suggestion about the positive control is an excellent suggestion, thanks! Based on the contact with the community we had through this preprint, we now have already started a collaboration with a lab in USA and the Azotobacter vinelandii strain DJ and a ΔnifD mutant are on the way to Crete. Your question about the N2 consumption in a normal atmosphere is something that worried us, too. For this, we were measuring the pressure in every vial at the end of each experiment (no significant changes in pressure were detected), and of course we used the crimper in each assay for all vials. Indeed, the O2 is consumed, however other gas by-products are produced in the vial keeping the pressure stable or with minor changes. We observed the same N2-consumption in O2-rich conditions (respiration), as well as, in O2-free conditions (fermentation), so we did not “measure the change in partial pressure after the consumption of O2 in the vial” as you mention. I would like to mention that Prof. Kotzabasis (co-author) is a ~30 years’ expert on analytical methods like GC-TCD. Your suggestion for 15N gas enrichment is already discussed and agreed with our collaborator in USA (we are not experts on this assay). Regarding the ammonia measurement: If you carefully read our manuscript, you will find information regarding a publication where the authors describe the production of NH4+ when yeasts are grown in Raffinose–NFYM (N2-free yeast medium), Raffinose–NFMM (N2-free mineral medium) and Mannitol–NFMM, so this is already published. For the first draft of our preprint we decided not to repeat these assays, however, we have just received the related kit for repeating them. Regarding your comment “…GC dinitrogen consumption assays…”: This is the surprising point of our discovery! We observed that this biological phenomenon seems to be active in various cultivation conditions (pοοr or rich media; presence or absence of O2, etc.). Of course we have also measured this phenomenon on N2-free liquid media. However, since it also occurs in YPD, I cannot understand why not to use it. Regarding your question on “why would yeast be fixing large amounts of nitrogen when it's freely available?” I have to say I don’t know! However, I would suggest to stop thinking on this phenomenon like we think on the prokaryotic N2-fixation. We don’t know what the mechanism is or if it is less energetic, etc. On the other hand even in prokaryotic N2-fixation organisms, the phenomenon is not so energy consuming as it was initially believed, so it can run in parallel to respiration. But, at the moment we can only speculate... Please google “nitrogen fixation by yeast”, you will be surprised. Like you, we also did not have an idea about the very old observation/claim that some yeast and fungi can grow using atmospheric N2… However, when we initially observed this phenomenon in my lab, we started looking for evidence in the literature and we found some very old literature (e.g. Nitrogen Fixation by Soil Yeasts, Nature, 1954. Nitrogen Fixation by yeasts and other fungi, Nature, 1911, etc.). Apart of these very old reports nobody else has ever investigated the ability of yeast to grow without nitrogen sources this is why no one has seen this in the past. The calibration for the quantification of N2 and O2 volume, has been done by the company provided and maintaining our GC-TCD equipment, by injecting known quantities in the GC-TCD (N2: r2=0,9983; O2: r2=0,9953). As I mentioned before Prof. Kotzabasis (co-author) is a ~30 years’ expert on analytical methods like GC-TCD. The PCR assay has been performed following a treatment with a cocktail of 6 antibiotics and multiple re-cultivations in antibiotic containing media… please be sure that no bacteria could survive this treatment. The protocol for the elimination of bacterial endophytes has been extensively used and has been published in the literature. The 16S primers that we used are common and have been used extensively by a great number of Labs around the globe. When you say “the small amount of growth seen on plates” I am wondering if you have carefully seen the growth in our Fig 1. I will remind you here (as I have mentioned above) that other groups have also observed this phenomenon in the past, however, without proceeding to its analysis. As a conclusion of this text exchange, I would keep your very helpful suggestion on a positive control in GC-TCD assays, as well as, your suggestion on 15N measurement.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.12.464130v2#comment-6004434714,biorxivstage,1,"A few concerns have been raised about this manuscript that we wish to address specifically here as well as in a second version of this preprint. Concern 1: We report a large number of eccDNA breakpoints in our samples in this manuscript. This large number and diversity of eccDNAs could be the result of contaminating linear DNA. This contaminating linear could call into question our results. In general, our pipeline could be calling other artefacts as eccDNAs, and has not been as thoroughly vetted as other previously published pipelines. Our response: •	We have performed a thorough degradation of linear DNA in all our samples which follows the standards set by our colleagues in the field. We also verified this degradation using qPCR. •	We provide two PCR experiments that support our claims of little to no linear DNA contamination in our samples. •	We used split reads and discordant reads to identify eccDNA forming regions. Any remaining linear DNA that was directly sequenced would not result in either of these read variants and would therefore not result in calls by our pipeline. We verified this by running our pipeline on whole genome sequencing data from other studies. •	While the phi29 polymerase prefers to amplify circular DNA, contaminating linear DNA may also be amplified, resulting in multimeric sequences that, when sequenced, result in split reads and therefore eccDNA calls by our pipeline. This is an accepted weakness of this protocol in the field. However, this method is still widely used by our colleagues, pointing to the fact that this weakness is not enough to invalidate the analysis of eccDNA sequencing data. Clearly, the preference of the phi29 polymerase for circular DNA is strong enough to allow meaningful analysis. All of the data we re-analyzed in this study used the phi29 amplification protocol and therefore would have been similarly affected by linear DNA contamination, but these samples did not show the abundance of eccDNAs we saw in M. oryzae. •	We sequenced O. sativa samples in addition to our M. oryzae samples to verify that our lab methods were not the source of our observations in M. oryzae. Our sequenced O. sativa samples appeared very similar to the samples produced by a previous study across many characteristics and looked very different from what we saw in M. oryzae. Specifically, the number of eccDNAs identified in those samples were much smaller than in M. oryzae. •	We compared our called eccDNA forming regions to those called using the same sequencing data by a previous study (Møller et al. 2018) and found that our results were largely similar, and our criteria for eccDNA calling was more stringent than those previously published. •	Other previously published pipelines, like ecc_finder, use peaks of sequencing reads in the genome as the primary basis for identifying eccDNAs in the genome. However, given the large diversity of eccDNAs we found in M. oryzae we were unable to rely on a peak calling based approach for our data, and instead wrote our own pipeline that relies entirely on split-mapping reads and opposite facing read pairs which are strong evidence of eccDNAs, and used in conjunction with peak-calling in other pipelines. •	We also compared our Illumina called eccDNAs to eccDNAs called using PacBio data in the same samples. This data is much easier to interpret as long split reads are clear evidence of eccDNA formation. We found substantial overlap between eccDNAs called using our Illumina data and using our PacBio data. Concern 2: We report very little overlap in eccDNA breakpoints between samples, especially among technical replicates, which calls into question the results, especially when it comes to the relevance of genes being found on eccDNAs. This little overlap, combined with potential linear DNA contamination, could point to this study simply over-analyzing noisy data without biological significance. While we explain this lack of overlap by pointing, in part, to under-sequencing, we also claim that this cannot be the reason a subset of genes are never present on eccDNAs in our data which seems contradictory. Our response: •	The number of eccDNA forming regions we identified in each of our technical replicates suggests that each sample contained an extremely large number of distinct eccDNA molecules. Our analysis of split read counts per eccDNA showed that the majority of these eccDNA molecules were very likely present at very low copy numbers. Furthermore, replication of individual eccDNA molecules in M. oryzae is likely to be very rare or non-existent. •	We split our technical replicates after DNA extraction. Given the hugely diverse population of low copy number eccDNAs in each of these samples, it is extremely likely that some eccDNAs ended up in one aliquot and not the others. This likely explains the lack of overlap in exact breakpoints between technical replicates. •	We also showed that increasing our sequencing coverage per technical replicate likely would have led to better overlap between technical replicates. However, this likely would not have completely solved the problem given the low copy number of the eccDNAs. •	Given the little overlap in breakpoints between samples, we instead sought to analyze the hotspots and coldspots for eccDNA formation in the genome. We felt that this analysis was meaningful because, while our technical replicates did not share exact breakpoints, they did share many approximate breakpoints (if we allow boundaries to be within 100 bp of each other, for example) pointing to the existence of these hotspots. We compared this overlap in breakpoints to our expected overlap if we had sequenced random segments of the genome in each sample and found no such overlap. •	We chose to focus on these hotspots and coldspots by taking a gene-based perspective and counting how often M. oryzae genes were fully contained within eccDNAs in our data, regardless of the exact breakpoints of the eccDNAs. This helped us identify a group of genes that we never found fully contained within an eccDNA in any of our samples. In this case, we were able to show, through rarefaction and permutation analyses, that we do not expect that increasing our sequencing coverage would have led to the discovery of all of these genes in our samples. We used this analysis as evidence that, while under sequencing may have affected our ability to detect overlap in exact breakpoints between samples, it did not explain this observation.",2022-10-05T17:10:51,pmjoubert,Pierre Joubert,10.1101/2021.10.12.464130,"The extrachromosomal circular DNAs of the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae contain a wide variety of LTR retrotransposons, genes, and effectors","Pierre M.

Review synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. In this preprint Munhoz et al. identify adiponectin as the main effector of the protective effects of sera from lean women and calorie-restricted rats on beta-cell integrity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The study reports that sera from obese humans and rats impairs beta-cell integrity and insulin secretion in the absence of nutrient overload. This observation implies that changes in circulating factors between obese and lean individuals would explain the effects on beta-cell function. The levels of circulating adiponectin in rat sera and human plasma were consistent with the metabolic effects observed in beta-cells. Finally, adding adiponectin to islet cultures that were incubated with sera from obese individuals restored beta-cell integrity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The data are reported in a clear way and the manuscript is well written. Data are consistent with a role of adiponectin in the observed protective effects, but some additional experiments are suggested to clarify this role. Major comments The paper states that adiponectin is necessary to maintain islet function and integrity. According to the data reported, it is recommended to amend the conclusions to indicate that adiponectin is “sufficient”. A key experiment to demonstrate that adiponectin  is necessary would be to deplete the sera of adiponectin and then evaluate the same parameters on beta-cells/islet primary culture. Adiponectin-receptor KO beta-cells would also help to clarify the role of adiponectin in the protective effects of sera. It may also be worth exploring if there were other hormones or other components beyond adiponectin which may have the similar increase in serum samples. In Figure 3A/3B, a picture of the corresponding Ponceau used for quantification should be shown next to the adiponectin blot. It would also be helpful to provide the full raw blots as supplementary files to allow for further evaluation, e.g. there seems to be a faint band in 3A above the predicted band which might be cropped in 3B, and there seems to be some difference in protein migration in different samples. Please show as a supplementary figure the full blot for adiponectin with all the samples shown in quantification. In the blot in Figure 3B there does not appear to be a clear difference between adiponectin levels in lean vs obese women, which would argue against adiponectin having a beneficial metabolic effect when treating beta-cells. It would be useful to provide some further comments on this possible discrepancy. Figure 4E compares different amounts of glucose with either FBS or no serum+adiponectin. Another condition with only no serum + vehicle for adiponectin should be included as a negative control, as shown in Figure 5. Minor comments Abstract - Please specify in which model (cell/islet culture) the effects are observed. Sex-specific differences - The findings in humans are really interesting. However, only male rats are reported in this manuscript. Would there be any difference between male and female CR-rats sera when applied to beta-cells? This experiment would be a great addition to the paper. If the experiment cannot be completed at this time, there should be a mention to this limitation in the discussion. Results ‘ Fig. 1A shows that the animals on the CR diet gained significantly less weight over the course of 15 weeks, but did not lose mass’ - This text refers to mass, the figure legend says weight, the y axis title on the figure states body mass. Please clarify for consistency. Results  ‘ They were within the same age range (Table 1), but were clearly distinct in body mass indexes (BMI), which separated them into lean and obese groups: lean women (BMI 22 ± 0.9, Fig. 2B) ’ - Please clarify the reference to Figure 2B in this fragment as the figure does not report BMI. Results ‘ these results show a clear modulatory effect of circulating blood factors on metabolic fluxes in β-cells, which are stimulated by factors present in samples from lean and female subjects. ’ - It is interesting that this is only observed for females, does this suggest that there may be sex-related factors involved, instead of or in addition to diet status? Could some further comment be added as to why the effect may only be observed in females. Please mention in the abstract/discussion that the results are obtained from in vitro experiments using beta-cells and islet primary cultures. Conclusions: suggest specifying  “in the blood of lean rats ” in the fragment that states “... in the blood of lean animals ”.
