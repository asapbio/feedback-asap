Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) is a widely used animal model for understanding the pathogenesis of its’ human counterpart, Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). To initiate a productive infection the virus must first gain access to a host cell. MCMV has various glycoproteins on its surface that interact with specific host cellular receptors depending on cell type. It was recently shown that Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) is important for MCMV entry into a variety of cell types. Depending on the cell type MCMV utilizes different viral glycoproteins to attach and enter host cells. In fibroblasts, viral entry favors the utilization of viral glycoproteins gB in conjunction with gH/gL/gO known as the trimer. In endothelial, epithelial or myeloid cells, viral entry occurs through the use of gB, the trimer and another complex made up of gH/gL/gO/Mck2 which is known as the pentamer. Mck2 or mouse chemokine 2, has dual functionality in both viral entry and chemokine function. Currently it has not been elucidated the host cellular receptor that Mck2 utilizes for entry into host cells. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 screen, this study identifies the MHC-I molecule is implicated in MCK2 dependent entry into macrophages. Positive feedback. I felt that the way the paper is organized was logical and easy to follow. The color coding of the different viruses helped to follow along in the graphs. In the in vivo experiments, utilizing both plaque assays and fluorescence levels to confirm results made them more convincing. The restoration of the phenotype by complementation of B2m and CD81 made the results more convincing. Utilizing the two different viruses that either have or lack MCK2 definitely strengthens their argument.  In examining the B2m relationship with Mck2, performing the experiments both in primary cells and immortalized cells strengthens the argument. Using different virus strains that have different genetic manipulations of MCK2, is beneficial for showing that the phenotype is due to a defective protein and not just that specific mutation of the protein in that virus strain. Major Concerns Given that most of the initial experiments are done in cell culture, I would have expected there to be more replicates. Also why there are different numbers of replicates used between the different virus groups? Characterizing stromal cells as anything not Cd11c positive is a reach. The lack of substantial infectivity of these viruses, regardless of the presence of MCK2, in most of these cell lines makes the data hard to believe I wonder if the current in vivo data can truly tell if lack of H-2 molecules impacts dissemination. Alternatively, it could impact the rate of virus growth in the SG or in other tissues. To truly understand whether dissemination is impacted one must use barcoded viruses. Minor concerns While infectivity using these reporter viruses has been assessed by flow cytometry previously, I think that performing a plaque assay would further validate results. List the actual p values instead of using the star annotation Minor spelling errors (pg. 25 the strain C57BL/6 is spelled incorrectly) For Figure 4 C-E, it would be helpful to make the scales on each of the graphs the same to be able to compare between all three graphs. For Figure 5D, it would be beneficial to show the isotype control in the same panel as the MHC-1 to confirm increase/decrease of expression For those not in the field, I felt that there was not enough emphasis on what type of cellular entry MCK2 functions in, which would help the reader get a more complete understanding of the results. For figure 7, it would be more convincing that the viruses lacking MCK2 are in stromal cells if there was a specific marker used for stromal cells For figure 3C, it is a little unclear what the middle column is demonstrating if it is either a locus or reference sequence. This could be easily clarified in the figure legend or materials/methods section. In page 5 of the results, when talking about the defective MCK2 and how it was repaired, it would be helpful to make it more clear to the reader for how it was defective and how it was repaired. Why was the viral load in SG measured at day 7? What if a later time point (e.g., day 14) viral load is the same for two types of the viruses? This needs to be checked. Which specific H-2 molecules (L,D,K) are important for infection? This could be an interesting point of discussion. b2M-deficient mice may have weird NK cell response that could play a role in control of MCMV. Can the authors confirm that NK cells were not involved in viral control in these mice? In experiments even with MOI=1 infection rate is very low, <20%. Why? Would waiting for longer time to detect infected cells allow detecting all cells as infected?",2023-04-05T15:39:35,,UTK Micro Immunology JC,10.1101/2022.10.05.510922,MHC class Ia molecules facilitate MCK2-dependent MCMV infection of macrophages and virus dissemination to the salivary gland,"Berislav Bošnjak, Elisa Henze, Yvonne Lueder, Kim Thi Hoang Do, Alaleh Rezalofti, Christiane Ritter, Anja Schimrock, Stefanie Willenzon, Hristo Georgiev, Lea Fritz, Melanie Galla, Karen Wagner, Martin Messerle, Reinhold Förster",2022-10-07

Though much focus is centered on thin-film freezing and nanotechnology, why has metabolism of niclosamide by cytochrome P450  CYP1A2 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A1 drawn so little attention? Is it possible after the gut metabolizes niclosamide, what little remains fortuitously interacts with the tape worm but is rendered barely absorbable systemically?  Consider what might be gained if this drug’s p.o. administration was preceded by - or combined - with known CYP/UGT inhibitors such as fluvoxamine, cimetidine, melatonin, ciprofloxacin, acetacin and kaempferol.  Could a more therapeutic blood level be attained? Approaching this dilemma from a different direction, might niclosamide be delivered via suppository, with an increase in its bioavailability?  Many drugs with similar insolubility and molecular weight are already administered rectally with resulting serum levels as effective as pills or capsules.  The distal rectal mucosa, richly vascularized by the inferior and middle veins, connects directly to the systemic circulation.  Its more proximal superior rectal vein, however, connects to the portal system, making this distal two-thirds the optimal surface area for uptake while bypassing UGT/CYP enzymes.",2023-04-04T21:43:10,EdSoBronx40thPct,Ed Phillips,10.1101/2022.07.19.500639,Orally administered niclosamide-based organic/inorganic hybrid suppresses SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Geun-woo Jin, Goeun Choi, N.

We know that central tolerance – removal of T cells specific to self antigens – is not 100% efficient and some self-reactive T cells do accumulate in the periphery. This leaky process is likely responsible for some autoimmune reaction observed in humans. However, how such self-reactive T cells are activated remains poorly defined. The authors developed an interesting system where they have T cells recognizing a specific antigen that was engineered to be expressed in lung epithelial cells (OVA + 2W + gp66). By using the antigen with several epitopes this allows to investigate how T cell response to one of these epitopes impacts endogenous immune response to other epitopes. Interestingly, authors found that transfer of T cells specific to gp66 epitope into mice does not result in inflammatory response to 2W epitope by endogenous, 2W-specific CD4 T cells. Instead, the authors observed expansion of 2W-specific Tregs. Response was different in the lymph vs. lung. Interestingly, after primary response, immunization with 2W peptide with an adjuvant did not result in expansion of conventional, 2W-specific T cells indicating induction of tolerance. Expansion of 2W-specific Tregs was also observed by intranasal inoculation of LPS into mice. Overall, this study provides an interesting view on how ongoing immune response may influence response of self-specific CD4 T cells. Positive feedback. There are a lot of interesting things about this paper. First, the system to have lung-restricted antigen that has several well defined epitopes is highly innovative. The methodology to accurately count the number of naive T cells in the whole mouse (we talk about 10-100 cells per mouse!) is impressive. Looking at endogenous response, without transfer of monoclonal TCR-Tg T cells is really fundamental. The way how authors look at two tissues - lymphoid (lymph nodes) and lung - is important. The use of LPS injection as a model for lung injury is interesting as it also allows to look at actual pathology (mouse weight) as a medically relevant read-out. The text is short (perhaps in some places too short, see below for comments) and figures are relatively clear (see comments). Having an experimental layout for how the mice were treated, along with what was harvested for each experiment was very useful. Finally, having many different lines of mice is very impressive! Major Concerns I do not understand how transfer of naive T cells results in pathology in the lung (Fig 1 results). Per basics of immunology, 3 signals are needed to activate T cells - i.e., there is a need of inflammation to induce immune response and trafficking to the lung. Perhaps activated T cells were transferred but that was not clear from experimental design in Fig 1. Authors must provide better rationale of how transfer of naive T cells causes IgM in BAL to increase. Tracking immune response of transferred cells (e.g., activation markers, division history by CFSE, cell numbers in LNs/spleen over time) would be needed. Also, it would be very important to perform titration experiments to show how the number of transferred T cells impacts pathology. Similarly, why day 7 was chosen as the point to measure the endogenous response was not clear. While measurements of T cells in lymph nodes and spleen are typically efficient (most cells are recovered), isolation of activated T cells from nonlymphoid tissues, especially the lung is highly inefficient and may be biased (some subsets could be better isolated than others, PMID: 25957682). Confirming the results of Treg bias in lung samples must be done with using microscopy. Furthermore, when T cells are isolated from tissues due to contamination with the blood, cells in the circulation may be detected as in the parenchyma (24385150). Experiments must be repeated to include intravascular staining to separate cells in the blood vs. parenchyma to indicate that Tregs in the lung are in fact in the lung. I found it weird that the authors claim that 2W-specific Tregs are responsible for suppression of endogenous responses to 2W upon antigen+adjuvant injection and yet, depletion of Tregs did not result in a new response. A simpler interpretation is induction of anergy in endogenous T cells upon exposure to Ag in the absence of strong inflammation. Text must be carefully curated to avoid bias towards one favorite explanation. Focus on SLOs and lung is clear but I wonder if using another control peripheral tissue that did not express the antigen could be useful. For example, measuring T cell accumulation in the liver may be a useful control. It was not clear if  expression of OVA is actually restricted to the lung. Perhaps some more thorough analysis of other tissues would be helpful to verify the absence of leakiness of the gene expression. Minor concerns Having numbers for lines in the paper could allow for better referencing to specific statements made in the paper. While for most immunologists Tregs are FoxP3, some younger researchers may not know this. Mentioning that this is how you define Tregs would be useful. Also, assessing the function of these T cells would be useful. Please do not use “ns” or “**” to denote statistical significance. Use actual p values, e.g., p=0.34 or p=0.012. Additionally, indicating fold difference between groups (effect size) could be also useful. In introduction: Whether autoimmune responses are driven by naive T cells or by cross-reactive memory T cells is unclear. Cross-reactivity may be a simpler explanation given that memory T cells may require lower thresholds for activation. Authors should describe better different epitopes used in the construct, e.g., gp66 is from LCMV. Why did authors use gp66-specific CD4 T cells and not OVA-specific OTII cells? Are the results the same is using T cells of a different specificity? Are the detected Tregs derived from the thymus or are these “converted” naive T cells to the Treg phenotype? I don’t think that the current data allow to discriminate between these alternatives. When indicating difference in expansion in the Results section, please indicate how much (how many fold) is that expansion. How is the lung injury by LPS dependent on the LPS dose? Perhaps this needs to be discussed. I wonder that measuring kinetics of response, e.g., before day 7 and after, may be useful. We know that exposure to self antigens typically results in deletion of naive CD8 T cells (10843383) Which specific LNs were isolated? This probably should be listed in materials and methods section. I wonder if plotting some data as paired (e.g., Fig 1 - 2W vs. SMARTA) could reveal some additional information. How were Tr1 cells gated? Some flow cytometry graphs may be useful here (Suppl Fig S2) Suppl Fig 3 would benefit from experimental design panel.",2023-04-01T23:15:29,vitalyvganusov,Vitaly V.

I am a bit confused by the approach for neighborhood definition: if I understand correctly you search for the w vector with the maximum absolute correlation with ∆g, and then you sort the cells along w. But why not instead just sort the cells according to ∆g? 2. If I understand correctly, the neighborhood is strongly driven by the two cells that define the v to which the selected w corresponds. Have you tested the robustness of the results to this choice? How would you go about testing that? For example, what happens if you remove all cells that belong to  the neighborhood defined for g and then run the process again? Are there no DEGs? Or maybe you can find a different neighborhood that represent cells that are affected by the contrasting variable in a different way as compared to the cells in the original neighborhood. 3. According to your understanding/experience what happens in cases where for a specific gene g and a specific contrast, there are two cell populations for which there is differential expression population A includes cells for which the expression increases by a lot and population B includes cells for which the expression increases by a little? What about if the signs are opposite (i.e. expression increases for population A and decreases for population B)? To clarify, when I say population, I am thinking of some cell type/state. 4. I think it would be helpful to explicitly define what does ∆gQg represents. I assume it is the submatrix of ∆ that includes the row corresponding to g and columns representing cells in Q, but (assuming I got it right) in my opinion it would help to be explicit. 5. I think it would be interesting to see the cumulative Z-score curves for a collection of genes (representing neighborhood of a variety of sizes). What is the expectation in terms of the shape of these curves? Are there outlier cases? Is this something that could be used to identify cases in which the defined neighborhood may be suboptimal? 6. More generally I think the paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of approaches to examine the results and identify cases in which the embedding in general and/or specific neighborhoods may be suboptimal.

We have some recommendations to make the manuscript clearer and some questions, which we’d be grateful if you could answer. The results include a wide range of tissues from mice, rats, and humans. At times, it is difficult to follow how many samples (independent people/animals) were used and which data corresponds to which specific sample, this is an issue given that some data are from tissues known to have higher/lower HCD contents e.g., old vs young participants, TI vs TII dominant muscle fibres, and healthy vs diseased populations. As the focus is on characterising HCD content, the exact source used to determine that content is important. For example, human heart values are from patients undergoing heart surgery, it is not clear what pathology these participants had and how that could affect HCD content, or whether contents would differ in compartments other than the right atrial appendage; human adipose tissue are combined values from lean, and obese people undergoing surgery; liver samples are from people with obesity undergoing gastric bypass surgery, it is possible that they also have other pathologies (e.g., NAFLD) here; and kidney samples are from cancer patients undergoing nephropathy, while you mention that tissue was sampled away from the tumor (in cases of cancer), it is possible that the metabolic changes (pH and glycolytic flux) influenced the tissue HCD contents, and it should be clear this values may not represent healthy human kidney values. All participants should be described in full, especially for factors that are known to influence HCD content (sex, age, BMI, disease state/pathology etc.). As well as this, the beta-alanine supplementation dose needs to be made clear, as this will influence tissue and circulating contents. This additional information could either be fully described in the figure legend, or perhaps with a summary table that contains the various populations, characteristics, and the figure that the data corresponds to. Interpretation and conclusions should also reflect the participant characteristics e.g., HCD concentrations reflect tissue from X, Y, Z pathology or population, rather than assuming these are representative of healthy human values. There is a really interesting finding that using a CARNS1 KO tissue matrix leads to much lower HCD estimations than using water. This has implications for all prior HCD content research, and potentially means we need to correct prior estimations for measurement error. An example of this are the data in Fig 1F, where skeletal muscle concentrations are approx. 2 mM w/w, which is substantially lower than prior research, including the current authors own HMRS data. It would be great for the authors to expand on this, explain the method in detail and the importance of using a CARNS1 KO tissue matrix, and how this should influence future work. The line numbers below correspond to the original version of the paper (which has since been updated with a newer version). Some descriptors in the text appear to overstate the corresponding data e.g., lines 89-90 ‘HCD levels were overestimated by 2-3-fold’ – this is true for the rat CNS data, but the human muscle data difference is an approx. 90% increase. Line 124 also states ‘2-fold higher CARNS1 mRNA’ – but the actual difference here is approx. 60-65%. Line 168 ‘no CARNS1 could be detected’ (in non-excitable tissues). The corresponding data in Figure 4, appears to show a CARNS1 protein band in the adipose/kidney tissue lane – of a similar magnitude to the heart tissue lane. Was this below the limit of detection? Further, it appears that there was very little (perhaps insufficient) protein loaded in the heart and adipose tissue lanes. Did you explore whether this was a measurement issue? There are some inconsistencies in the data presented in Figure 7. The percentages reported in panel A do not match the corresponding data e.g., BAL/NAC increases as +97/199%. Panels A and B have 11 carnosine datapoints, whereas panel C has ~42 datapoints. It is unclear why these numbers should differ, as they appear to be from the same samples. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify this disparity. The paper uses the term ‘systematic approach’ and estimates that 99.1% of total HCDs are contained in skeletal muscle. We are unsure the language should be that strident, given the range of tissues measured, the overall small N per population, and that various tissues are from pathological tissues. From the analysis, it would be possible to say that ‘of the tissues measured’… 99.1% of the HCD content was found in skeletal muscle samples. The methods state that the human CNS tissue was from ‘non-demented controls, indicating the absence of neurological and psychiatric disease’ – was absence of disease confirmed from the participant characteristics? If not, then the term ‘non-demented’ may not be indicate of people free from neurological and psychiatric disease. Figure 7. From the methods used (i.e., NAC not labelled), is it possible to determine that this was specifically NAC release/reuptake, or could it be reflective of a general appearance? The discussion mentions ‘there appears to be a relationship between CARNS1 expression and HCD content on a whole-body level… However, the correlation between CARNS1 expression and HCD content was not perfect, suggesting that there might be inter-organ exchange…’ – the statement appears to relate to data from Figure 4, but it is not clear where the statistical analyses of these correlations/relationships are. Did the authors perform these analyses?",2023-03-30T16:05:24,disqus_0MYVPRM3Xm,Joe Matthews,10.1101/2023.02.16.528841,"Extensive profiling of histidine-containing dipeptides reveals species-specific distribution and metabolism in mice, rats and humans","Thibaux Van der Stede, Jan Spaas, Sarah de Jager, Jana De Brandt, Camilla Hansen, Bjarne Vercammen, Siegrid De Baere, Siska Croubels, Ruud Van Thienen, Kenneth Verboven, Dominique Hansen, Thierry Bové, Bruno Lapauw, Charles Van Praet, Karel Decaestecker, Bart Vanaudenaerde, Bert O Eijnde, Lasse Gliemann, Ylva Hellsten, Wim Derave",2023-02-19

The probability of false-positive or false-negative results may be decreased and statistical power may be increased by increasing the sample size. b)	Incorporate extra controls: The study utilized wild-type and knockout mice as controls. Including other control groups, however, such as mice with a heterozygous deletion of the PCYT2 gene or mice with a knockout of a different gene, may be advantageous. This would assist in eliminating any possible confusing effects. c)	The study used mice as a model organism, and it is uncertain whether the results can be generalized to human populations to validate the findings. By examining gene expression patterns in muscle biopsies or carrying out clinical trials with PCYT2 modulators, additional studies could examine the function of PCYT2 in muscle health and aging in human populations. d)	Employ more sophisticated methods for data analysis: The study examined levels of gene and protein expression using Western blotting and qPCR. Yet, further approaches like RNA sequencing, proteomics, or metabolomics may offer a more thorough comprehension of the molecular pathways governing muscle health and aging. e)	Perform functional studies: The study did not look into the underlying mechanisms, despite demonstrating the importance of PCYT2 in muscle health and aging.

The following are suggestions from a group of students from The Sainsbury Laboratory who read and discussed your pre-print with great interest: It would be helpful to provide an explanation for the large variation in quantities of hits for each selected LRR-RLK in Figure 1 and define which species are represented for each LRR-RLK hit from your pipeline for added transparency. Additionally, could the small number of hits found for some LRR-RLKs indicate higher divergence between proteins and thus a difficulty in identifying more members? We were wondering if it makes sense to query the phylogenetically represented database (1K Transcriptomes) with a Hidden Markov Model based on LRR-RLKs from a small subset of species that are not phylogenetically representative. We suggest using ""kinase"" or ""intracellular"" domain instead of ""RLK domain"" in the paper for better clarity. Could you please provide more transparency on how you selected the LRR-RLKs you studied in the paper? Ideally, using members from more than one clade and being clear about clade/subfamily/subclade notation would be beneficial. Additionally, having equal representation from both functional groups (development and defence) would allow presenting a more comprehensive conclusion on the comparison between LRR-RLKs involved in development and defence. Do most genomes have more developmental LRR-RLKs than defence LRR-RLKs? We wanted to know if your hypothesis about the divergent rates between defence and developmental receptors would change if the defence LRR-RLKs bind to ligands that do not quickly evolve since LRR-RLKs including FLS2 and EFR bind to highly conserved epitopes from pathogens, not effectors. The main finding of the paper that there was no significant difference between LRR domain evolution in developmental and defence LRR-RLKs is not well-reflected in the title. Including a discussion of the ligands for each receptor and whether these are present natively in the plant would be useful along with Figure 3. We hope these suggestions are helpful, and we appreciate your effort in advancing the understanding of LRR-RLK evolution.",2023-03-29T17:06:48,tslpreprintgroup,TSL pre-print group,10.1101/2023.03.13.532436,Asymmetric evolution of protein domains in the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) family of plant developmental coordinators,"Jarrett Man, Thomas Harrington, Kyra Lally, Madelaine E.

Except the  attribute given to the causal factors such as feeding, I could not grasp: (a) how and where the authors quantified bioturbation or uprooting effects of foraging cyprinids?; (b) where and how the authors quantified repeated feed application in littoral zone/ bed made them unsuitable for recurrent aquatic macrophyte growth?; (c) what is the redfield ratio of feed input and how it dilutes or upconcentrates the same ratio in littoral bed making them unsuitable?. The authors show nicely temporal trends of littoral machrophyte zone shrinking (OKAY), but do not show direct causal relationship with attributes for which they are blaming the reason (e.g., feeding or no feeding). One can say, the same inference could be drawn for climate change too (perhaps stronger after evaluating a multi-decadal water stress in the territory). If fishpond management is to blame, why chasing feed application alone, when there are bigger causes such as farmers preferring not to keep them as they interfere with netting/ harvesting operations. Why not discuss these? Lastly, an intuitive point to consider, higher the littoral macrophyte vegetation (especially the emergent ones), more intense is the evapotranspiration by the pond body; because there is more surface area which actively evapo-transpires. This is further compounded by water stress (climate change), see the IPCC report published recently. Is not the relationship between shrinkage of littoral vegetation cover and a good littoral vegetative cover, universally juxtaposed forever? As a matter of fact, if recent IPCC report is true, one could question if keeping dense macrophyte beds (littoral) is even reasonable to combat water stress, and not making green belts around the pond instead. Which is efficient and not counter-productive? To conclude, the publication has a strong logic, but it could easily discuss its results on a broader context; instead of localizing its focal point with things that are more socio-politically charged and less of science. I recommend the study to be published; but also request the learned authors (with good legacies of work behind their names) to consider this request.

However, we regret that all previous studies we have published on the same topic (Fournier et al., 2021; Devaux et al., 2021; Colson et al., 2021; Colson et al., 2023) have been ignored here. Practically, France did not implement systematic SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in mink farms during the summer of 2020, despite information circulating at the WHO after information from Holland and Denmark showing that there were SARS-CoV-2 epidemics among farm mink that were transmissible to humans, and then, in a human-to-human manner (Larsen et al., 2021; Oude Munnink et al., 2021). In France, after the first incidence wave, a new rise of incidence was observed during summer 2020 that started in June from Mayenne (in the left upper corner of France), a department where SARS-CoV-2 cases were reported in two slaughterhouses including one in Laval in June 2020 and that is close to the Eure-et-Loir department, where there was the French farm with minks diagnosed SARS-CoV-2-positive mid-November 2020. Interestingly, the re-increase of Covid-19 cases in France was associated with the emergence of a new variant, which we identified in our geographical area and we called ""Marseille 4"" and which was classified in the B.1.160 Pangolin lineage (Fournier et al., 2021). We tried to get access to the SARS-CoV-2 sequences or samples of the mink of the Eure-et-Loir farm, but we could not get them, and the first sequence was published 4 months after the systematic culling of the whole mink reservoir. Our epidemiological hypothesis was that the ""Marseille 4"" epidemic, which predominated and was the most severe between August 2020 and February 2021 in France, had its origin in mink farming, and indeed, the first sequence released showed a perfect similarity with the very many sequences of this variant that we were able to obtain from humans, as we already reported in 3 publications of studies analyzing these sequences (Fournier et al., 2021; Colson et al., 2021). Moreover, a Marseille-4 genome was found in a mink sampled in October 2020 in Italy (Moreno et al., 2022). Our hypothesis is that mink generated a new variant transmissible to humans as in the Netherlands and in Denmark. It is a pity that, in a publication of this nature, all these elements, which have already been published and are on-line, were not integrated into a discussion of the epidemics of SARS-CoV-2 in French mink farms.

Abstract- ….”OGT-KO mice exacerbated DEN-induced HCC developments with increased inflammation, fibrosis, and YAP signaling”  YAP1 is active and localized to nucleus for proliferative activities only in O-GlcNAcylated state, without OGT YAP undergoes phosphorylation and translocation to cytosol for subsequent ubiquitination. 2.	Methods-… “For chronic OGT deletion, two-month-old male OGT-floxed mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with AAV8-TBG-GFP or AAV8-TBG-CRE, and tissues were collected 35 days after AAV8 administration” Here administering AAvs via IP seems out of place, has any reports of its success been documented??? 3.	Results- ….There was no difference in OGT protein levels in healthy, steatosis, and NASH samples, but OGT was completely absent in cirrhosis and HCC samples” the ogt levels seem increased in steatosis and NASH, but glycation is otherwise no conclusive data. •	Western blot analysis was utilized to confirm successful OGT-KO (Fig. 2B).  I can not see significant OGT deletion or global o-glycation. IP ADMINISTRATION OF AAV FAILURE?? •	“Depletion of O-GlcNAcylation promotes diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC”  2 months post OGT deletion is too short duration. •	…..Lastly, we found decrease in phosphorylated LATS and phosphorylated Yap but an increase in total Yap in OGT-KO mice compared to control mice (Fig. 6O). qPCR on YAP target genes (Ctgf and Ankrd1) corroborated the YAP activity data (Fig. 6P). These data indicated that proliferation is governed by YAP signaling…” this statement is contradictory to YAP dynamics it switches between glycated and phosphorylated forms, while phosphorylated form is destined for turning over the glycated one is active and stable. Increase in phosphorylation should relate to opposite of what authors are claiming. 4.	Discussion- •	“The HCC model we implied was only a 7 month after DEN-injections with only 2 month of OGA deletion. This is relatively short to allow HCC to develop.” But the same duration was conclusive enough for authors for after effects of OGT deletion. •	“Two O-GlcNAcylation sites have currently been mapped to YAP, Ser127 and Thr241. Interestingly, one site is thought to inhibit HCC progress (Ser127), while the other enhances disease progression (Thr241). Both modifications act by increasing the translocation and activity of YAP; however, each seems to have a different role. Ser127 leads to increased cell proliferation and survival, whereas Thr241 modification allows YAP to upregulate the transferrin receptor (TFRC), promoting cell death through ferroptosis.” The bold text regarding glycation at Thr241 are contradictory. •	The competition  of YAP/HNF4α for heterodimerization with TEAD4 is also contradictory. While lack of O-GlcNAcylation leads to downregulation of HNF4α, IT DOES SO WITH YAP too. Need satisfactory explanation 5.	Our Conclusion- The study needs thorough revision and validation with satisfactory explanation of the outcomes.",2023-03-22T19:03:10,disqus_7tyB47z6Be,Wasim Khan,10.1101/2023.02.16.528884,The Essential Role of O-GlcNAcylation in Hepatic Differentiation,"Dakota R.

Overall, I believed this is a very strong paper, but have a few comments that you may take into consideration: In the cohort chart, I would ensure that your statistical analyses are correct. I see that in Cohort #1, you employed largely Mann-Whitney tests implying that your data was nonparametric, however in Cohort #2, you employed parametric tests (Pearson & unpaired t-test) to statistically analyze the data. Was the data set in Cohort #2 parametric? Put a reference and/or graph displaying what criteria/qualifications that are involved in ABC scoring.

Human coronavirus OC43 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus beta-coronavirus within the family Coronaviridae. Research interest in the immunopathology of beta-coronaviruses has increased following the emergence of SARS-Cov-2, the causative agent of the disease COVID-19. OC43 infection generally causes mild respiratory symptoms and is grouped into the broad category of seasonal “common-cold” coronaviruses. However, like SARS-CoV-2, it can also cause more severe symptoms in those that are of older age or immunocompromised. Recent studies have found that T cells directed against seasonal human coronaviruses such as OC43 cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 indicating a potential protective role. Currently, there is still a knowledge gap about the specific immune response elicited by “common-cold” coronaviruses and their potential in offering protective immunity against more pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS. In this study, authors aimed to identify and characterize specific seasonal coronavirus CD4+ T cell epitopes and explore their ability to cross-react with T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2. Utilizing a human embryonic kidney cell line transduced with CIITA, the immunopeptidome presented by MHC classes was identified following OC43 infection. Moreover, the authors identified a total of 83 peptides derived from some of the major structural proteins and enzymes comprising OC43. Expanded T-cell populations in vitro found that CD4+ T cells recognized OC43 viral peptides. Seasonal human coronavirus specific epitopes were also identified along with two SARS-CoV-2 cross reactive CD4 epitopes. Overall, this study provides interesting insight into the immune response to seasonal human coronaviruses and highlights the possible protective role of identified T cell epitopes as a whole. Positive feedback. The use of the ELIspot assay over an ELISA assay served as good experimental advancement since the ELIspot assay can detect protein levels of cytokines with greater sensitivity and provides a quantitative assessment of cell number. The use of MassSpec provided a way of identifying new epitopes since it was an untargeted method. The amount of samples analyzed through this manuscript was quite impressive. The color scheme used for different MHC classes was consistent and helped with clarity of figures. The spacing and flow of panels within each figure was laid out well. Major Concerns The study did address that the human embryonic kidney cell line(HEK-293) is not the natural target of OC43 and therefore not the most physiologically relevant. MRC-5, a lung fibroblast cell line, would be a good candidate as it is a natural target and has been shown to propagate OC43 well. It was mentioned that among the 6 biological replicates, 11-68% of the HEK293 CIITA cells showed expression of OC43 nucleoprotein. This is a rather large variability. More explanation or analysis of what this might mean would be helpful. In Figure 3 E-F, donor consistency varies between peptides. P1 and P6 have the same donor, but P2 only has one of the same donors. P4 has two completely different donors as compared to the rest.  The lowest peptide dose eliciting a positive response will vary across donors. Since donors serum was not available to test for confirmed exposure to OC43 or other seasonal human coronaviruses, a western blot could be performed on PBMCs with an antibody against OC43 Spike protein to confirm exposure. HEK-293 were transduced with CIITA, which was acknowledged to potentially block effects of viral infection. It would have been good to keep a non-transduced line of HEK-293 as a control to better assess the possibility of CIITA counteracting effects. The healthy individuals that the PBMCs were isolated from were not clearly described. This information is said to be in the supplemental figures (not provided though on biorxiv), but it would be helpful to have the age and current health status of the patients described in the text. It would be useful to know the prevalence of the HLAs for identified peptides in the population to determine how relevant these findings are. In figure 3 G, it would be helpful to normalize to cell numbers so that cell death can be accounted for. In figure 3 G, a known stimulus for IFN-y such as PMA would be useful to have as a positive control. Minor concerns It would have been of interest to explain the use of the TCID50 assay over a plaque assay which is the usual gold standard for quantifying infectious virus particles. The layout of the figures was slightly disorganized and not always laid out sequentially. Arranging them horizontally instead of vertically would help with ease of reading. For example, in Figure 1 B-F. Supplemental figure legends were provided, but not the supplementary figures. It was also not clear on where to access them. It would be good to make these more accessible. It would be helpful to briefly describe the significance of CD107a as it will not be familiar to someone who is not an expert. In Figure 3 G, the panel is difficult to read. In Figure 3 E-F, the overall take home message from this data is not well described. In Figure 1, datasets could be evaluated for possible post-translational modifications which may affect binding to MHC I and II. This would be interesting, as some post-translational modifications promote MHC binding (Engelhard VH, Altrich-Vanlith M, Ostankovitch M, Zarling AL.

Specific APC used is not specified in Figure 3 B-C. Antibodies used to detect the proteins produced by MHC-II were specific (HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP), but the antibodies used to detect MHC-1 proteins, HLA-ABC, were not. More explanation as to why this was the case might be helpful. It might be beneficial to explore other types of immune cells other than T cells, such as B cells, as this might greatly expand the scope of the study. This could be addressed in the discussion just to clarify why T cells were chosen specifically. It might be beneficial to refer to the viral peptides presented by MHC-II as something other than natural as it was acknowledged that the expression of MHC-II proteins was enhanced using CIITA.",2023-03-21T20:47:35,,MICR 603 Journal Club,10.1101/2022.12.01.518643,Immunopeptidome profiling of human coronavirus OC43-infected cells identifies CD4 T cell epitopes specific to seasonal coronaviruses or cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2,"Aniuska Becerra-Artiles, Padma P.

Furthermore, since the supplementary material provides data that has been standardized by quartiles, it cannot be reversed to the unnormalized TPM data.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.28.529746v1#comment-6139958577,biorxivstage,1,"PTP1b has been an attractive target for drug development due to its essential role in several cellular pathways and diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Focus has been paid to identifying allosteric sites that regulate catalytic activity via altering the dynamics of the active site WPD loop. However, the structural mechanisms underlying the WPD loop opening and closing (which is relatively slow by NMR) remains unclear. In this paper, the authors sought to identify the structural mechanisms underlying PTP1b loop motion by performing long time scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Starting from existing structures with the WPD loop either open or closed, they are able to derive reasonable estimations of the kinetics of loop opening and closing. They address the question of what structural changes need to occur for the loop to remain open or closed as it fluctuates. Using a random forest approach, they narrow their focus down to the PDFG motifs backbone dihedrals as a set of features sufficient for describing and predicting loop movement between states. The major strength of this paper is reducing the WPD loop conformation (including transient states) down to a set of reaction coordinates in the PDFG motif dihedral angles. Based on this minimum set of features, the committor probabilities provide a strong statistical argument for the transition between open, closed, and transient states along the loop trajectory. The major weakness of this paper is that the visualizations describing the PDFG motif switch model are insufficient and confusing and lack an atomic explanation of how these dihedral changes occur in the context of surrounding residues to complement their statistical explanations. This makes it difficult to interpret what the actual transitions look like. We understand that the atomic explanation of this mechanism can be complicated but refer the authors to this paper as an example even though it is a different target and may not be specifically relevant to their work: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go... (Fig 3) The reaction coordinates alone do not provide a clear direction for envisioning future experiments. Given that this motif is conserved (as the authors explained), other PTP members likely have different structural environments surrounding the motif which likely affects kinetic rates and thermodynamics. Major Points: Previous structural studies of PTP’s have identified atypical open loop conformations in GLEPP1, STEP, and Lyp: https://www.sciencedirect.c... Fig 3A. These loops adopt a novel loop conformation that is more open compared to PTP1B. Further, the presence of catalytic water molecules that are tightly bound in closed states and absent in open states have been suggested to play a role in the closing of the WPD loop. Can the authors provide comments on how the PDFG motif factors into the novel open loop conformation (would the motif dihedrals still predict loop states in these family members)? Were water molecules detected in the binding site and do they play a role during loop closure? Is it possible to include within these simulations mixed solvent MD with a PTP1B substrate to explore their roles in the loop transition? “We note that although the PD[F/H]G BLAST search did return matches in other protein families, there was not the structural information corresponding to those matches that would be needed to draw further conclusions on the conformational significance of PD[F/H]G motifs in those families.” - We feel this is a missed opportunity to at least do some exploration and cataloging using the alphafold structures of these other families. The authors describe the backbone dihedrals of the PDFG motif as being sufficient and necessary for predicting WPD loop conformation but do not mention the side chain conformations. We feel that the explanation and visualization of the side chain conformations in both open and closed states is unclear as there is no analysis of how these transitions and conformations affect the populations and rate movement of the loop. What do the rotamer conformations and transitions look like for the PDFG during open, closed, and transient WPD loop states? How do these rotamer conformations affect loop movements and populations within the simulation? It would be insightful if the authors could provide an explanation of the rotamer transitions during loop opening and closing. Understanding these structural changes during substrate binding and catalysis could yield targets for drug development. Minor Points: Supplementary figures S2, S3, S4, and S5 have little to no information to adequately explain what is being illustrated. The authors should be more clear in describing what these figures represent. A description of axes, experimental set up, and legends would be helpful. The observation that loop fluctuations without long term stability unless the PDFG motif switches is reminiscent of the population shuffling model of conformational changes put forward by Colin Smith - https://onlinelibrary.wiley.... Given the previous NMR data on PTP1B, how does this view alter the interpretation away from a strict two state model? “The free energy estimate from these AWE simulations was ΔGclosed-to-open = −2.6 ± 0.1 kcal mol-1, indicating that the transition from closed to open states is spontaneous (Figure 2b), a finding that is again consistent with experimental data” We are a bit confused by the language here: is this a thermodynamic or kinetic argument? Secondarily, how do the populations compare to those derived from NMR? As previously discussed in a twitter thread with the authors, the backbone ramachandran regions of the 1SUG structure (closed WPD loop conformation) is not in a region previously known for kinases. It would be helpful if the authors could provide validation that the backbone ramachandran regions of the WPD loop are in agreement with what is known about kinases states and whether this would affect their interpretations. https://twitter.com/RolandD...",2023-03-17T20:20:35,,CJ San Felipe,10.1101/2023.02.28.529746,A conserved local structural motif controls the kinetics of PTP1B catalysis,"Christine Y.

The novel approach to defining fibrosis in post-MI models is so interesting, and is a great build upon your previous findings. The mathematical modeling of cold vs. hot fibrosis was an impressive approach. A couple comments regarding the experimental approach: 1 - Considering how different myocardial infarction progresses in male and female humans, and how differently each sex responds post-MI, the lack of differentiation between sexes in the murine and porcine models was concerning. All kinds of factors related to sex can influence post-MI condition, and identifying samples by sex may have explained some of the variability (as seen in Figure 2E). 2 - While the GO analysis refinement of the bulk RNA-seq data is intriguing and provokes question of further study, establishing continuity in using scRNA-seq for both the murine and porcine models would have made for a better comparison of the data. 3 - The UMAP in Supplemental Figure 1A shows a much different gene expression profile in the fibroblasts and myofibroblasts at the end of the healing period in comparison with the early healing period. This would suggest that the ending fibroblasts have much a different identity in comparison to the starting ones, and calls into question whether the two populations can be deemed to be the same. Perhaps further study into differential gene expression of these two populations could be beneficial to the project.",2023-03-16T01:54:59,helenthome,HELEN THOME,10.1101/2023.01.01.522422,Circuit to target approach defines an autocrine myofibroblast loop that drives cardiac fibrosis,"Shoval Miyara, Miri Adler, Elad Bassat, Yalin Divinsky, Kfir B.

Two other datasets, including one containing 700 representative prokaryotic proteomes constructed by Moody et al. (2022) and another containing several novel hgc-carriers published by Lin et al. (2021), were retrieved and incorporated into the RP75 dataset. Totally 169 HgcA sequences were collected after removing redundancies Comment: I might have missed something, but it appears that you have included hgcAB sequences that are either included in the PF03599 protein family or MAGs from Lin et al. Are the HgcA protein sequences from the large curation efforts from McDaniel et al. 2020, Capo et al. 2022, and Gionfriddo et al. 2020 for example integrated into this uniprot release? It would seem easier in this case to pull directly from the Capo et al. database since those are curated sequences and metadata to link back to, unless I'm missing how Uniprot accessions work with incorporating data from MAGs Response: Thank you for pointing this out. We considered using the MATE-Hg database from Capo et al. 2022 for this study at first, but some reasons made us turn to the UniProt Reference Proteomes (RP) database eventually. First, this work considered the gene tree (HgcA tree) and the species tree (house-keeping genes tree) together to resolve the evolutionary history. Since the MATE-Hg database does not contain the house-keeping gene information, we decided to use the RP database. Second, to build the species tree, high-quality genomes are required to extract enough house-keeping marker genes. Some host genomes in MATE-Hg database are not in high quality; they might not contain enough marker genes or might be produced from mistaken/biased binning processes. Third, in order to confirm the true hgcB genes to elaborate their evolution history, we used more strict criteria than the MATE-Hg database. Our study determined hgcB genes not only according to the HMM profile of HgcB, but also required they are located close to hgcA genes. Finally, the RP set we used is sampled from all UniProt proteomes containing most genomes in the MATE-Hg database. Therefore, the final dataset we used is representative and should be ideal to study the evolution of Hg methylation. Text: A few putative HGT events could be inferred from the larger clade of the HgcA tree e.g., Marinimicrobia-HgcA clustered with Euryarchaeota-HgcA in the archaeal cluster, Comment: Was the inference made by position in the tree or analyzing the pairwise sequence identity similarity of the proteins from this Archaea/Marinimicrobia? I am curious because in McDaniel et al. 2020 mSystems we also found only a few potentially clear cases of HGT but did this through pairwise sequence analysis, for example for a case of Deltaproteobacteria/Acidobacteria/Verrucomicrobia/Actinobacteria in permafrost Response: This inference was made by position in the tree and also the sequence identity. Marinimicrobia is a bacterial phylum, but the hgcA genes they carry are clustered with other archaeal HgcA in the HgcA tree. Also, the closest sequence with Marinimicrobia-HgcA in the nr database is the HgcA sequence from Theionarchaea archaeon DG-70-1, which has 98% coverage, 56% identity, and 72% similarity by blastp. We have also discussed this in our previous paper Lin et al., 2021 ISMEJ. Text Nevertheless, several hgcA+ genomes did not carry neighbouring hgcB genes, including all Nitrospina and a few Deltaproteobactiera and Firmicutes, potentially because of gene loss during evolution or incomplete transfer events (i.e., only hgcA genes were acquired during the HGT events). Comment: I wanted to clarify something from the methods - were just the hgcAB proteins from uniprot pulled down or the entire genome sequences for these hgcAB+ representatives? If you did have the entire genome, did you check for the cases where hgcB was missing if hgcA fell close to the end of a contig or not? I think Peterson et al. 2020 ES&T had a couple cases that hgcA was at the end of a contig Response: We have the entire genome sequences. We have ruled out the situation where hgcB was missing because of incomplete assembly. We confirmed that hgcA was not at the end of a contig and genes other than hgcB were located downstream or upstream of the hgcA. Text: Figure 3. Comment : Are these trees rooted with either cdh outgroups or fused hgcAB? I see the symbol for fused hgcAB but in Gionfriddo et al. 2020 fused sequences are usually used to root the tree for accurate topology inference Response: The HgcA tree in Figure 2 was rooted according to the MAD- and outgroup-rooting analyses shown in Figure 1. In that analysis, the root of the gene family tree was placed between CdhD and CdhE, with the ""small clade"" emerging at the base of HgcA. Therefore, fused HgcA is not appropriate to be used as an outgroup alone. Text: Our study reveals an ancient origin for microbial mercury methylation, evolving from LUCA to radiate extensively throughout the tree of life both vertically, albeit with extensive loss, and to a lesser extent horizontally. Comment: I think to make a statement like this you would need more extensive analyses quantitatively calculating gene transfer rates and using tree dating methods such as in https://journals.asm.org/do... Response: The evidence from our analysis that HgcA was already present in LUCA is its sister relationship to the CdhE clade, a group of genes which both our tree and those of others (e.g., Adam et al., 2018) suggest was already present in LUCA. If this hypothesis is correct, then the gene must have been lost extensively during subsequent evolution because it is less widespread across Bacteria and Archaea than are the CdhE (and CdhD) families today. We agree it would be interesting to know precisely when these events occurred during evolution, but this is a difficult problem for single gene trees, especially ones containing ancient splits. Note that the study cited as an example dates a species tree (of Streptomyces), not a gene family tree (as we would need to do to date the events within the CdhD/E/HgcA family. Published dated species trees of Archaea and Bacteria suggest that LUCA might have lived close to the formation of the planet ~4.5Ga (e.g., Betts et al. 2018, Moody et al. 2022), suggesting the deepest divergences between CdhE, D and HgcA occurred prior to that date, although these ancient nodes are difficult to estimate. Timing the subsequent loss of lineages within the HgcA clade would be interesting, but is impeded because it is not straightforward to determine when, or how many, losses took place along the long stem branch. Text: We mapped the presence/absence of merB and hgc genes onto the Tree of Life Comment: If I interpreted the methods correctly, this tree only includes ribosomal proteins from genomes that either have hgcAB/merB or both of them. This isn't exactly overlaying hgcAB/merB presence/absence onto the ""tree of life"" because to accurately portray these relationships you would also want to include genomes that have neither or these operons. To do this accurately you would want to overlay the information you have here including genomes that are in Hug et al. 2016 for example Response: Thanks for pointing this out. Yes, we agree that this is not the ‘tree of life’. The tree only includes genomes that either have hgcAB or merB or both of them. So this is a species tree rather than a tree of life. We will modify the sentence in the next version to clarify. The modification will not affect the results that we deduced from the tree",2023-03-15T18:03:08,disqus_JxAdGPUNqR,John Moreau,10.1101/2022.11.21.517362,Ancient origin and evolution of microbial mercury methylation,"Heyu Lin, Edmund R.

Their application to prospectively discover binding sites and to screen compounds interacting at those sites, remains a frontier application, even for compounds with high potency. Here, simulations are used to run a “virtual fragment screen”/”swimming experiment” for two compounds with very weak binding affinity that they identified as potential hits by SPR. In some sense, because of the weak affinity and limited interactions, these results are much more impressive and surprising than the landmark “How does a drug molecule find its target binding site” paper from the Shaw group a decade ago ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.... The poses are validated with crystal structures of these fragments bound to PTP1b. The major strength of this paper is showing that MD simulations can identify weakly bound fragments at allosteric sites (even those not previously highlighted extensively in fragment screens) with binding poses that closely resemble experimentally obtained structures. The major weakness of this paper is that the authors only performed “swimming” on two fragments, which does not allow us to generalize how well MD simulations both predict other allosteric sites and how well MD simulations predict fragment poses of larger chemical spaces of varying fragment sizes. Given the large number of negative controls available from the SPR screen and the relatively large number of positive (ish? - as affinities weren’t measured) controls from Keedy et al fragment screens, a larger study could be conducted - but for now, this work remains a tantalizing glimpse into the capabilities and potential of the swimming method for PTP1b. Major points: The authors initially performed SPR to identify two fragments for MD simulation and crystallization but this appears to be a very small number of fragments for MD. Could they discuss how feasible (or not) would it be to perform MD simulations of the whole library to identify potentially weaker fragments that may not have been detectable by SPR? Additionally, how might the “swimming” approach compare to a more conventional pipeline (e.g. identifying binding sites and fragment pose compare to mixed solvent MD with virtual docking)? The authors describe two binding sites for the fragments they identified through SPR, one that was previously identified (DES-4884) and a second site that they report as an allosteric site (DES-4779) but do not describe or provide structures of any broader structural changes to PTP1b that occur as a result of fragment binding at either site. The authors should show an alignment between apo and bound states of PTP1b to highlight allosterically induced structural changes. The authors highlight the DES-4884 fragment inducing two phenylalanine rearrangements (Phe196 and Phe280). While Phe196 conformational change has also been reported in fragment screens, they say that the Phe280 also swings out but don’t explain whether that could be of significance to future fragment screens (does Phe280 create new binding opportunities, increase/decrease fragment affinity, induce broader changes to the structure of PTP1B?) It would be helpful if the authors could contextualize the phenylalanine rearrangements with what is previously known about this allosteric site for future fragment screens. Minor points: We feel that the crystallography section of the methods and materials is incomplete. It would be helpful if the authors: 1)  explained what PTP1b construct they used, 2) the crystallization conditions, 3) the structure resolutions, 4) method of obtaining fragment bound structure (fragment soaking vs co-crystallization) and 5) how they identified the fragments in their crystal structures. Further information about how crystal diffraction data was collected and processed would be helpful. Figure 3e: The authors show the DES-6016 variant of DES-4884 makes hydrogen bonds with at least two water molecules. Do the authors propose that this allosteric site requires coordination with water molecules for fragment binding? How stable are the water molecules in the MD simulation to support this? The authors mention that for each fragment there were additional minor binding sites from the MD simulations. During the crystallization experiments, were fragments detected at these binding sites as well?

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.03.515069v1#comment-6133954829,biorxivstage,1,"Hello. Below is a review compiled by the MICR603 ""Journal club in immunology"" at the University of Tennessee Knoxville: UTK MICR603 “Journal club in immunology” review of the paper by Gomes et al. “Shigella induces epigenetic reprogramming of zebrafish neutrophils Summary. Innate immunity training is a growing field of immunological research. Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and β-glucan are the two most studied triggers in innate immunity, but research using other triggers such as metabolites and inflammatory cytokines is much more understudied and primarily focuses on macrophage training. The authors of this paper aim to fill in the gaps of neutrophil training in a host system using the human pathogen Shigella flexneri. Gomes et al. use a zebrafish model to study trained innate immunity, and they demonstrate that neutrophil priming with Shigella successfully generates a protective immune response against reinfection. They also dive deeper into the factors that could contribute to this immune response, such as host immune factors, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and Shigella effector proteins. The authors also show that this neutrophil priming induces an increase in the histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation epigenetic marker in neutrophils, and they show that primed neutrophils show greater antimicrobial capabilities via mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Positive feedback. This study broaches a much needed subject of research on the development of strengthening host immune responses to a human pathogen that is lacking any effective vaccines or preventative treatments. A positive for this paper is the reasoning behind using zebrafish as a model organism for this study. As the authors state, zebrafish lack a trained immunity until 4 weeks post-infection, causing them to rely solely on their innate immunity. Zebrafish are also effective models for studying human pathogens, as they share greater than 80% of disease associated genes with humans. The authors do a great job of showing that their method of neutrophil priming does indeed induce a trained immune response and that it is non-specific and long lasting. They use multiple infections with Shigella and other bacterial components throughout the paper to establish the validity of using their system with this bacterial pathogen. The use of different pathogenesis screens (cell bacterial cell counts and zebrafish survival) and different techniques (imaging, survival screens, FACS sorting, etc.) also enhances the strength of their methods. The authors also do well with showing that Shigella-induced trained immunity can be protective against other bacteria other than Shigella, specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Another positive component of this paper is the use of ample supplementary figures to support claims they are making in their main text. Major Concerns There is some conversation lacking on prior research on what is known about how S. flexneri interacts with the host immune system. Adding in some more information on the current knowledge, or lack thereof, of how this pathogen interacts with the immune system would strengthen the reasoning behind this study. The authors should use a methyltransferase inhibitor, such as PF-06726304 acetate to confirm that histone methylation leads to immune training by Shigella. The authors are looking at histone h3 lysine 4 Histone h3 lysine 4 trimethylation as an epigenetic marker in this system, however, the reasoning for using this epigenetic marker in favor of others is unclear. For example, lysine 27 acetylation is a major transcription activator for human cells, and it would be beneficial to discuss why something like this was not explored. This epigenetic pathway could be playing a role in infection as well. Detection of cross-protection of trained innate immunity to different bacteria is interesting. Does that immunity work against viruses or fungi? Can this be tested or perhaps discussed (if testing it is too expensive currently)? Most of the analyses are presented for mRNA (e.g., for gene expression). It would be good to provide evidence for proteins too when possible and relevant. There is a bit of misinterpretation of the impact of Shigella immunization on neutrophils. The way the text is phrased currently is that immunization changes neutrophils. That is incorrect as “current” neutrophils are terminally differentiated cells and should die soon (within days in mammals). So, training is probably happening in stem cells that result in production of new neutrophils. This nuance must be carefully stated. - Or are neutrophils in fish long-lived and can be “trained” after leaving the bone marrow? We know that neutrophils may have their impact on bacteria more than just phagocytosis. How do authors know that i) suppression of growth, ii) NETs generation are not important in control of Shigella? Minor concerns The lethal dose of S. flexneri should be introduced as soon as the non-lethal dose is discussed for ease of comparison. Figures 1C &D - How were these cells quantified? Stating the exact method in the figure legend would make it more clear. Figure 1H & I -Including 24 and 48 hour time points like the ones included in C and D to these graphs would help readers fully compare the first and second infections. Figure 2F - These two data sets do not look significantly different. The figure legend just states that the P value is <0.05, but what is it specifically? Stating the actual P value would give readers the ability to see how close to the cut off the value actually, and it will solidify the significance. Figure 5A- FACS sorting neutrophils can sometimes change the physiology of the cells, as they often spontaneously NETose during sorting. This physiological change could have an impact on the ChIP-seq results, and a disclaimer stating this fact would be beneficial. Gating strategies for flow cytometry analysis (such as in Figure S5A) should be shown. Stating the doubling time of Shigella in zebrafish would be useful for data interpretation.

We appreciate how many controls and orthogonal experiments you did to test your hypotheses rigorously. One question we have is regarding the genetic background of the cell lines used e.g., A2780, A2058, HCT116, AGS, etc. Given that you made an important point about the mutual exclusivity between the 1q aneuploidy and TP53 mutations in patient cancer samples, we wondered if the cell lines used to manipulate chromosome ploidy were wild-type for TP53. Upon searching the literature and ATTC webpage, it seems like all of the above lines are WT for TP53 except for melanoma line A2058. Notably, this is also the line in which you show significant regain of chromosome 1q after deletion. We see that you tested the role of p53 in aneuploid addiction by mutating TP53 in the TP53-WT line A2780, but what role might the TP53 mutant status of A2058 cells play in their robust re-acquisition of 1q aneuploidy? Have you tried restoring the TP53 gene to its WT sequence in this cell line and comparing their ability to regain chromosome 1q?",2023-03-08T21:13:53,disqus_fzgAFe3M14,Elizabeth Duncan,10.1101/2023.01.09.523344,Oncogene-like addiction to aneuploidy in human cancers,"Vishruth Girish, Asad A.

To address the issue of false positives in our procedure, we employed several strategies. First, we used three machine reading systems to extract computable knowledge from the literature corpus, which helped to minimize subjective biases that could introduce false positives. Second, we used logical closure operations to infer missing knowledge and ensure that our search results were logically consistent. Third, we mapped the output to target terminologies and combined it with ontology-grounded resources to increase the accuracy and specificity of our search. Fourth, we translated epidemiological definitions of confounder, collider, and mediator into queries for searching the knowledge graph, which helped to reduce the risk of identifying variables that were not relevant to our study. While we did not explicitly measure the false positive rate (FPR) in our study, we acknowledge that this is an important consideration in causal feature selection. We plan to explore methods for measuring FPR in future work, such as using simulation studies or external validation with gold standard datasets. Regarding your comment on the potential for our procedure to return every entity that is connected to one of the parent nodes of Depression and AD, we agree that this is a risk. However, we used a combination of manual curation and computational approaches to select relevant literature and extract computable knowledge, which helped to reduce this risk. Additionally, we limited our search to variables that were causally related to depression and AD, which helped to narrow the scope of our search and increase the relevance of our results. As for the reasoning for allowing chains to cross through nodes with low specificity, we chose to include these nodes to capture all potential variables related to depression and AD, even if they were not specific to these conditions. We believe that this approach helped to identify variables that may have indirect or unexpected effects on the causal relationship between depression and AD. However, we acknowledge that this approach could increase the risk of false positives, and we plan to explore methods for minimizing this risk in future work. This paper introduces the method as a pilot project. Much more work needs to be done! (As the first author, I struggled with these ideas myself. A possibility is to explore using different centrality metrics. We shall see!) Please check out the newest version of the paper. I hope it makes things clearer for other questions you might have!",2023-03-08T15:18:06,scottmalec,S.
