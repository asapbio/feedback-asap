I have selected a particular preprint for my presentation, and, with input from my lab peers, we have compiled a set of suggestions aimed at enhancing the research. I want to commend the collective efforts of the authors involved in this study. The study's focus on plant parasitic interactions, given their intricate nature, is truly captivating. Investigating the processes and transmission of ROS signaling is vital for understanding a plant's stress response. Throughout our discussions, we identified several areas for potential improvement: (1) Regarding the references, although the bibliography is comprehensive, some sources appear to be secondary. (Please note here the specific references you are referring to, for example, reference A could potentially be replaced with B, etc.). (2) The absence of a methodology section is notable. While the innovative approach is intriguing, more detailed information about experimental conditions and materials is required for a comprehensive understanding of the results. (3) Consider incorporating additional graphical representations at intermediary time points, such as 10 and 20 minutes, in addition to the existing representation at 30 minutes, as seen in Fig 1(d) and Fig 2b, d, f. (4) In Fig 2(g), it is evident that the expression levels of certain genes in the donor plant are comparatively reduced in comparison to the recipient ones. It would be beneficial to include the authors' interpretation of this data to enhance the discussion. (5) We suggest including an extra supplementary figure that displays the expression levels of homologous genes in Cuscuta corresponding to AtAPX1, AtZAT10, AtZAT12, AtMYB30, and AtZHD5, along with the expression levels of Arabidopsis homologs for CcCSD1, CcNDPK2, and CcGLR2.7. We hope that our feedback proves valuable in refining your study.

This review resulted from the graduate-level course ""How to Read and Evaluate Scientific Papers and Preprints"" from the University of São Paulo, which aimed to provide students with the opportunity to review scientific articles, develop critical and constructive discussions on the endless frontiers of knowledge, and understand the peer review process. In this preprint Veryard et al. points out that for the past 25 years, ecological research has shown that biodiversity positively impacts ecosystem functions like biomass production when other variables are constant. Earlier experiments focused on grassland plant communities, but newer ones indicate similar benefits in plantations and forests. There's been limited research in tropical environments. This study presents preliminary results from a field-scale experiment in southeast Asia, examining the role of tree species diversity in restoring lowland tropical rainforests. Findings from Sabah, Malaysian Borneo suggest that active restoration, such as tree planting, accelerates forest recovery. This recovery is even more pronounced when using a diverse mix of tree species. The Sabah Biodiversity Experiment, conducted in the Malua forest reserve, involves different restoration methods on 500 ha of logged tropical forest. Observations reveal that the restoration is most effective when a diverse set of tree species is used for replanting. The study supports the idea that the positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning seen in other ecosystems also exists in SE Asia's lowland tropical rainforests. The data are reported in a clear way and the manuscript is well written. Data are consistent with the currently existing literature. Comments ●	About the soil preparation or pre-planting methods, it was highlighted that in one of the treatments the removal of lianas was used. Therefore, it would be interesting to highlight whether controls such as leaf-cutting ants, termites and weeds, fertilization methods and soil correction methods were used or not, even as standard for all treatments. ●	Perhaps the objective of the experiment was not to identify the diversity of species more than 10 years after planting, but considering that there was a survey of data in the field to compare the information from the satellite analysis, it would be interesting to obtain such information to also show that species diversity still exists in the places, since this is also a relevant indicator to consider areas as restored. In addition, this indicator can help to identify potentially monodominant species or even to identify the optimal number of species to be planted to maintain a desired final diversity. ●	It would also be important to highlight in the text the density of individuals planted per area, to reinforce that the increase in the indexes analyzed originated to the diversity of species and not just to a large density of individuals planted per area.",2023-09-06T14:50:01,jefersonlealsilva,Jeferson Leal Silva,10.1101/2022.09.09.507141,Positive effects of tree diversity on tropical forest restoration in a field-scale experiment,"Ryan Veryard, Jinhui Wu, Michael J.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.08.439100v1#comment-6271469641,biorxivstage,1,"This experimental work investigates the relationship between excitotoxicity and death of hypothalamic neurons, which is integrated by distinct populations that express different biomarkers. By the expression of the following differential biomarkers, these populations can be divided into two: melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), cocaine, and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART); and orexin, oxytocin, and vasopressin. Excitotoxicity is commonly seen in the population of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum and is the main cause of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease. On the other hand, the nature of the neurodegenerative process found in the hypothalamus remains unknown. Thus, the author's objective was to evaluate the relationship of quinolinic acid (QA)-mediated excitotoxicity in the hypothalamic regions of wild-type and transgenic HD mouse models. Below are my comments about the work: I would like to suggest the authors to remove the term “fatal” or replace it with “progressive” in the abstract and introduction. The fatality, or lethality, results from the knockout of the huntingtin gene ( https://doi.org/10.1242/dev..., while greater numbers of CAG repetition relative to huntingtin’s mutation and homozygote allele are related to early manifestations of symptoms and several clinical courses, respectively ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/W... https://doi.org/10.1093/bra.... In the introduction, I suggest the authors to modify the phrase “Excitotoxicity, i.e., excessive stimulation of the glutamate receptor, …”, as it is glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. This is because excitotoxicity can be conceptualized as cytotoxicity caused by increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations (DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.13-05-02085.1993). Therefore, excitotoxicity can be glutamate-dependent and -independent. We can also observe excitotoxicity when calcium concentrations increase by other pathways that are independent of glutamate receptors. In both cases, there will be a loss of the cell's ability to reestablish the homeostatic balance of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0903546106). In the conclusion topic, I think that could be interesting to further exploring the data obtained from selective excitotoxicity for the MCH-positive neurons. I say this because, although there is no amplification of the QA-induced excitotoxicity effect in the transgenic animals, the observation that the same neurons (i.e., the MCH-positive neurons) naturally undergo neurodegeneration seems to me an indication that the affected neuronal populations can die by different mechanisms; being, however, the MCH-positive neuronal cell death, probably, related to the glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. Thus, the hypothesis that the MCH-positive neuronal population is selectively affected by the glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity cannot be ruled out.",2023-09-05T17:39:31,lucasbonfimmarques,Lucas Bonfim Marques,10.1101/2021.04.08.439100,Effects of excitotoxicity in the hypothalamus in transgenic mouse models of Huntington disease,"Jo B.

The study ""Pain reflects the informational value of nociceptive inputs"" by Michel-Pierre Coll et al. examines the potentiality for the central nervous system to optimize pain’s learning function by being modulated by pain perception. Moreover, the author's hypothesized that nociceptive processing could be augmented when pain is surprising to facilitate predictive learning about pain. To see if this occurs, the authors record nociceptive flexion reflex amplitude combined with electroencephalography to link nociceptive flexion reflex modulation with the influx of ascending nociceptive signals to the cortex. On the electroencephalography they use two indices of expected pain. The first is the late positive potential (peaks around 400-600 ms after the pain-predictive cue). The second is a decrease of oscillatory power in the alpha and beta bands. This seems to be a very powerful take on how pain learning is associated with the expectation of pain. And the combinations of different methods of recording the perception of pain is a novelty in this area, combining the recording of nociceptive flexion reflex modulation amplitude with electroencephalography to link the modulation with the influx of ascending nociceptive information to the cortex. That way the authors can distinguish between the nociceptive responses and perception of pain in the participants and that the predictions errors between anticipated predictions and actual outcomes are associated with the nociceptive flexion reflex. The procedure of the experiment is very well delineated and explained in the text. The statistical analysis is very well explained and appropriate for the problem in hand. Then again, the authors did not specify why they use the three computational models that they choose to use. Although those three computational models are frequently used in studies about uncertainty in perception takes in volatile environments, the justification for their uses are intrinsically different. The justification for the use of a computational model must be a priori unless the study is about the models themselves. All that said, the interpretation for the basis why the Rescorla-Wagner model provided a better fit for the data is very good. Maintaining the environmental volatility relatively high and constant throughout the task due to the regular introduction of new cues is a very good way of simulating actual environmental conditions. Also, they did not say why they used thirty-five participants. Is always recommended to do a pilot to calculate effect and sample size or to justify this quantity from the literature or previous works from the group, published or not. It is argued that this is good enough to reach meaningful conclusions in this specific case. A limitation of this study is the dependence on the connection of the electroencephalography markers used for pain processing to aversive prediction errors that still don't have strong evidence in the literature. The authors make that clear in the text. Meanwhile, combining electroencephalography with functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional near-infrared spectroscopy may give more insights and give more evidence on pain processing to aversive prediction. The results of prediction errors being associated with increased pain perception and physiological pain responses and also with increased anticipatory cortical responses shows that this study is well done and very promising reliability and validity.",2023-09-01T16:20:46,disqus_IhM3mGPyfe,Bernard Costa,10.1101/2023.07.14.549006,Pain reflects the informational value of nociceptive inputs,"Michel-Pierre Coll, Zoey Walden, Pierre-Alexandre Bourgoin, Véronique Taylor, Pierre Rainville, Manon Robert, Dang Khoa Nguyen, Pierre Jolicoeur, Mathieu Roy",2023-07-18

Indeed, current pipelines of defensome analysis (DefenseFinder, Padloc) do not provide sufficient HMMs representative of the large diversity of these systems. They currently mainly focus on PsyrTA, RosmerTA, SanaTA and ShosTA with proven antiphage activity, and argue that ""Toxin-Antitoxin have not been included yet, as there is still some controversy if all members of such families are involved in anti-phage defense"". While the latter is true, there is currently in my view room for the inclusion of more families. Personally, I think that one of the reasons on why this has been delayed, relates partially to the high turnover and dN/dS of several TA genes, which makes it more tricky to build strong HMM models. The latter is something in which our group is actively working at for the eventual release of future analysis tools. In the case of this paper we have stated that our analyses are clearly underestimating the abundance of defense families (for reasons that are highlighted in the Discussion section), but we will definitely make sure to highlight the particular point of TAs (adding appropriate references).

We also thank you for citing three papers from our group. However, I am leaving this comment because our papers were not adequately nor accurately cited in your manuscript. First, we have already shown that asymmetric tension decides a budding direction in J Phys Chem B 126 (2022): 453-462 using our simulations. This is consistent with your findings, and none of your text mentioned this. Second, we have already carried out a large-scale coarse-grained simulation of lipid droplet biogenesis with seipin, published in Elife 11 (2022): e75808. This includes not only nucleation but also maturation and budding. We have further found and discussed the critical role of seipin transmembrane segments in maintaining a neck structure. In particular, based on our simulations, we proposed a mutant construct, which was further validated by experiment in our paper. The final structure of our CG molecular dynamics simulations is consistent with the experimental structure.  In that regard, our work has been cited in your paper only for nucleation but did not receive proper credit for budding and maturation. In particular, we disagree with the following two sentences in your manuscript: ""The function of seipin is also not completely clear: simulations and experiments suggested that it may trap triglycerides (13-15), therefore affecting LD nucleation and growth by ripening, but its localization at the LD-ER contact site raises questions on a possible role also in the budding process.” ""LD nucleation and phase separation were observed in simulations before (7,13,22,23,38), and occur on fast time scales (below the microsecond); in contrast, the budding process has never been observed so far, neither in simulations nor experimentally."" I hope our concerns are properly addressed during revision so that we do not have to write a comment to the journal in which your paper will be published. Thank you.

We collectively agreed it’s an exciting contribution to our understanding of how urbanization reshapes bird communities and their traits. During our discussion, a major point of debate was the ability of the Urban Association Index (UAI) to capture fundamental aspects of urban tolerance. The supplementary material explains important details on how this metric was obtained, but a few questions remained after our discussion. In particular, as the number of records has the potential to influence the mean UAI, widespread, very common species – even if they are equally common in cities and rural areas – may exhibit high UAI mean because most of the records from eBird come from urban areas (i.e., sampling bias). In this scenario, UAI may be amplified for abundant and/or eye-catching species. Perhaps the authors could check the correlation between mean UAI and the number of records to see the nature of this relationship. In this same line of thought, it might be opportune to explore how UAI varies across native vs. invasive species. We understand the reasoning for not differentiating native vs. exotic species (lines 114-116), but for species that were recently introduced through pet trade (e.g., Yellow-crested Cockatoo, Monk Parakeet - which are among those with the highest UAI values), not necessarily UAI is measuring tolerance to urbanization, particularly when their native habitats are not represented in the dataset. We also discussed that a possible approach to illuminate the biological meaning of UAI would be looking at the relationship between mean UAI and variance in UAI. Figure S5 shows how variance varies across species, apparently independent from the mean UAI. In this perspective, for instance, species with high UAI and high variance in UAI tend to be highly associated with cities but also occur in non-urban areas. In turn, species with high UAI and low variance in UAI are strict to cities, and so on. Congrats on the manuscript, and good luck with the next steps of this work!

In this preprint, the authors describe and discuss the structure of a Glycerol-3-phosphate Acyltransferase (GPAT) called PlsB. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the authors have successfully elucidated the complete structure of PlsB from Themomonas haemolytica (ThPlsB). The structural study revealed that ThPlsB forms a symmetric homodimer with three distinct domains in each monomer: the amino-terminal domain (NTD), the middle catalytic domain (MCD), and the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). Additionally, the study identified binding sites for a fatty acyl-CoA molecule and a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DOPA) molecule within the MCD of PlsB. It was also demonstrated that interactions between ThPlsB and the cell membrane involves two exposed amphipathic regions on the surface, located in the NTD and MCD. Based on structural and biochemical analyses, the authors propose a model in which PlsB associates with the membrane surface, coupling its catalytic activity to the biosynthesis of lysophosphatidic acid at the interface between the cell membrane and the cytosol. The data and hypotheses are well presented and written clearly and concisely, and it is an excellent piece of work that provides a new and significant perspective on the structure of PlsB. Major comments ● The outcomes are adeptly presented, offering the reader lucid and succinct comprehension. The executed experiments display a high level of proficiency, and the employed controls that were fittingly selected. This informative exploration of PlsB elucidates numerous structural facets of the enzyme. ● This work provides an excellent insight into the importance of the CTD, NTD, and MCD domains and offers an initial understanding of the aspects mediating the enzyme's interaction with the membrane. There are limitations in CryoEM that prevent the study of the protein bound to lipid bilayers, which justifies the use of micelles and the addition of DOPA. However, considering that the association of PlsB with the membrane is essential for its catalytic activity and that the bilayer association potentially could induce structural changes in the enzyme, possibly even in the active site, I believe that the study could be further enriched by incorporating methodologies aimed at analyzing the impacts on the structure and the aforementioned domains resulting from the protein's binding to LUVs lipid bilayers. ● In addition to the points mentioned earlier it would add value to the manuscript the characterization of the enzymatic activity in the presence of lipid bilayers as well. This would allow for the analysis of how the bilayer and its curvature influence the activity of both the wild-type enzyme and the mutants. Minor comments ● To provide a clearer context for introducing PlsY in the introduction, it might be beneficial to offer more explanatory information. The way it's currently presented could potentially confuse the reader. ● Including a figure illustrating the pathway and highlighting the position of PlsB could greatly enhance the reader's comprehension and appreciation of its importance. ● It could be interesting to perform enzymatic assays with acyl-ACP, another substrate of PlsB. ● The figure 6 could be improved in terms of clarity and didactic presentation in order to most adequately convey and summarize the discussed information to the reader.",2023-08-30T14:42:33,samuelguimarescostapereira,Samuel Guimarães Costa Pereira,10.1101/2023.04.30.538836,"The phospholipid biosynthesis enzyme PlsB contains three distinct domains for membrane association, lysophosphatidic acid synthesis and dimerization","Yumei Li, Anjie Li, Zhenfeng Liu",2023-04-30

Very cool to hear that this preprint was discussed as a part of a graduate course. You raised some very important and interesting points.  Here are some comments on some of them. ○ Indeed,  it would be interesting to look specifically at the BER pathway, being so vital in the repair of oxidative damage; We do have plans to look at PARP1. In the meantime we have performed sequencing and mutational analysis, which confirmed that mitochondrial H2O2 release indeed does not increase the mutation load, while H2O2 production at the histones did. We will include this in the final version of the paper. ○ We recently obtained data showing that the mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration was not impaired to presence or activation of TOM20-DAAO. So it does seem that mitochondrial function is not impaired. We will include it in the final version. ○ I also agree looking at mitochondrial DNA is just as interesting as nuclear DNA, and we are currently working on this. I will make sure that we define more clearly whether we are looking at nuclear or mitochondrial DNA in the final story. The remaining point you make are also valid.

We would like to suggest some possible improvements to be considered by the authors in this preprint stage before it becomes published in a journal. In some parts of the manuscript it is said that mRNA buffering is perfect as total mRNA concentration and even individual mRNA concentrations are invariant. We think that this is overblown. For instance, graphs in Sun et al 2013 (ref. #9; Figure 1), the variability in total mRNA may be as high as 50%. In fact, in García-Martínez et al 2004 (ref. #15; Figure 2) we published that during the carbon source change mRNA concentration changes also by a factor of 2. We wonder if this could be important for the modeling because it seems that on the advantages of the RS model is that it predicts robust buffering, contrarily to previous feedback models. The manuscript misses citation of some papers that we consider important for the field of mRNA buffering, such as Mena et al 2017 (doi: 10.1093/nar/gkx974). This paper is especially relevant because the current preprint describes in the Introduction section that total mRNA concentration is constant as the cell volume increases (refs. 19-22) but forgets to mention this piece of work, which was the first one to show that degradation rate perfectly balances production rate during cell volume change. Instead of our paper, the preprint cites ref. #27, which is 4 years older than Mena et al 2017. Garcia-Martinez et al 2023 (doi: 10.1016/j.bbagrm.2023.194910) is also highly relevant. We described in that article a mathematical model that explains mRNA buffering using a simpler mechanism consisting only one mRNA binding factor that co-transcriptionally imprints mRNAs. That model also predicts that synergistic changes in synthesis and degradation rates will provoke faster and stronger responses, as described in some experiments. We also previously published a multiagent model in Begley et al 2019 (10.1093/nar/gkz660), which combines mRNA imprinting and feedback mechanisms. That paper also demonstrates that Ccr4 and Xrn1 act in parallel with different sets of targets genes. We also have demonstrated in that paper and in other two (Begley et al 2021 doi: 10.1080/15476286.2020.1845504; and  Medina et al 2014 doi: 10.3389/fgene.2014.00001) that protein factors, such as Ccr4 and Xrn1 act not only in transcription initiation level but also in elongation . We think it would be nice this manuscript to discuss the differences of these models with the proposed RS model. Finally, as for the model in Figure 4c, we do not understand why the activation of a degron used by Chappleboim et al 2022 (ref. #16) only degrades cytoplasmic Xrn1 molecules (Xc) and leaves Xp molecules intact. All Xrn1-degron molecules (Xc, Xp, Xn) will be proteolyzed after Auxin addition. This can affect the predictions made by the RS model.",2023-08-30T08:41:17,joseeperez,Jose E Perez-Ortin,10.1101/2023.08.23.554439,Searching the mechanisms of mRNA buffering: the releasing-shuttling model,"Qirun Wang, Jie Lin",2023-08-23

By the expression of the following differential biomarkers, these populations can be divided into two: melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), cocaine, and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART); and orexin, oxytocin, and vasopressin. Excitotoxicity is commonly seen in the population of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum and is the main cause of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease. On the other hand, the nature of the neurodegenerative process found in the hypothalamus remains unknown. Thus, the author's objective was to evaluate the relationship of quinolinic acid (QA)-mediated excitotoxicity in the hypothalamic regions of wild-type and transgenic HD mouse models. Below are my comments about the work: I would like to suggest the authors to remove the term “fatal” or replace it with “progressive” in the abstract and introduction. The fatality, or lethality, results from the knockout of the huntingtin gene ( https://doi.org/10.1242/dev..., while greater numbers of CAG repetition relative to huntingtin’s mutation and homozygote allele are related to early manifestations of symptoms and several clinical courses, respectively ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/W... https://doi.org/10.1093/bra.... In the introduction, I suggest the authors to modify the phrase “Excitotoxicity, i.e., excessive stimulation of the glutamate receptor, …”, as it is glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. This is because excitotoxicity can be conceptualized as cytotoxicity caused by increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations (DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.13-05-02085.1993). Therefore, excitotoxicity can be glutamate-dependent and -independent. We can also observe excitotoxicity when calcium concentrations increase by other pathways that are independent of glutamate receptors. In both cases, there will be a loss of the cell's ability to reestablish the homeostatic balance of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0903546106). In the conclusion topic, I think that could be interesting to further exploring the data obtained from selective excitotoxicity for the MCH-positive neurons. I say this because, although there is no amplification of the QA-induced excitotoxicity effect in the transgenic animals, the observation that the same neurons (i.e., the MCH-positive neurons) naturally undergo neurodegeneration seems to me an indication that the affected neuronal populations can die by different mechanisms; being, however, the MCH-positive neuronal cell death, probably, related to the glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. Thus, the hypothesis that the MCH-positive neuronal population is selectively affected by the glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity cannot be ruled out.",2023-08-27T18:57:22,disqus_vBUn9yN5KM,Lucas Bonfim,10.1101/2023.06.20.545648,Evidence for glutamate excitotoxicity that occurs before the onset of striatal cell loss and motor symptoms in an ovine Huntington’s Disease model,"Andrew Jiang, Linya You, Renee R.

Those being Erick J. Lundgren and Rhys T. Lemoine respectively. Professor Lundgren has published rather questionable work attempting to justify the presence of invasive species by claiming may have replaced certain extinct Late Pleistocene megafauna in a 2020 paper. And Professor Lemoine published a paper in 2022 where he and a colleague gave certain invasive species terms on ""states of nativeness"". In short, both professors advocate using Pleistocene Rewilding to try making the case for invasive species around the globe, and the supposed findings of this paper are simply a way of trying to get people on board with the idea.

We are Felippe Truglio Machado and Rebeca Bueno-Alves, PhD students at the Department of Biochemistry at University of São Paulo. This article does a really good job demonstrating how mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide affects genomic DNA, with a clear and concise methodology. It puts a perspective on how we should address our concepts when we say how mitochondria oxidant production contributes toward nuclear damage, specifying if it’s a direct or indirect one, something that hasn’t been demonstrated yet. The article aimed to analyze whether hydrogen peroxide produced in mitochondria could potentially contribute directly toward nuclear DNA damage, considering the distance this species would have to travel within the cell. A highly interesting methodology for control induced hydrogen peroxide was developed based on the expression of the enzyme D-Amino Acid Oxidase (DAAO) at different sites within human cells. DAAO was anchored to the outer membrane of the mitochondria or to the nucleosomes. This method proved to be quite promising, particularly regarding its use in studies requiring more continuous or compartmentalized exposure to H2O2, as this could better mimic the physiological cell hydrogen peroxide production, instead of an exogenous burst treatment. This approach is useful for a handful of studies, especially for those focused on mitochondrial DNA integrity. Based on the presented results, the researchers were able to conclude that peroxide formed in mitochondria cannot significantly affect nuclear DNA directly, but they do not rule out the possibility of some indirect impact, warranting further studies in this regard. Although this work really is a great contribution to our current knowledge into mechanisms of oxidative nuclear damage, especially regarding the possibility of its use in future studies, it could really benefit from a different approach in some of its statements. Major comments: ●	The discussion but not in the introduction discuss oxidative DNA lesions and repair by the BER pathway. In the topic “mitochondrial H2O2 release does not induce genomic DNA damage” represented by figure 3, it would be great to assess speciafically BER proteins, which are essential for oxidized base repair. Two additional scenarios must be considered in this situation: one in which the BER pathway is synchronized and single strand breaks are being repaired by POLB as soon as they are generated by glycosylases/ape1, therefore, without much of an increase in single strand breaks. The other one in which the repair proteins are oxidized and repair is not initiated, therefore mutagenic lesions such as 8-oxoG would not impair DNA replication, not inducing cell cycle arrest, which would lead to infidelity of DNA replication instead. So, experiments focused on the BER pathway would help to substantiate the results. Suggestions include measuring OGG1, APE1, or PolB, adding them to the western blot data, or even “BER signaling proteins” such as PARP1. With the present data, we know that peroxide production from the nucleus and mitochondria can cause or not cause nuclear DNA damage (DNA strand breaks), but the mutation rate caused by these types of damage and/or by the mutagenic lesions is not determined. In sync with this line of thought, it would also be interesting to detect damage and survival in the cells after a few days to see how the possible mutations could be established and impact on cell physiology. ●	It would be important to have results that can characterize the experimental model established by the group. In the first figure, they show through the measurement of oxygen consumption that the model was effective in generating H2O2 after the addition of D-Alanine, both in the lineage expressing DAAO in the nucleosomes and in the outer mitochondrial membrane. In order to ascertain whether the addition of the DAAO enzyme with or without D-Ala, by itself, could generate an impact on mitochondrial function or non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption, a comprehensive bioenergetic characterization of the model as a whole would be really beneficial This would ensure that the observed changes are attributable to the specific impact of DAAO and not something indirect through changes in oxidative phosphorylation. ●	The paper could be really improved by adding an assessment of mitochondrial DNA. First, it’s important to differentiate the two genomes. Only nuclear DNA damage was measured, so when DNA damage is mentioned it is important to address this limitation. Second, despite having far less coding genes compared to nuclear DNA, mtDNA oxidative damage and mutation should not be excluded from the discussion. Although mt H2O2 could not contribute directly toward tumorigenesis in the nucleus as stated, it could cause mutations in mtDNA, and this could also have detrimental consequences that should be worth mentioning in the discussion. Also, since the model is already available, future studies analyzing controlled mtDNA damage and mutations caused by peroxide would be a great contribution, since mitochondrial dysfunction caused by impaired mitochondrially-encoded protein synthesis has a big impact in a plethora of disorders. The nuclear genome is of course the main character in cancer, but mtDNA should not be excluded regarding its importance in cell metabolism. Experiments such as detecting mtDNA copy number by PCR and measuring oxygen consumption using different mt complex inhibitors would add a lot to this work, and would provide an overview of H2O2 production by D-Amino Acid Oxidase DAAO impact on mitochondria. In the absence of this data, it's challenging to determine whether any alterations are due to impacts on nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. ●	Regarding the cell survival data, a clonogenic assay and a MTT assay could yield interesting insights and complement the crystal violet data presented in Figure 2. The methods used in the article assessed the effect of H2O2 after 24 hours of treatment, but it would be worthwhile to observe their impact over longer periods. Therefore, a clonogenic assay would be quite valuable to reinforce the data and allow for more comprehensive conclusions, and it also would enable to assess cell survival in a quantitative way. The MTT assay could complement this data since it can be used to analyze cell viability in a mitochondrial metabolism dependent way. ●	Regarding cell death induced by ferroptosis, it would be good if mitochondria-mediated cell death (citC/Caspase9) could be measured, and also mitophagy. Since a lot of damage is being generated in mitochondria it would be interesting to see its impact on other cell death mechanisms and mitochondrial degradation. ●	Some minor statements: ○	Figure 3A could be quantified and presented in graphs for better data visualization ○	In figure 4, the treatment time scale could be aligned to the left like the other figures instead of in the middle.",2023-08-25T18:07:39,felippe_truglio_machado,Felippe Truglio Machado,10.1101/2023.03.29.534749,Mitochondrial H2O2 release does not directly cause genomic DNA damage,"Daan M.K. van Soest, Paulien E.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.04.552078v2#comment-6263319234,biorxivstage,2,"Dear Dr. Germain, Thank you for the insightful comment on our preprint and your important contributions to the singlet detection methodologies. We have considered your response and have addressed your comments below. Comment: First, it's wrong to write that scDblFinder is ""formerly known as doubletCells"". They're two methods developed independently, and it's simply that doubletCells was moved to the same package, but still as an independent method. Response: Thank you for pointing this out. Our confusion stemmed from the fact that doubletCells kept pointing us to the scDblFinder package. Indeed, you are right in that scDblFinder and doubletCells are two different methods. We will revise the manuscript to clarify this point. Comment: Second, your results are in contrast with other benchmarks, which you explain by more ""realistic scRNA-seq datasets"". I'm obviously not entirely disinterested here, but I think this is very misleading: you don't show any evidence that the traditional benchmark datasets do have unrealistic patient or batch effects, and omit to mention the critical fact that, as far as I know, the fatemap samples are homogeneous cell lines, which is far from being more realistic (people do scRNAseq on complex tissues much more often than on cell lines). I think a fairer description would be to abandon the ""realistic/unrealistic"" labels, describe your data as it is, and hence that your observations are basically about homotypic doublets, which the tested methods are very bad at detecting (but also don't claim to do). The lack of real difference between adjacent/distant seems to indicate pretty clearly that you're essentially dealing with homotypic doublets. Response: Thank you for your thorough reading of our preprint and raising these points. First, the point on what are “realistic datasets” is well-taken as it is a subjective descriptor, and, as such, open to interpretation. We will certainly qualify our language appropriately in the revised version; I appreciate you noticing it! Second, homotypic doublets are those from transcriptionally similar cells. As a result, they manifest to different extents or spectrums in both homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets and are a problem regardless of the datasets in question. Third, as a matter of fact, not all FateMap datasets are homogenous. Some of the more heterogeneous datasets are from primary human samples and differentiated cardiomyocytes. Even for those that are homogenous, it is the starting population that is homogenous, not the eventual responses to stimuli/stress, which are quite diverse. Finally, where single-cell sequencing is more useful or implemented is open to interpretation. Of course atlases of diverse tissues and cell types have been useful and continue to be so. Beyond atlases, the continuums of cell identities and rare cell states are of particular interest in a wide-range of biological questions, from cancer to aging to stem cell therapies. We hope the community can use barcoding datasets to study differences which are outwardly subtle, yet can have profound phenotypic impact. Lastly, we do not agree with your statement on “lack of real difference”, as our data clearly shows significant performance improvement for both AUROC and AUPRC for doubletCells (Figure 2E,F). Again, our motivation for testing these methods and showing their lower than reported performance on detecting homotypic doublets is to aid users to choose the method that would work best on their dataset. We thank you for your thorough reading of our preprint, and I am happy to answer any other questions you may have. Feel free to reach me at yogesh.goyal@northwestern.edu.

This work is aimed to explore the conformation preference in LLPS especially at interface by a homopolymer model. But the dense phase has more than 1000 mg/ml concentration, it seems like a pure component polymer droplet without water, should we call it LLPS/condensates, or polymer melt? 2. From the single-chain Rg distribution, the homopolymer used in this work would collapse. From polymer field view, this polymer has bad solvent quality with exponent coefficient v<0.5 in dilute phase, but in highly concentrated polymer melt, polymer has solvent quality with exponent coefficient v=0.5, so it will expand when entering polymer melt phase. Also the interface region in your work could be viewed as semi-dilute phase. Your result is similar with what's illustrated in polymer field before. But was it suitable for LLPS? 3.

The manuscript discusses changes in body temperatures of two distinct species of nesting sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea and Eretmochelys imbricata) over a period of seven years. The experimental efforts proved to be sufficient to fulfill the research objective, with emphasis on the use of a non-invasive method, considering that these are threatened species. The manuscript is very well written with a cohesive introduction that offer adequate information allowing the reader to easily follow the discussion of the obtained results. However, two points could be better addressed: i. geographic contextualization could be described with more precision and details, and a map could be helpful for the reader; ii. a more complete discussion about the threat status of both species would be useful to contextualize the relevance of the work. Below are some comments. - Keywords: Despite being a small detail, keywords contain terms already used in the title, which is not necessary. Thus, we suggest changing these keywords: leatherback turtle, hawksbill turtle, core body temperatures, nesting. - Introduction: Addressed pertinent information that was little commented on in articles in the area about the physiology of the leatherback turtle species and its relationship with body temperature, for example, the ability of the species to maintain its body temperature above the average temperature of the ocean. - Introduction: Despite mentioning the imminent risk of extinction of these species due to the increase in average global temperature, the risk of global and local extinction of both species was not mentioned. E. imbricata is known to be critically endangered and D. coriacea is classified as vulnerable worldwield, according to the IUCN. - Study sites: As mentioned, the manuscript would benefit considerably of including a map, and mentioning the state and country of the nesting sites where the samplings took place. It could be also interesting to offer more information on the social context of the islands (e.g. are the islands protected areas? are there residents on the island?). - Measurement of core body temperatures: it would be important to give more details on sampling efforts, for example: frequency and time of monitoring. - Results: it would be interesting to add the variation in body temperature of each species of sea turtle in the result topic, as described in the article abstract, as it is an important information for the reader. - Discussion: It would be interesting to mention other possible oceanographic and climatic influences, in addition to El Niño and La Niña, such as other sea surface temperature anomalies (e.g. Atlantic Dipole).

In the study titled “Toxinome - The Bacterial Protein Toxin Database”, Danov et al. developed a publicly accessible website compiling the information on bacterial toxins and antitoxins from all available species from five distinct databases (SecRet6, BactiBase, TADB, BAGEL, UniProt). This system offers user-friendly browsing options, enabling users to explore the compiled data by organism or by Pfam code. Additionally, the website incorporates advanced search tools allowing searches based on amino acid sequences or specific keywords like product name, organism name, Pfam ID, and Pfam name. A particularly intriguing observation of the dataset was the identification of ‘Toxin Islands’, genomic regions that encode multiple toxins and/or antitoxins. These Toxin Islands not only provide information about known toxins but also serve as indicators of potential unidentified toxins within these genomic regions. The paper demonstrates the utility of this concept by providing an example where a hypothetical protein encoded within a Toxin Island exhibits structural similarities to a known toxin. Although the creation of the database and website is quite impressive, the compiled information could have been further explored. Major comments 1.	What specific analysis ensures that the domains present in the database truly belong to toxins and are not false positives? A search solely based on the ""toxin/toxic"" word through InterPro might have introduced many false positives. Furthermore, was there a previous quality check for the proteins imported from each database to ensure they were actually toxins? It is possible that false-positive toxins were included from the original datasets. One example is the structural protein Hcp from the T6SS (annotated in the SecReT6) gene id: 2503566284, which is depicted as a toxin, but the predicted protein does not encode any toxic domains. There are several examples of Hcp domain encoding proteins in the dataset that probably present only structural functions. In line 150, ""The resulting dataset was then manually curated for quality assurance, and toxin or antitoxin genes erroneously included were removed”. Could you please elaborate on the procedure of this manual analysis? What specific criteria were employed to identify and eliminate false positives? This information is crucial to ensure the reliability of the identified toxins and antitoxins. 2.	A more comprehensive discussion of the existing databases would greatly enhance the work. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the total number of proteins present in each database and highlight any intersection between them. This additional information will provide a clearer picture of the data's scope and contribute overall credibility of the analysis. 3.	Although the analysis of toxin presence in bacteria living across varying temperature ranges does yield intriguing insights into the evolution of extremophiles, this aspect appears distant from the central topic of the work and offers a relatively superficial analysis. It would also be interesting to include other information: 1) what is the toxin distribution by habitat type and hosts; despite being a well-studied area, this association would lend support to the dataset's intrinsic conclusion; 2) target specificity and protein domains, what is the frequency of toxins targeting specific cellular components (lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, metabolites) based on protein domains (Pfam); 3) what is the toxin diversity among different phylogenetic groups; figure 6 explores this aspect to some extent, however, the toxin types (domains) are not mentioned. 4.	The concept of Toxin Islands is crucial to the study and could be explored more deeply. While Figure 6 focuses on the topic, only the toxin and antitoxin counts are provided. Details about toxin types within each island could be valuable. An observation is highlighted regarding the Bacilli class, whether a higher toxin count than the antitoxin count is observed. The hypothesis in the discussion part suggests that Bacilli may have an abundance of toxins targeting eukaryotes, potentially explaining the lower need for antitoxins. This hypothesis could be further investigated using the Toxinome data itself. 5.	The work uses protein structural prediction tools to examine the specific case of  unannotated toxin and antitoxin found in the Toxin Island of Thauera phenylacetica B4P (Figure 7). It would be beneficial to the work to highlight other examples. Minor comments 1.	Figure 2 appears to be very complex, leading to difficulties in following the numerical sequence. This figure could be separated into Panels A and B. 2.	In Figure 3, consider providing annotations for Archaea species. Additionally, indicate on the phylogenetic tree the specific bacterial clades that have a depletion of toxins and antitoxins. 3.	There is no reference to a figure or table in line 285: ""As we expect, there is a high correlation between toxin and anti-toxin content (R = 0.6581, pvalue = 7.59x10-13)"". 4.	There is no reference to a figure/table/supplementary material to line 143:  ""To increase the number of toxins and  immunity proteins into our database we used protein domain information. We added 219 and 94 toxin and antitoxin domains, respectively, to the resulting toxin gene set that we downloaded from the Pfam database."". 5.	The data present in Tables 1-4 could be effectively visualized using graphs, which would enhance the clarity and comprehension of the information. 6.	In the discussion (line 440): ""For example, certain hyperthermophilic and halophilic Archaea were described to produce bacteriocins called sulfolobicins and halocins, respectively"". It would be interesting to know if the authors could find these toxins in the compiled Toxinome dataset",2023-08-22T17:11:14,,Stephanie Sibinelli,10.1101/2023.08.12.553073,Toxinome - The Bacterial Protein Toxin Database,"Aleks Danov, Ofir Segev, Avi Bograd, Yedidya Ben Eliyahu, Noam Dotan, Tommy Kaplan, Asaf Levy",2023-08-12

I was delighted to come across your article, and the experience of reading it has been truly remarkable. It has been a rewarding endeavor to contemplate potential alternatives and novel experiments that could further enhance the significance of your work. I hope that you receive this message and find value in these collaborative insights. The lncRNA Sweetheart regulates compensatory cardiac hypertrophy after myocardial injury. In the elegant study by Rogala et al., they demonstrated that the expression of the long non-coding RNA ""sweetheart RNA"" (Swhtr), which is expressed in the same region as the crucial transcription factor Nkx2-5, exerts favorable effects on both cardiac function and morphology in animals subjected to left anterior descending artery ligation (LAD). The Swhtr lncRNA is chromatin-localized, and although its deletion does not induce cardiac structural changes during embryonic phases or fetal lethality, nor yield structural or functional cardiac modifications in adulthood, its recovery in transgenic animals induced an enhancement in cardiac morphology and function following myocardial infarction induced by LAD surgery. Although its precise function remains undefined, this manuscript suggests its influence on genes associated with the NKX2-5 transcription factor. Major 1- I found the introduction to be quite engaging. However, enhancing the overall coherence of the work could involve establishing a more explicit connection between collagen deposition, scar formation, and fibrosis within the context of a myocardial infarction model. Addressing this interrelationship in the introduction would be particularly advantageous, given its enduring significance over time, as opposed to the relatively less prevalent occurrence of compensatory hypertrophy. 2- In the study conducted by Werber et al. (2014), the group generated a comprehensive dataset elucidating the transcriptional landscape of cardiac tissue. Notably, they identified a specific RNA molecule that exhibits exclusive expression within the heart tissue context. Conversely, in the context of the present research, the rationale behind investigating the lncRNA Swhtr appears to lack clarity Establishing a logical connection with the Nkx2-5 factor could potentially serve to justify the selection of the lncRNA under investigation. This strategic link could bolster the rationale for studying lncRNA Swhtr and its potential relevance within the broader context of cardiac biology. 3- I appreciate the researchers' elegant approach in illustrating the spatial distribution of lncRNA across diverse embryonic stages. Nevertheless, I am left wondering whether the researchers considered expanding their analysis to encompass additional developmental stages, such as the newborn (NB) phase. This query stems from the findings highlighted in the current study, where the NB phase emerges as the highest lncRNA window expression and, conceivably, a pivotal period of heightened lncRNA activity (Bridges et al., 2021; Gomes et al., 2017). Remarkably, this pattern aligns with the outcomes derived from Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) analyses conducted on cultured cardiac cells (Fig. 1H). Thus, contemplating lncRNA dynamics during the newborn phase could offer valuable insights into its plausible functional roles and accentuate its significance within the intricate framework of cardiac biology. 4- In figures 3A-F, the inclusion of a Sham WT control group would be highly valuable. While I recognize the challenges associated with conducting additional experiments for a new group, the incorporation of Sham animals could substantially enhance the interpretability of the results. Specifically, the comparison between disease-induced (LAD) effects on both WT and KO (Swhtr3x/pA3xpA) groups and their corresponding Sham WT counterparts would offer insightful insights into survival rates and cardiac function data. For instance, the introduction of a Sham WT group could illuminate noteworthy differences in ejection fraction. It is conceivable that the KO animals subjected to LAD would exhibit a potentially significant reduction in ejection fraction when contrasted with the healthy Sham WT group. In contrast, both the WT and Transgenic animals may not display statistically significant deviations from the Sham WT group, thereby accentuating the therapeutic benefits conferred by the treatment. Incorporating a Sham WT control group would contribute significantly to the robustness of the findings, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of the treatment's efficacy and its impact on cardiac function under both normal and disease conditions. 5- I believe that a more comprehensive characterization of the animals subjected to LAD would greatly enrich the study. Showing fibrosis and hypertrophy could lead to more holistic understanding of the animals' phenotype. Also, presenting the expressions of specific collagen types, particularly collagen III, which typically manifests in the initial weeks following an infarction, would help. This additional analysis would provide a deeper insight into the fibrotic response triggered by the myocardial infarction and contribute to a comprehensive appreciation of the tissue remodeling process. Furthermore, the inclusion of molecular markers associated with cardiac hypertrophy would be a significant asset to the study. 6- Extending the observation period for animals subjected to LAD and tracking them until the development of heart failure would offer a comprehensive perspective on morphological and functional cardiac changes over time. This longitudinal approach holds the promise of uncovering the dynamic role of the identified lncRNA in disease progression, providing valuable insights into its potential as a modulator or indicator of pathological processes associated with heart failure. 7- An elegant dimension could be added to the study if the researchers were to explore the effects of lncRNA Swthr deletion and gain of function in alternate models of hypertrophy. Considering the potential role of this lncRNA in governing cardiac hypertrophy, examining its impact on both pathological and physiological hypertrophic scenarios could yield valuable insights. Employing the transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model for inducing pathological hypertrophy would provide a robust hypertrophic stimulus, while unveiling the lncRNA's effects in physiological hypertrophy through aerobic exercise sessions would establish a nuanced connection between hypertrophy modulation and lncRNA activity. By encompassing these distinct scenarios, the study could present a comprehensive perspective on lncRNA's role in different hypertrophic contexts, thereby enhancing our understanding of its regulatory influence on cardiac adaptation. 8- The utilization of cardiac tissue culture is indeed an intriguing aspect of the study. Expanding this approach, perhaps in future studies, to encompass diverse infarction zones, including border and remote areas, would not only enhance the study's sophistication but also provide invaluable insights into the nuanced RNA profile characteristics of distinct zones adapting to the pathological stimulus. Moreover, performing an RNA expression profile analysis within the hearts of transgenic animals subjected to LAD holds promise in uncovering potential gene alterations and regulatory effects mediated by the lncRNA. This multifaceted exploration could unravel a comprehensive landscape of gene expression changes triggered by the lncRNA, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of its intricate role in the cardiac response to myocardial infarction. Minor - I believe it would be important to use Medical Subject Headings for the keywords, I suggest: Cardiac hypertrophy, long non-coding RNA, myocardial infarction. - In figures 1C-E the researchers interestingly use the lacZ reporter technique. It would be interesting and necessary to present the technique used in the methods. - The sentence to describe Swhtr labeling in heart and other tissue was a bit confusing and could be improved in clarity (line 199-122). - In Figure 1F, I believe there was a significant difference; if possible, provide the statistical symbol. Also in figure F, did the authors use any housekeeping gene to correct the expression? I think it would be more interesting to show the relative expression versus the absolute. - During the manuscript, Swhtr and Swhtr lncRNA are used, I particularly think the name followed by lncRNA is more elegant. - I believe that if the 1G figure were presented with separate bars, it will make the result much easier to understand. - I believe it would make the text easier to understand if 3G figure were moved to position 3B - It would be very interesting to demonstrate in figure 3H, in addition to the knock-out and Tg, also the LAD surgery and the time course. - Line 218, I think you addressed the wrong image (is it 3G?). - In the methods it would be important to define the term ES cells and mESCs (Embryonic stem cells) (line 342); Line 415, 465, 466, 467 use qPCR as in the rest of manuscript. It would be important to state in the manuscript how much tissue or cells were used for RNA extraction. It would also be nice to tell in the body of the text the time it took to extract the tissues, they are described in the methods, but I believe that it would enhance the work by being close to the results.

The manuscript ""Adaptation of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Transcriptome to Biofilm Growth"" delves into the intricate variations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transcription patterns. It uncovers disparities between the ancestral L4 strains and those exposed to selective pressure for biofilm formation. This previously unexplored phenomenon holds potential insights into host interactions, making it a compelling avenue for comprehending disease pathogenesis. MAJOR POINTS: ** This preprint represents a continuation of the research group's prior study published in 2022. Within this work, the researchers skillfully leverage transcriptomics techniques to illuminate the intricate irregularities that govern biofilm formation in mycobacteria. The employed methodologies not only establish a robust foundation but also showcase a meticulously outlined methodology. However, it's noteworthy that the text's structure occasionally reintroduces specific passages in both the results and recommendations sections. A potential benefit to the text could be achieved by addressing and eliminating these redundancies. ** The introduction and discussion lack information describing mycobacteria and biofilms in general. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), for example, are well described in terms of their ability to form biofilm. These environmental and opportunistic organisms represent a problem for water treatment systems and in the hospital environment. ** The discussion about phenotypic variation is superficially described. A more thorough discussion of this phenomenon can contribute to the findings. ** As described, MMMC duplication has already been observed by other authors. Under which growth conditions has this been seen? Does this corroborate or contrast from the point of view of biofilm formation? ** The origin of the strains is not exactly clear. The strains chosen deserve a brief description of the patients from whom they were collected and their pathogenesis. In addition, was any characterization performed on the resistance profile of the strains? The relationship between biofilms and susceptibility should be further explored.

The study analyses genome-wide DNA methylation and differential gene expression in the initial generation (heat-stressed and control) and their three subsequent non-stressed asexual generations. The authors observed a decreasing transfer of the stress-induced molecular memory across the generations. Their work has originality/novelty, and we believe the biological question they seek to answer can be interesting for the plant sciences community. We would like to provide some suggestions which we believe might enhance the quality of the manuscript. Please be aware that these suggestions are not exhaustive. Major comments •	Please include additional information so as to allow the research to be replicable and reproducible. For example, saying “9:00-11:00 a.m.” might not be precise enough. Using the specific light zeitgeber would better inform when samples were harvested in the diel cycle (lines 140 and 161). Another example, the description “Illumina paired end read sequencing (150 bp)” appears to omit crucial details concerning the specific options utilised in the NGS experiment. Important information, such as mRNA selection method, library construction kit, sequencing platform, and the strand-specificity of reads, among other factors, should be included. Line 192: Please state which transcriptome was used with Salmon. Line 282: Which clustering method was used to build the heatmaps? •	The claim that “… genes linked to gibberellin pathways may contribute to a short transcriptional memory.” should be discussed with the literature. •	Line 642-644: Kindly review the claim in relation to what is depicted in the figure. Minor comments •	We recommend English editing to enhance grammar and clarity. •	Scientific names must always be italicised. In the first appearance of the species, it is also required to list the person (or team) who first made the scientific name of that taxon available. •	Lines 131, 134 and 144: could you please add the light intensity in µmol m-2 s-1? •	Line 135: Is there a specific scientific or practical rationale for maintaining consistent temperatures in stress assays throughout both day and night, while implementing varying diel thermos-cycles for control and recovery conditions? •	Line: 158: We found it a bit difficult to understand what was actually collected. •	Line 166: please, add the reference where we can find more details on the bisulfide method used. •	Line 193: It would make it easier for the reader to understand what the authors mean by DEG if the DESeq2 default parameters were described here. Is it log-fold change, p-value cut-off, etc? •	Lines 205-207: Could you provide information on the duration of the heat-stress treatments? •	Lines 264-267: Do terms like ""low,"" ""hypermethylation,"" and ""hypomethylation"" refer to a comparison with data from control samples? The comparison between different samples was not really clear to us. The same applies to “significantly different” (line 281). •	Figure 1A: We think this figure could be improved to help the reader understand the temperatures used for CM. Additionally, could you confirm whether the application of 24°C on recovery days precisely occurred for 48 hours? It seems that the temperature might not be exactly 24°C, and we think the figure could provide more precise details. •	Figure 1B: Why are scissors, “2w” and “sampling” shown only on the right-hand side of the figure? •	Figure 1C: Detecting differences among samples based on the y-axis is proving to be challenging for us. The authors might want to contemplate plotting by C contexts on the x-axis, or alternatively, segmenting the y-axis into three distinct regions where resolution could be enhanced around 1-5, 13-17, and 38-42. •	Figure 3B: Is it possible to apply colour shading similar to that seen in a heatmap for this figure? •	Figure 3D: Kindly review the genes mentioned in the figure legend in relation to what is depicted in the figure. •	Line 280-281: The phrase between the brackets seems a bit confusing. We recommend rephrasing it for clarity. •	It might be advisable for the authors to verify whether they are employing a colour-blind-friendly palette. •	Some of the finer details in the figures are quite challenging to discern, making it difficult to interpret the results. •	The expression patterns of several FvHSFs were described previously (López et al., 2022), some also undergoing promoter demethylation. How does the expression patterns of these HSFs change in response to a temperature gradient challenge? We believe the paper would considerably improve if heat-shock proteins and chaperones are also investigated.",2023-08-21T17:16:09,cristianepaulagomescalixto,Cristiane Paula Gomes Calixto,10.1101/2023.05.26.542514,Epigenetic and transcriptional landscape of heat-stress memory in woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca),"María-Estefanía López, Béatrice Denoyes, Etienne Bucher",2023-05-29

First, it's wrong to write that scDblFinder is ""formerly known as doubletCells"". They're two methods developed independently, and it's simply that doubletCells was moved to the same package, but still as an independent method. Second, your results are in contrast with other benchmarks, which you explain by more ""realistic scRNA-seq datasets"". I'm obviously not entirely disinterested here, but I think this is very misleading: you don't show any evidence that the traditional benchmark datasets do have unrealistic patient or batch effects, and omit to mention the critical fact that, as far as I know, the fatemap samples are homogeneous cell lines, which is far from being more realistic (people do scRNAseq on complex tissues much more often than on cell lines). I think a fairer description would be to abandon the ""realistic/unrealistic"" labels, describe your data as it is, and hence that your observations are basically about homotypic doublets, which the tested methods are very bad at detecting (but also don't claim to do). The lack of real difference between adjacent/distant seems to indicate pretty clearly that you're essentially dealing with homotypic doublets.",2023-08-16T13:06:21,pierrelucgermain,Pierre-Luc Germain,10.1101/2023.08.04.552078,singletCode: synthetic barcodes identify singlets in scRNA-seq datasets and evaluate doublet algorithms,"Ziyang Zhang, Madeline E.

Preface: We thank the reviewers for their interest in our work and for the thoughtful, clearly-organized, and fair feedback. Besides increasing the reproducibility and rigor of our work, the points raised by the reviewers led us to explore previously-overlooked aspects of our study, revealing new insights with significant implications for future studies. In a field that moves at a break-neck pace, this form of feedback is invaluable for optimizing the rate of discovery and the accuracy of the findings. In this response, we address each of the major points raised in the review. We reference a set of figures and a table that were prepared to address points raised by the reviewers. Unfortunately, these figures cannot be shared in text-only forms, but we have hosted them in a public repository, accessible at this link: https://github.com/GMdSilva..., which also includes all the raw data referenced in this response. Response: Major points: 1.0. The MSA subsampling approach that the authors have adapted in this work has been used by others previously (as cited by the authors themselves), albeit with some modifications. So it is important to see if the existing methodologies, for instance the DBSCAN based clustering and MSA subsampling by Wayment-Steele et al., are able to predict these relative state populations of variants. R: We agree that these comparisons would be important, especially in the context of benchmarking and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Although we thought of running a few comparisons with the DBSCAN method, we ultimately decided to focus our study on showcasing the results of our approach in the context of the two test cases instead of as a comparison with previous methods. We are very curious to see how our results line up with results from alternative methods and are happy to assist other groups with further studies by sharing our data or running predictions. 1.1. Also, the optimization of max_seq:extra_seq requires quite a bit of pre-existing experimental information. How is this method to be applied for a relatively new system? The authors could also provide some guidelines on how the max_seq:extra_seq numbers to be sampled are c0hosen and in general comment about the hyper-parameter space in their approach and how it compares to other schemes/approaches. R: This is an excellent point, which could have been more thoroughly addressed in our current manuscript and will be in subsequent versions. While our approach is best suited for the high-throughput exploration of the effects of changes in previously-explored systems, we argue that our method can also stud mostly unknown (in the context of structural or dynamics data) systems. To accomplish this, a user should first identify structural elements with significant conformational variation within the predicted ensemble (such as by calculating the root mean square fluctuation of alpha carbons within the ensemble when aligned with the prediction of the highest-ranking pLDDT, or more easily by evaluating per-residue pLDDT values, as lower pLDDT values are usually correlated with increased dynamics, see Figure 1’A for an example of this correlation.) Following that, the user could plot the RMSD of that specific region for each prediction with respect to the highest-ranking (by average pLDDT) reference, and either analyze the distribution visually or via statistical methods. This approach works exceptionally well for Abl1. The A-loop is the structural element with the largest amplitude of conformational changes in the ensemble, as evidenced in Figure 1’A. By plotting the A-Loop backbone RMSD with respect to the top-ranked prediction for each prediction within the Abl1 ensemble, we clearly identify patterns across the parameter optimization process. Specifically, we see that the distributions of predictions as a function of RMSD are similar and cluster around the ground state for the most extreme parameter values (32:64 and 2048:4096), but become increasingly wider and more diverse for intermediate parameter values(256:512 and 512:1024), where we observe an increased number of samples around 14 A. For Abl1, we already know the implications of these observations in regards to its structure and function, but in the absence of previous information, it would be reasonable to infer that the cluster at ~14 A represents a metastable conformation of lower population than the ground state and that the predictions that lie in-between them (more diverse in 256:512 and 512:1024) could represent low-occupancy intermediate states. Consequently, in systems for which there is limited information, choosing parameters that lead to the widest distribution of configurations and the largest number of intermediate predictions between two or more states of interest should lead to optimal results, without the need for experimental data. 2.0. Apart from the large change in A-loop from active to inactive state in Abl kinase, the other important structure change involves the 𝛼C helix moving out (as shown in Reference 22 cited in the preprint). The authors have not discussed this aspect. Does the AF2 subsampled ensemble reflect the change in the helix position? R: We agree with the reviewers that looking at aC helix conformations is important, and regret that we neglected it when writing the original manuscript. In response to this suggestion, we calculated the RMSD of the aC Helix backbone (residues 275-295) with respect to both the Ground and I2 state references (6XR6 and 6XRG, respectively) for each ensemble of wild-type Abl1 predictions at different subsampling labels, in the same way we did for the activation loop and plotted the results in figure 2’A. Importantly, we see a distribution of results that is strikingly similar to the activation loop results (Figure 1’A). When plotting these variables against each other (Figure 2’B), we observe clear clustering corresponding to Ground-like and I2-like states, suggesting that AF2 is not predicting just the activation loop conformational changes, but the aC-helix movement as well. This pattern holds for mutant forms of Abl1 (mutations that decrease the ground state population lead to predictions with increased aC-Helix motions and an increased frequency of predictions different than the ground state;an opposite effect is observed for those that increase the ground state population, as summarized in Figure 2’B). In summary, our approach accurately identifies that aC-Helix and A-loop motions are correlated in our ensemble of predictions, and can be used individually or in tandem to distinguish between conformational states. 2.1. The snapshots shown from enhanced MD does not seem to show this change either (upon visual examination of the snapshots shown in the figures). Hence, the biological relevance of the MD simulation becomes questionable. R: We thank the reviewers for bringing this to our attention. We do observe the aC-Helix shifting from its initial position in our simulations, but due to a labeling error while making Figure 4 of the original manuscript, we miscommunicated the scope of our results, leading to the impression that there is no change in the aC-Helix position (which is also not helped by the camera angle of the structural renderings we included in the figure, which makes it hard to discern changes in the helix position). As described in the supporting information, we ran two separate enhanced-sampling simulations using the Weighted Ensemble method to determine the timescales of the Ground to  I2 transition. This led to two representative trajectories: Simulation I spanning 13 ns corresponding to the Ground to I1 (DFG flip) transition, and Simulation II spanning 24 ns corresponding to the I1 to I2 (A-Loop collapse) transition. In Figure 4, we took snapshots from the I1 to I2 state simulation (in contrast with the Ground to I2 simulation, as erroneously labeled in the paper), since the activation loop transition happens within that interval. At 0 ns for simulation II, the aC-Helix is already slightly shifted with respect to its ground state position, as some of the aC-Helix conformational change happens in the Ground to I1 transition. Since the shown snapshots are all from the I1 to I2 transition, Figure 4 in the manuscript doesn’t accurately communicate aC-Helix conformational changes. We will remedy this oversight by adjusting the language in the figure and related discussions in the text. Further, for the sake of clarity, we demonstrate in Figure 3 that our collated trajectory (II appended to the end of I) captures the aC-Helix moving away from the kinase core. We have also updated the original plots to include the entire 37 ns simulation (Figure 3’B). Lastly, we also noticed an error regarding the time points at which snapshots were collected and adjusted the vertical bars to represent the actual time points from which they were taken. We will rework Figure 4 with the correct timestamp labels for each snapshot in a future version of the manuscript. For the sake of transparency, our collated trajectory (solvent and ions removed) is available at https://github.com/GMdSilva..., and the topology at: https://github.com/GMdSilva.... 3. The authors haven’t performed statistical analyses on the RMSD comparisons or the CSP comparisons of GMCSF to claim the differences to be significant or not. For example, the authors say their approach has worked “as the range of the distribution of RMSDs of residues 80-90 and 110-125 is significantly larger for most of the mutations tested at both of these sites”. What is this distribution of RMSD compared against? Are these differences statistically significant? R: We thank the reviewers for bringing this to our attention and realize in hindsight that the text could be clearer regarding this comparison. We are comparing to the wild-type prediction that looks the most like the ground state, defined as the conformation occupied by PDB ID: 1CSG. We used the Kruskal-Wallis H-test to measure the significance of the differences we observe in the GMCSF distributions and report them in Table ‘1. This test was chosen because it is unlikely that RMSD values will follow a normal distribution considering the nature of energy landscapes (which are more likely to exhibit multimodal distributions). These results line up with our previous observations: the H83Y predictions led to statistically insignificant differences, while the H87 mutations lead to differences that are orders of magnitude less significant than H83 or H15 mutations. The H83N mutation also led to changes that are not as statistically significant as those induced by H83R, matching the observed NMR results. The raw data used in the Kruskal-Wallis H-test is available at: https://github.com/GMdSilva... 4. Given that GMCSF has very limited sequence data in MSA to start with, does MSA subsampling actually help? The authors could try doing predictions using the traditional AF2 pipeline and compare those distributions against their approach. R: Although this is not made clear in our results, we did run GMCSF without subsampling, and show the results in Figure S8. Specifically, since the length of the GMCSF MSA is only about 120 sequences, any of the subsampling runs with max_seq and extra_seq values greater than 120 are, in essence, using the traditional AF2 pipeline (with drop-offs enabled) as there is no subsampling employed. We still included these results for the sake of transparency, but in a future version of this manuscript, we will be clearer about this distinction and what it means with respect to the effects of subsampling. Minor points: 1. Although the authors are right in looking for only the ground and I2 states in Abl kinase predictions, it will be interesting to explore if there were any predictions that matched the I1 state and if not, to speculate why more extensively R. Originally, when conceptualizing this study, we did look at I1 state similarities, but the results were inconclusive and hard to make sense of, so we dropped that from the scope of the work. However, when looking at the data now, it is clear that AF2 is predicting I1-like elements in each ensemble, although the resolution of those predictions is significantly lower than that for the I2 predictions. Specifically, the I1 state is mostly defined by a flip of the position of the side chains of D381 and F382, part of the DFG motif. In the ground state, D381 points towards the active site and F382 points towards the aC-Helix, allowing productive phosphorylation. In the I1 state, these side-chain positions are inverted, and F382 occludes the active site. Previous studies have shown that two dihedrals clearly distinguish between the four potential permutations of the DFG motif side-chain orientations: D in/F in (DFG in), D out/F out (DFG out), D out/F in (DFG up), and D in/F out (DFG down). The dihedrals are defined as follows: Dihedral 1: A380CB/A380CA/D381CA/D381/CG Dihedral 2: A380CB/A380CA/F382CA/F382/CG In the Ground to I1 transition, dihedrals 1 and 2 invert. The DFG up and DFG down configurations are short-lived in Abl1 and are usually only observed in MD simulations (where femtosecond resolution is feasible). When plotting dihedrals 1 and 2 for our ensemble of predictions (Figure 4’), we observe a curious behavior for dihedral 1: the distribution is strongly bimodal, with two clearly-defined clusters, one at the expected position for dihedral 1 in the Ground state, and one much less populated cluster situated around 20-40 degrees. Although the latter is nowhere near the values expected of the dihedral 1 position in I2 (about -120 to -140), the fact that there is clustering at this position and that the cluster populations mimic that of the Ground and I1/I2 populations suggests that AF2 is picking up some amount of dynamical signal that corresponds to the Ground to I1 transition, although the signal is not strong enough and/or AF2’s resolution is not high enough to correctly replicate the expected result. Even more interestingly, the population of this D “out” cluster is increased in mutations known to dislocate the conformational equilibrium away from the ground state and decreased in mutations known to have the opposite effect (although with very low statistical power), similar to what is observed in the A-Loop or aC-Helix conformational predictions (Figure 5’). This suggests that the dihedral 1 position is correlated with A-loop and aC-Helix conformations in the predictions, which is in agreement with the defining elements of the I1 and I2 states. Finally, analyzing the distribution of dihedral 2 leads to significantly murkier results, as the swarm plot takes a comet form with a single largely-populated cluster at the expected values for the F-in conformation, and a few predictions that deviate from it up to -160 (which is also significantly far from the expected F-out values of 40 to 60). Interestingly, the population of the “outlier” predictions negatively correlates with the ground state population for the Abl1 allelic series. These results hint that there could be more coevolutional signal for the D381 flip than for the F382 flip, which corroborates MD simulation results that show that it is mostly D381 interactions that drive the entire DFG flip. 2. The data on some of the max_seq:extra_seq optimizations discussed for Abl kinase is missing. For example, 512:8 or 8:1024 R: The text is supposed to say 32:512 and 512:32 (matching Figure 5), but we neglected to change placeholder values for the data that were included in a previous figure. 3. There is no citation provided for the single and double mutants whose relative ground state populations were tested for Abl Kinase. R: The relevant citation is #22: Xie, T., Saleh, T., Rossi, P. & Kalodimos, C. G. Conformational states dynamically populated by a kinase determine its function. Science 370 (Oct. 2020). We reference it in this specific context in the caption of Figure 6: “(B) A series of point mutations in wild-type Abl1 are known to increase or decrease the relative population of the enzyme’s active (ground) state [22].” We will add a reference to the main text and to Figure S2 for improved clarity. 4. The nature of these mutations on Abl Kinase is not discussed. Are some of these mutations pathogenic or drug-resistant? It will be interesting to correlate the nature of mutation with its structural effects. The authors could provide more introduction of how these mutations were identified and add more discussion on trends. R: Three of the mutations that increase the ground-state population are associated with type II inhibitor resistance in Abl1 (E255K, T315I, E255K+T315I). All mutations were chosen due to the extensive data regarding their effects on the populations of the Ground or I2 state (Kalodimos et al., Science 2020; Kern et al, PNAS 2020). We agree with the reviewers that correlating the nature of mutations with structural effects has important implications, especially in the case of the mutations that lead to drug resistance. Our running hypothesis is that reduced affinity to type II inhibitors is caused by the further stabilization of the Ground state caused by the mutations E255K, T315I, and E255K+T315I, as type II inhibitors have a strong preference for the I2 form of Abl1. We will discuss these implications in more detail in a revised version of the manuscript. 5. What is the rationale behind choosing the PCs mentioned by the authors for Abl kinase enhanced sampling? R: Ground to I1 simulation: PC1:  Based on the observation by the D. E. Shaw Research group that protonated D381 forms a transient hydrogen bond with V299 in an unbiased DFG flip (Shaw et al., PNAS 2009). PC2.  Based on a metadynamics collective variable used in a DFG flip study of the Aurora Kinase B (Li et al, AAPS J. 2019). This PC2 allows for differentiation between DFG-out and DFG-up (PC1 is not sufficient for that, although it is sufficient to sample the flip). I1 to I2 simulation: PC1: Chosen based on visual inspection of two atoms defining a distance that should increase during the I1 to I2 transition. PC2: Chosen based on visual inspection of two atoms defining a distance that should decrease during the I1 to I2 transition. 6. Why have the authors not shown the RMSD distribution of Distance 2 in Figure 4C? R: We made the decision to not show the distribution of the Distance 2 deltas in Figure 4C because the resulting plot was cluttered when using the same figure aesthetics as the other distributions (Figure 6’), and we thought it to be largely redundant considering the other elements in the figure. We included the Distance 2 delta data in its entirety in Figures S2-5. 7. How were the mutations on the histidine triad of GMCSF chosen? Sebollela et al. 2005 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih..., which is not cited in this paper specifically but cited in one of the papers (Cui et al. 2020 - https://doi.org/10.1021/acs... that this paper cites, substitutes H15 with alanine to demonstrate a decrease in heparin affinity R: The mutations were chosen based on sequence conservation data of GMCSF. Specifically, positions 15, 83, and 87 are mostly conserved as histidine, but some species tolerate mutations to asparagine, arginine, or tyrosine. We did not test the alanine substitution as that leads to a protein with poor expression. 8. For the GMCSF system, do the authors see a relationship between the plDDT scores and the extent of RMSD? R: Yes. We are conducting further measurements for a potential follow-up study, but predictions that significantly deviate from the ground state reference have significantly lower average pLDDTs than those that mostly replicate the ground state. The amplitude of this change is reduced for some mutations, which we hypothesize is due to the alternative-conformation-stabilizing effect of these mutations. 9. Prior work that uses AF2 to sample conformational ensembles has seen that AF2 is able to predict more diverse conformations when the protein is not part of AF2’s training dataset. Was GMSCF part of the training dataset? If yes, how would the author’s approach vary for a protein that is not part of the training dataset? R: Yes. GMCSF is a part of the training dataset as the crystal structures that were solved for it were deposited before 2018 (1CSG, 2GMF, 5C7X, among others). We are measuring/honing our approach in proteins that were not part of the training dataset and will publish the results in a public repository once this analysis is finished. 10. Some of the figures are not informative/important enough to be main figures. For example, Figure 2 is mainly the AF2 pipeline, Figure 5 is just a pictorial representation of Supplementary Table S1. Also, Figures 6 and 7 could be combined into a single figure. R: We agree with this assessment and will remove redundancies in a future version of this manuscript. 11. The CSP data for H15N is not shown in Figure 9B whereas its RMSD is shown in Figure 9C R: There is no CSP data for H15N at the time of publication of the pre-print or of this review response, because of challenges with expressing this mutant. We made the decision to include the prediction data for the sake of transparency and completeness. Accordingly, we don’t make any assessments regarding the precision of the H15N predictions and don’t count them when calculating accuracy rates. We will upload an amended version of Figure 9 when GMSCF H15N data is collected. Figure 9B compares the RMSD of each mutant ensemble to the wild-type, ground state structure. 12. The cut-off values used for jackhmmer not mentioned. R: We used the default jackhmmr Significance E-values as cut-off values (0.01 for Sequence, 0.03 for hit). 13. Residues are being addressed as codons in some places in the text R: We will fix these inconsistencies in a future version of this manuscript. 14. The authors may also want to include a few sentences contrasting their approach with this recently posted work: https://www.biorxiv.org/con... in the introduction or discussion. R: Agreed, especially given the similarity of the systems tested. We will discuss this study and how our works relate to it in a future version of this manuscript. References: 1.

Actually, the probes were presented continuously starting 850-450ms prior to saccade onset (assuming ~150ms saccade preparation time) all the way to 500ms after saccade landing (schematic in Fig 1C). During this entire period, Gabor probes were presented every 16ms at one of 13x13 locations spanning the RF and potential remapped locations (Fig 1D). All the analyses in Figs 2 and 3 are shown as a function of probe onset relative to saccade onset. We are certainly aware of your very nice study in eLife. In our study, we wanted to eliminate as much as possible any anticipatory effects by introducing the spatial (one of two spatial locations) and temporal (300-500ms after the acquisition of fixation) uncertainly of the saccade target. One important thing to bear in mind is that the results we report here are from one visual cortical area. I am willing to bet that these dynamics will vary along the visual hierarchy. The impact at a perceptual level will certainly reflect the net effect of hierarchical processing.

This comment relates to the methodology and my personal experience. Essentially, I have a number of data types (SNP Chip, Exome, Illumina Whole Genome Sequencing, and PacBio HiFi Whole Genome Sequencing for myself).  You can see part of those results if you scroll down to "" Raw Re-Analysis for HLA Typing"" on this page. My HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C (which I believe are the "" class I"" HLA genes) had consistent results that I believe can be reliable. However, at least for myself, I had concerns about the SNP chip imputations for HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 (which I believe are the "" class II"" HLA genes).  The Introduction and Supplemental Tables have HLA-DRB1 results, and that is part of why I wanted to post this comment. If I am correctly understanding that this paper makes noticeable use of SNP chip imputations, then I have the following questions: 1) If I do a quick literature search, I think my own results may be consistent with Pappas et al. 2018 (but perhaps less so with Karnes et al. 2017).  While I had to learn more about HLA/MHC genes, I think it may make sense that it should be easier to make assignments for some genes over others.  Do you agree or disagree with that conclusion? 2) I thought SNP2HLA and HIBAG were relatively common methods for HLA imputations from SNP chip data.  However, is there another method available where I can test generating HLA imputations for my sample and see if they are more consistent with the sequencing results (for the  "" class II"" HLA genes)? If I understand correctly, the GitHub page for this publication describes using SNP2HLA (which I don't think gave reliable imputations for HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 with my SNP chip data, either for 23andMe or Genes for Good).  However, even if that is true, I don't know if the precise settings can have a noticeable effect on the HLA imputation results? Thank you very much!

A next challenge is to use these approaches to predict alternate conformations and the effects of sequence variants on structure. Considering the ubiquity of functionally significant fold-switching and order-disorder transitions, developing the ability to predict these alternate conformations has the potential to inform the discovery of new drug targets. Similarly, the conformational equilibrium of drug receptors relates to their affinities for drugs, highlighting the importance of predicting the relative population of different conformations. Previous research has found that subsampling the input multiple sequence alignments in AF2 and increasing the number of predictions was able to sample alternative structures of the same target protein, even capturing different fold-switching states of known metamorphic proteins. Prior work has also generated conformational ensembles through reducing the max_seq:extra_seq parameter values and used these ensembles as starting points for molecular dynamics simulations to sample more conformations of interest such as cryptic ligand binding pockets. Here, the authors use a similar approach of MSA subsampling to discover alternate conformations and their relative populations of certain proteins purely using the AF2 pipeline without the need for extensive MD simulations. They demonstrate how subsampling MSA by modulating the max_seq:extra_seq parameters can generate ensembles of protein conformations whose relative populations correlate with experimental knowledge. They test AF2’s capacity to predict differences in conformer populations with two example proteins–Abl1 tyrosine kinase core and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF). With Abl1, they found that AF2 can qualitatively predict the effects of mutations on active state populations of kinase cores with up to eighty percent accuracy. They also found that their method predicted most of the activation loop intermediate states in the active-to-inactive transition of the kinase core, performing comparably to predictions obtained from multi-microsecond MD simulations. Despite the paucity of sequence data for GMCSF compared with Abl1, they were able to predict the extent of variation in backbone dynamics among GMCSF variants, which allowed them to conclude that AF’s prediction engine could decode population signals from relatively scarce data. Overall, the results are very interesting and encouraging and the manuscript is well written. We have the following points which we feel, if addressed, could make this manuscript stronger. Major points: 1. The MSA subsampling approach that the authors have adapted in this work has been used by others previously (as cited by the authors themselves), albeit with some modifications. So it is important to see if the existing methodologies, for instance the DBSCAN based clustering and MSA subsampling by Wayment-Steele et al., are able to predict these relative state populations of variants. Also, the optimization of max_seq:extra_seq requires quite a bit of pre-existing experimental information. How is this method to be applied for a relatively new system? The authors could also provide some guidelines on how the max_seq:extra_seq numbers to be sampled are chosen and in general comment about the hyper-parameter space in their approach and how it compares to other schemes/approaches. 2. Apart from the large change in A-loop from active to inactive state in Abl kinase, the other important structure change involves the 𝛼C helix moving out (as shown in Reference 22 cited in the preprint). The authors have not discussed this aspect. The snapshots shown from enhanced MD does not seem to show this change either (upon visual examination of the snapshots shown in the figures). Hence, the biological relevance of the MD simulation becomes questionable. Does the AF2 subsampled ensemble reflect the change in the helix position? 3. The authors haven’t performed statistical analyses on the RMSD comparisons or the CSP comparisons of GMCSF to claim the differences to be significant or not. For example, the authors say their approach has worked “as the range of the distribution of RMSDs of residues 80-90 and 110-125 is significantly larger for most of the mutations tested at both of these sites”. What is this distribution of RMSD compared against? Are these differences statistically significant? 4. Given that GMCSF has very limited sequence data in MSA to start with, does MSA subsampling actually help? The authors could try doing predictions using the traditional AF2 pipeline and compare those distributions against their approach. Minor points: 1. Although the authors are right in looking for only the ground and I2 states in Abl kinase predictions, it will be interesting to explore if there were any predictions that matched the I1 state and if not, to speculate why more extensively 2. The data on some of the max_seq:extra_seq optimizations discussed for Abl kinase is missing. For example, 512:8 or 8:1024 3. There is no citation provided for the single and double mutants whose relative ground state populations were tested for Abl Kinase. 4. The nature of these mutations on Abl Kinase is not discussed. Are some of these mutations pathogenic or drug-resistant? It will be interesting to correlate the nature of mutation with its structural effects.The authors could provide more introduction of how these mutations were identified and add more discussion on trends. 5. What is the rationale behind choosing the PCs mentioned by the authors for Abl kinase enhanced sampling? 6. Why have the authors not shown the RMSD distribution of Distance 2 in Figure 4C? 7. How were the mutations on the histidine triad of GMCSF chosen? Sebollela et al. 2005 ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih..., which is not cited in this paper specifically but cited in one of the papers (Cui et al. 2020 - https://doi.org/10.1021/acs... that this paper cites, substitutes H15 with alanine to demonstrate a decrease in heparin affinity 8. For the GMCSF system, do the authors see a relationship between the plDDT scores and the extent of RMSD? 9. Prior work that uses AF2 to sample conformational ensembles has seen that AF2 is able to predict more diverse conformations when the protein is not part of AF2’s training dataset. Was GMSCF part of the training dataset? If yes, how would the author’s approach vary for a protein that is not part of the training dataset? 10. Some of the figures are not informative/important enough to be main figures. For example, Figure 2 is mainly the AF2 pipeline, Figure 5 is just a pictorial representation of Supplementary Table S1. Also, Figures 6 and 7 could be combined into a single figure. 11. The CSP data for H15N is not shown in Figure 9B whereas its RMSD is shown in Figure 9C 12. The cut-off values used for jackhmmer not mentioned. 13. Residues are being addressed as codons in some places in the text 14.
