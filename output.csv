What licence is the model available under and where can I obtain it from?

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.21.671454v1#comment-6766162269,biorxivstage,1,"Congratulations on your very interesting study! It represents a valuable contribution to the field of therapeutic splicing correction. We would, however, like to kindly suggest that the manuscript could benefit from the inclusion of additional references to previous work in the field. Specifically, in vivo studies involving intravitreal injection of AAVs to deliver U1 snRNA to the mouse retina have already been conducted and evaluated for efficacy, safety, and potential off-target effects. We believe it would strengthen your manuscript to reference and discuss this study alongside citations of your own previous work (e.g., Balestra et al): •	Swirski S, May O, Ahlers M, Wissinger B, Greschner M, Jüschke C, Neidhardt J. In Vivo Efficacy and Safety Evaluations of Therapeutic Splicing Correction Using U1 snRNA in the Mouse Retina. Cells. 2023 Mar 21;12(6):955. In addition, the following statements from your manuscript: “By targeting the 5′ splice site downstream of specific exons, ExSpeU1s can correct aberrant splicing in various cellular and mouse models” and “To restore defective splicing, ExSpeU1s have been created with sequence changes that permit targeted binding to intronic sequences downstream of the mutant 5’ ss” could benefit from referencing a related U1 snRNA splice-correction study in optic atrophy—a condition that, like familial dysautonomia, is characterized by retinal ganglion cell degeneration: •	Jüschke C, Klopstock T, Catarino CB, Owczarek-Lipska M, Wissinger B, Neidhardt J. Autosomal dominant optic atrophy: A novel treatment for OPA1 splice defects using U1 snRNA adaption. Mol Ther Nucleic Acids. 2021 Oct 21;26:1186-1197. Furthermore, to provide a more comprehensive overview of foundational work in the field, including patient-derived cell lines, and acknowledge earlier contributions toward the development of in vivo U1 snRNA-based therapies, the following publications may also be relevant: •	Tanner G, Glaus E, Barthelmes D, Ader M, Fleischhauer J, Pagani F, Berger W, Neidhardt J. Therapeutic strategy to rescue mutation-induced exon skipping in rhodopsin by adaptation of U1 snRNA. Hum Mutat. 2009;30:255–263. •	Glaus E, Schmid F, Da Costa R, Berger W, Neidhardt J.

U1 snRNA-mediated gene therapeutic correction of splice defects caused by an exceptionally mild BBS mutation. Hum Mutat. 2011;32:815–824. Finally, we would like to highlight two recent publications that might have implications toward potential risks of U1 therapy. Kim et al. showed that U1 snRNP may affect promoter activity by inhibiting premature polyadenylation, and Nadeu et al. identified recurrent tumour-specific U1 snRNA mutations in mature B-cell neoplasms: •	Kim G, Carroll CL, Wakefield ZP, Tuncay M, Fiszbein A.

In CM, brain endothelial cells take up parasite Ags from their luminal side to subsequently cross-present these Ags again on their luminal surface to circulating CD8+ T cells. Our present study shows, however, that inflamed brain microvascular endothelial cells can also process exogenous protein Ags provided from their abluminal side and present it on MHC class I molecules to naïve CD8+ T cells on their luminal side leading to their activation and proliferation and differentiation to effector CD8+ T cells inducing brain endothelial apoptosis."" I just wanted to point out that you state your study shows abluminal presentation and the other study doesn't and then you cite the study (37), however the study you cited does in fact shows microvascular endothelial cells can process Ags from abluminal side and present it in a supplementary figure. They had also presented that data in abstracts since 2018. I just thought it was important to mention they were inaccurately cited and did show this first in their paper.",2025-09-10T17:53:41,,J.

I would rather argue that a) the points you raised, regarding limitations of replicability in Brazilian biomedical science, are worldwide. Errington et al. 2021 faced the same challenges in trying to replicate experiments, with experiments that could not be replicated despite all efforts, and modifications of the protocol in most of them.  Other replication initiatives also reported the same difficulties. No experimental protocol in biomedicine is able to fulfill 100% of the gaps that appear in the laboratory bench practice: there will always be room for individual decisions or unavoidable local differences. Point b) is that the argument of unavoidable protocol adaptations that explains the higher than expected heterogeneity among replicating labs also holds true between original and replicating labs, limiting any attempt (as well as interpretation) of rigorous replication. Moreover, the definition of what is and what is not replication is also an unsettled issue (eg., why 95% CI and not 90% CI since most protocols have breaks?). Replications occur involuntary in the everyday practice of lab, as yet discussed by several authors (e.g., Guttinger S, Leonelli S, Shiffrin, Börner & Stigler), since scientists always start their own research from some previous point in the literature. If this previous starting point doesn’t work, scientists move on to another experimental design, another starting point also taken from the literature. If this failure is also encountered by other labs, this flawed starting point is “naturally” left behind without being ever formally replicated.",2025-09-08T19:40:17,gilbenard,Gil Benard,,,,

Here the elimination of FKBP2, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone with a (putative) role in proinsulin folding, over time nudges the population of cells from what would otherwise be an efficient insulin secreting state (associated with metabolic health) to a state that disfavours proinsulin production and instead favours glucagon secretion and impaired glycemic control at the organismal level.

Best, Marouen Ben Guebila This preprint by Liu et al. provides a timely and needed analysis of the effects of transcription factor (TF) dose response on chromatin accessibility and gene expression using a novel automated ATAC-seq platform. Methods for estimating TF dosage effects are limited and RoboATAC, in combination with ChromBPNet can be a powerful combination to do large-scale experiments and applications in various disease conditions. I have reviewed the main text and figures but not the supplementary material Main comments: The use of HEK293T as a cell model seems adequate to calibrate the method and derive cell-specific regulatory programs and their relation to TF dosage. Shortcomings related to lack of Histone-Chip data and the lack of expression of certain co-activators were adequately addressed by authors. L162: “Given that the majority of the selected TFs primarily function as transcriptional activators,” → This analysis would benefit from a discussion on why most TFs have activator/repressor activity for each gene (Figure 1H). “To investigate the predictive power of DNA sequence alone, we trained ChromBPNet models for each condition after merging replicates.” → How were replicates merged (intersection, union, average)? In Figure 2e - Multinomial regression . Why did this analysis exclude the 4th group of regions “sensitive non-saturating” ? “The inclusion of chromatin state features did not enhance performance for saturating sensitive peaks and closed nonsensitive peaks, and only marginally improved performance for open nonsensitive peaks. This slight enhancement of predictive power may suggest more complex regulatory mechanisms are at play in open nonsensitive peaks” → In this logistic regression analysis, features were considered independently. However, it might be beneficial to model interactions between sequence and chromatin states, to improve prediction and also have more accurate estimates of feature importance. This can be done manually because the number of interactions is small, or automatically by using Random Forests, which model interactions efficiently. With regards to the multinomial regression analysis, it is not clear whether each class was modeled independently or whether multivariate regression was conducted. In the latter case, it might be worth modeling the covariance in the error term to improve prediction. Minor comments: L268 specific ChromBPNet model. (Fig. 3G). → Typo: There is an extra period after “model”. “Our data suggests that the conditions necessary for cooperative IRF4 binding to 3 bp-spaced ISRE” → This statement is not clear from figure 4-E, 2 bp and 3 bp spacing seem similar at high dose ranges for IRF4 head to tail configuration. “As previously shown (Fig. 3), SOX2 begins interacting” –> This result is shown in Figure-3D and E.

Neither do we explicitly claim that these mutations are driven by APOBEC, and we agree that experimental evidence is necessary. We only state that ‘X’ number of SNPs fall within or near sequences with the potential to form IRs in the 2018 isolate. The main point of interest and where the mutation hypothesis arose was when this earlier strain (2018) was compared to newer strains. Here we found that the newer strains shared far fewer of the SNP-associated IR sequences identified in the 2018 strain. Most of the IRs that were ‘lost’ more frequently were those that the SNPs fell within, and not the ones where SNPs were ‘near’ to. Which suggested to us that mutations were arising in these regions more frequently. This also made sense based on observations in other organisms. Moreover, the previous bias of including those near to would not have skewed the overall observations as most of these IRs were retained in the new strains. The APOBEC hypothesis itself was based on previous observations by Isidro et al which formed the rationale for this study. They propose that the SNPs might be due to APOBEC mutations, and we were only trying to provide an observation that might support their hypothesis. Our mentioning of APOBEC was only to give our study some logical context. We agree that experimental evidence is absolutely critical to confirm these observations and apologise if we have misinterpreted the biological outcomes. Hopefully this has provided some clarification for our study. Best, The Authors",2025-09-01T08:12:19,,Stefan,,,,

This described H.J. Muller’s attempt to explain why ( not how) X chromosome dosage compensation had evolved, in spite of there being only ""exceedingly minute differences"" between compensated and uncompensated phenotypes (2). It was shown that the paradox could be resolved by considering, not the specific functions of individual proteins, but the collective functions of proteins per se. One such function would be the collective pressure exerted by proteins in the crowded cytosol to drive individual protein species from simple solution (aggregation) when their concentrations exceed specific thresholds. It was proposed that over evolutionary time, individual genes, both on X-chromosomes and autosomes, would have fine-tuned factors such as transcription rates and protein stabilities to this collective pressure. However, without X-chromosome dosage compensation the total concentration of cytosolic proteins, and hence the collective pressure, would have fluctuated between male and female generations. Fine-tuning, a process of vital importance for intracellular self/not-self discrimination, would have been severely compromised. By that time (1994), with no clear justification, the assumption had grown that the degeneration of the Y-chromosome was alone sufficient to drive the evolution of dosage compensation. Thus in 1933 Haldane wrote (3): ""The tendency to balance may be regarded as a secondary effect of the accumulation of recessive lethals on the Y-chromosome. Indeed, this accumulation can only proceed as the X develops internal balance."" This coupling of Y degeneration and dosage compensation was implied by others. Charlesworth (1978) wrote (4) that the gradual degeneration of the Drosophila Y-chromosome itself: ""Creates a selection pressure for differentially increasing the activity of the X-chromosome in heterogametic individuals."" Of the mammalian type of dosage compensation, in 1991 Charlesworth wrote (5) that this: ""Creates a selective advantage to reducing X activity in the homogametic sex"" and added that degeneration of the Y-chromosome and dosage compensation are ""processes which must almost inevitably occur."" Much of the subsequent literature addressed the fascinating question of how dosage compensation could have evolved mechanistically in different species. Despite its promise in settling fundamental problems in immunology, the why problem received little attention.

To support reproducibility and general 3D microscopy benchmarking (not tied to a specific project), may I request a small, de-identified sample of raw light-sheet volumes (primarily structural/reference channels; cropped/downsampled is fine)? This is for academic use only with no redistribution; I’m happy to sign a DUA and delete the data upon request or project completion. If feasible, please share a contact email or your preferred sharing method (Globus/S3/institutional storage). Minimal metadata like voxel size and channel order would be very helpful.

Using the EVmutation human protein dataset (Pfam ID available at https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/evmutation/human_proteins.html ), the homolog counts do not match the values presented in the manuscript. Please clarify how homologs were identified and filtered. Comment 2 – Mutational Landscape: Although the EVcouplings python package allows generating a full mutational landscape, the manuscript seems to have excluded some residues selectively. This raises concerns that the mutational coverage may be biased and could affect downstream predictions. Comment 3 – Single vs Double Mutations: While the study claims to evaluate only single-point mutations, two reported cases (D87A and D88A) are actually double mutations. This discrepancy should be addressed to ensure correct interpretation of the results. Comment 4 – Reproducibility of Methods Sequence alignments and MM-PBSA free energy results are not reproducible with the details provided. Key parameters, input data, or scripts may be missing, making independent verification difficult. Providing full code, input files, and detailed protocols would improve reproducibility.",2025-08-25T04:43:46,disqus_VpXcVGGV0c,Abdul Basit,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.19.604377v1#comment-6754737944,biorxivstage,0,"The authors present interesting information showing that a KD could enhance glutamine uptake when glucose is reduced through KD thus suggesting that glutamine targeting would be effective for managing pancreatic cancer when employed together with KD therapy. Mukherjee et al. presented a similar therapeutic strategy but with an explanation for the therapeutic effect different from that of the author’s ( https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-019-0455-x).  It is important for the authors to address the different explanations for the similar findings in their discussion. Besides an anapleurotic explanation for the role of glutamine in driving tumor growth, the authors should also address a role for mitochondrial substrate level phosphorylation in the glutaminolysis pathway as an additional explanation for the effect ( https://doi.org/10.1080/17590914.2024.2422268). The authors assume that ketone bodies and fatty acids are critical fuel sources for pancreatic tumor cells based on their finding of labeled TCA metabolites derived from beta-hydroxybutyrate and caprylic acid. No evidence is presented showing that the pancreatic tumor cells can survive on these fuels in the absence of glucose and glutamine.  Caution is needed in considering labeled TCA metabolites as evidence for fuel utilization in the absence of viability studies. Abnormalities in mitochondria structure and function are found in pancreatic cancer (https://doi. org/ 10. 3109/ 01913 123. 2013. 788306; https:// www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ pubmed/ 6185201; https:// www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ pubmed/ 968802). Such abnormalities would obstruct efficient utilization of fatty acids and ketone bodies for ATP synthesis.  The authors must address the question of how ketone bodies and fatty acids can be critical fuel sources in pancreatic cancer showing abnormalities in mitochondria structure and function. Support for the author’s assumption would come from bioenergetic evidence showing that the MIA-PaCa2 cells die in hypoxia and cyanide, which would be expected for cells dependent on fatty acids & ketone bodies for fuel. No credible evidence is presented showing that the MIA-PaCa2 have normal mitochondrial function. The authors mention (reference 22) as an example of a ""push-pulse"" strategy, where a ketogenic diet nudges a system towards greater dependency on a specific metabolic program, which in turn exposes new dependencies. This paper is incorrectly cited as there is no mention of a ""push-pulse"" strategy in the paper. The correct terminology is “Press-Pulse and was first presented in the following paper, which is the correct citation (DOI 10.1186/s12986-017-0178-2).",2025-08-19T19:07:24,disqus_Pwi06huCe1,Eric Miller,,,,

A few suggestions for improvements to the optical explanations: - You suggest that the improvement in imaging depth achieved in THG in your experiments is mainly related to the wavelength used. But 1320 nm probably does not make a significant difference compared to 1150 nm. In fact, your gain compared to the other work you cite is mainly due to the use of 1 MHz OPA excitation. - You write “In previous work, we showed that the intensity of the THG signal from a slab of lipid surrounded by water increases exponentially with slab thickness” -> it is actually quadratically",2025-08-19T12:25:54,emmanuel_beaurepaire,Emmanuel Beaurepaire,,,,
