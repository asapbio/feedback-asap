I have a specific concern regarding figure 6. If I understand correctly, you make the assumption that the frequency of Ki67 positive cells directly correlates with proliferation speed. I find this assumption problematic, Ki67 protein accumulates in S-G2M and is degraded in G0/G1 (see for instance PMID: 30067968).  One can find that, at steady growth, a shortening of SG2M will actually reduce the proportion of Ki67+ cells, (a shortening of G1 will however increase it), depending on these parameters, the growth rate of the population could be significantly larger for big clones with no change to the proportion of Ki67+ cells. With the Fucci markers combined with ki67 you might be able to resolve this question, but I can imagine it would be very difficult to also identify different clones in this case.

I do hope that a substantially revised version of this paper would eventually be published—in an internationally renowned journal. The authors have done a great job and deserve such a form of recognition. Still, the paper also suffers from several shortcomings that have less to do with its 'pre-print' status than with its theoretical and methodological foundations. The following is a brief exposition of its weaknesses, as I see them. The paper is beset with inconsistencies. To begin with, the contrast between 'ERC science' and 'Consortia science' is a non-starter. Not only do some ERC grants require grantees to set up international consortia (i.e., Synergy Grants), but, also, 'Consortia science' in this context aims to group together types of EU-awarded grants that are internally diverse, including Research and Innovation Actions (that make provision for fundamental research) and Innovation Actions (that do not). 'Consortia science', put it simply, do not exist—not even as an analytical category. Along these lines, at some point in the 'Introduction' section, the paper hints at an important aspect of grant funding: the constant need to look for new funding, or 'strategic anticipation'. This has to do neither with 'consortia science' nor with 'ERC science', because, in both cases, recipients are expected and must search for funding once the project is finished. Unfortunately, this rather important aspect of grant funding (or project-based funding) is nowhere considered in the presentation and discussion of results. Pursuing this line of research further would be rather illuminating and would help us disclose the real problems connected to grant funding (a topic that Merimans is concerned with in another paper, already published). Also critical, by this commentator's point of view, is the assimilation of 'international collaboration' to 'knowledge co-creation' and 'knowledge co-production'. This usage is clearly confusing and misguiding. 'Co-production' has a very specific meaning in Science and Technology Studies, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with getting industry involved in the project. Furthermore, the reality of RIAs and IAs do not stand to the implied meaning of such moniker. Most of the time, such involvement truly amounts to a division of labour, according to which the companies in question act as 'demonstration cases' that implement and test (or demonstrate) the technology being proposed. Nowhere can one find an instance of 'co-production'. I am pretty sure that the authors know a great deal about grant funding, and about EC's Framework Programmes in particular. Yet, the previous critical remarks are a glaring illustration that additional research is needed to get fully acquainted with the subtleties of such funding scheme—knowledge necessary to fully understand what is at stake in the interviews. To conclude with this informal review, two methodological remarks: 1) it is by no means clear which the selection of participants have been. I believe that only a minority of them have experience in ERC grants (either applying for them or, crucially, gaining them), so that framing the whole paper in terms of 'how well ERC grants are' might be, once again, distorting and misleading; 2) nowhere are details about the coding process being offered. As the research work, despite the pre-print format of the paper, seems to have concluded, this is not an absence that can be attributed to the preliminary stage at which the results have been published. Hoping that these indications help the authors improve the manuscript.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.01.530637v1#comment-6609961176,biorxivstage,0,"I would like to suggest a few experiments / changes in information that will increase the value of the manuscript: - Hemoglobin content in the Hb-NPs. In the field of blood substitutes, the Hb content is an important factor in NP synthesis, since the majority of the particle’s weight should consist of Hb to be able to deliver somewhat sufficient oxygen. (in RBCs, Hb is 96% of its dry weight). Could the authors also calculate and add the Hb content within the NP weight (the weight% Hb)? Going off the information given in Section 4.3: ‘Hemoglobin is passively encapsulated by combining the desired concentration of hemoglobin with silk solution prior to combining with PVA.’ Does that mean 250 µg/mL Hb was added into a 5% w/v silk solution (0.25 mg/mL / 50 mg/mL = 0.005 = 0.5 %). With Silk:PVA = 1:4, thus a 4x dilution (=1.25%).  Thus, the Hb content is either 1.25% (for 250 Hb formulations) or 0.625% (for 125 Hb formulations)? Whatever the Hb content is, it will give valuable information in their potential, and worth reporting in the manuscript. - UV-Vis Spectroscopy. The authors determine the mHb% using the cyanmethemoglobin method, which is based on the UV-Vis spectra of Hb. Would it be possible to add the full UV-Vis spectra of the tested formulation in the SI? Often, NPs create an absorbance signal itself, so it would be nice to see how this affects the measurements, if at all. - In vitro studies. Section 4.10: ‘The wells stimulated with silk nanoparticles received 250 μl of M0 media supplemented with 50 μg of silk particles.’ How did this concentration come about? Would it be possible to add a prior cell viability assay that determined the optimal particle concentration to use, or even show a IC50?",2024-12-12T11:32:12,,eggersii,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.25.620249v1#comment-6607526920,biorxivstage,2,"Science Discussion The multiple modern, peer reviewed papers on the field status of Ivory-billed Woodpecker (IBWO) are dominated by visual media depicting putative or actual  Ivory-billed Woodpeckers. The most important and impactful data sets determining that the species is extant is the collection of thousands of video and picture frames taken by discreet researchers with various cameras. Since there is only one other large woodpecker in the USA, which is not a congeneric, using visual evidence is effective as the two species are quite different in plumage, movements, and behavior. Visual evidence of putative or actual IBWOs shows that the subjects are clearly not Pileateds when plumage, movements and behavior are examined. Elevating the veracity of acoustical evidence firmly indicating IBWO presence, as this paper concludes, is problematic since there are several known and hypothetical avian and other vertebrate sources of kent calls. A major, glaring omission is that the putative IBWO kent data set is only compared to one Blue Jay kent when it is well known that several species of vertebrates, including birds, amphibians and mammals, are accepted as producing Ivory-billed-like kent sounds.  Even if the author establishes or approaches establishing that the putative IBWO kents are not blue jays, which is not accomplished, he has not addressed any other competing species. Note that the 2024 peer reviewed paper ""Echo of extinction: The Ivory-billed Woodpecker's tragic legacy and its impact on scientific integrity"", P. Michalak employs a much more sophisticated spectrogram analysis than the prepaper and found the putative IBWO kents from LA  did not match with known IBWO kents. (Bio Science, Volume 74, Issue 11, November 2024, Pages 740–746, https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biae072 Compounding the impediments to a firm acoustical ID, the only widely accepted kents of IBWOs recorded were of agitated birds (n =2), 90  years ago from the Singer Tract, LA.  Alerted or stressed individual birds can have frequencies different than nominal productions of the same song or call type. This prepaper fails to even acknowledge these major and other issues yet somehow has very strong  conclusions that are therefore unsupported, metaphysical and proselytizing in nature rather than scientifically anchored. One well known competing source of IBWO-like kents is the Blue Jay (BLJA). For decades it has been understood that some spectrograms of Blue Jay kents have shown differences with Singer Tract, LA, Ivory-billed kents. At a minimum any research paper that attempts to address and dispositively conclude this issue will need careful spectrogram analysis of many examples of these Blue Jay  kents and then compare them to IBWO kents or putative IBWO kents. The biological context of the putative jay kents must be detailed; not ignored. Many would concur with the prepaper author including Choctawhatchee River, FL kents in the set of putative Ivory-billed kents since these were spatiotemporal to hundreds of other IBWO supporting data points in key data sets such as---suggestive videos, IB sightings some by 2 observers, recorded and heard Campephilus-like double knocks near the kents, IB-like roosts holes. etc. I have line surveyed the Choctawhatchee River over 120 hours and found Blue Jays to be non-existent to rare since this river bottom corridor has few oaks. Unfortunately the author's standards for most of the non-Choctawhatchee, FL, alleged IBWO kents in his set is minimal and nebulous. The prepaper has so many biases, omissions, and basic scientific flaws that a rewrite is needed.  A terse comment here however  would not help the conservation of the few Ivory-bills likely left. The following observations and recommendations are offered. The data in this prepaper includes only one Blue Jay kent call spectrogram which was recorded and commented on by many over the decades. The author then inserts an unprecedented, unfounded and unsound comparative method, not found in the ornithological literature. The data includes ~ 136 Blue Jay calls, of which none are kent calls, to claim the establishment of an unabridged frequency capability for all types of Blue Jay calls. The author erroneously takes his incomplete set, in regards to the species extensive repertoire of Blue Jay and any hypothetical spectrograms and concludes that this eliminates all possible frequencies, tonality or partials/harmonics that may be produced when a Blue Jay kents. The author takes the actually abridged set of Hz and illogically and awkwardly states in the Abstract ""Differences are seen such that these two species cannot be mistaken for each other"". In the Conclusion sections he  supports the hyperbole by stating that interspecific physiological differences make it impossible for a BLJA to produce the Hzs he found in the putative IBWO set of kents he examined. ""Because of different morphology and functional anatomy, Blue Jays and Ivory-billed Woodpeckers are going to make different quality sounds."" He continues that all Blue Jay kents cannot be IBWO kents and the reverse but the scientific premise he employs is  unprecedented in ornithological research. The text or bibliography does not include one reference that uses body length as a driver or predictor of avian Hz range capabilities. During an on-line comment exchange with the author pivotal parts of his concept are formed by the idea that a larger bird cannot possibly be matched by smaller birds as far as Hz convergence. In this case the birds are of relatively similar size of 20 inches and 12 inches. There is no Ostrich to Hummingbird length disparity involved here. The author may have no field experience with any members of the genus genus Procnias (bellbirds) with a 125 decibel level with a body length of 11 inches.  Volume or Hz range may have little to no correlation with body size. I have searched the literature unsuccessful to discover what the author is possibly using as a prerequisite to his sweeping Bergmann's rule-like conclusions that correlate acoustical Hz and moderate changes in avian body size. This is an example of common sense bias that a 20 inch bird cannot produce at least some of the same Hz as a 12 inch bird. These biases and assertions seem unsupported and unlikely hypotheses let alone conclusions by the author. The author is responsible for doing a literature search, not readers, before prepapers are posted; the text and bibliography portray minimal research was done to support the presented hyperbolic declarations. Most publication submittals are rejected because the literature search was poor. This prepaper's bibliography verifies that not even one adequate reference let alone comprehensive work on Blue jay ecology, mimicry, relative high intelligence, syrinx, physiology, vocalizations, point surveys for Blue Jays in the alleged IBWO kent areas, etc. was read or done . Blue Jay' hypothetical acoustical capabilities have as a pretext a species possessing a syrinx with broad capabilities, high avian intelligence, wide repertoire, strong memory and substantial mimicry ability.  Years ago I checked the literature on the subject species and at these rather mid value frequencies and harmonics there is no physiologically based reason that IBWO kents and Blue Jay kents must always be at different Hzs. In addition  the literature does generalize that there is often sexual intraspecific differences in a species Hz for the same general call, such as a kent.  Extrapolating from known ornithological literature, no one knows how a male blue jay would mimic a modern female IBWO it ambiently heard kenting; how a female blue jay would imitate a male IBWO, etc.  It is not known how a blue jay would mimic a nuthatches kent vs an IBWO it heard kenting. A major, glaring omission is that the putative IBWO kent data set is only compared to one Blue Jay kent when it is well known that several species of vertebrates, including birds, amphibians and mammals, are known to produce IBWO-like kent sounds. Brief info on Hz Within a single bird species, different calls can have varying frequencies. This variation can depend on several factors: 1.            Type of Call: Different calls serve different purposes (e.g., alarm calls, mating calls, contact calls) and can have distinct frequency ranges. 2.            Individual Variation: Just like humans have unique voices, individual birds may produce calls with slightly different frequencies due to physiological differences. 3.            Context and Situation: The context in which a call is made can influence its frequency. For example, a bird may alter its call if it's trying to signal alarm in a crowded area versus calling to a mate. 4.            Environmental Factors: The surrounding environment can affect how calls are produced and perceived. For instance, birds may adjust their calls in dense forests versus open areas. The Abstract is ambiguous and misleading; also inconsistent with the rest of the paper. The Abstract does not mention many of the strong conclusions and constructs that accumulate as the paper proceeds. The constructs and conclusions, if true, would be quite compelling,  with scientific value; the issue of distinguishing recorded Ivory-billed Woodpecker kent calls from other species kent calls is a complex issue. Unfortunately this paper ineffectively addresses the issue with a short,  terse incomplete Abstract that is subsequently followed by unsubstantiated and unsupported conclusions and erroneous, sweeping ornithological assertions. Ambiguity---the paper’s central theme is initially thought to be that IBWO kents can be distinguished from Blue Jay kents. The short Abstract mentions ~ 136 Blue Jay calls have been examined; after quite a bit of reading one finds out that only one of the ~136 Blue Jays calls examined is a jay kent call ( Blue jay calls, n = 137, Blue jay kent call n = 1).  At this point some readers will realize the omission in the Abstract is an intended pathway to one of the papers eventual conclusions that Blue Jays are physiologically incapable of producing the Hz found in the putative IBWO putative kent call spectrograms. Misleading---the Title and Abstract concentrate on Blue Jay kents; the latter highlighting  n’s of 136 and n = 200, but these numbers are for data sets that do not include any Blue Jay kents. Actual Blue Jay kents spectrograms examined closely by this paper is  n = 1. Inconsistent --- The Abstract is overstated yet some of the subsequent constructs and conclusions are bold and somewhat hyperbolic. Conclusions presented are unsupported and are more correctly described as hypothesizes or unsupported hypothesizes. The paper has n = > 200 for putative IBWO kent calls but fails to call them putative. This omission leads to concerns of circular logic. The paper  provides no supporting evidence that some of these putative IBWO  kent calls were derived from birds that were field IDed as IBWOs or for some reason likely IBWOs. Acceptable reasons could be that the subject kent call were associated with a tempospatially IBWO sighting or double knocks. Field details are needed for all  kents that were not from Choctawhatchee River, FL. Kents in that study were spatiotemporal to hundreds of others IBWO supporting data points in data sets. It is possible that a hypothesis that all IBWO and BLJA kents can be differentiated by spectrograms is correct. I propose it as a hypothesis. However jumping to premature conclusions with so much missing is not the way to proceed. We have delayed the erroneous extinction proposal with solid field techniques that had little if anything to do with Blue Jays and exaggerations but did truthfully present the videos, game cams, sighting notes, etc. IBWO conservation will not be prodded by examining characteristics such as acoustical Hz with flawed methods. Some will rightfully suspect that these odd assertions are designed to proselytize rather than establish the truth.",2024-12-09T01:41:58,avtrader,avtrader,10.1101/2024.10.25.620249,Ivory-billed Woodpecker and Blue Jay kent comparisons at spectrogram level reveal differences,John D Williams,2024-10-25

They do not reflect the opinions of each individual journal club participant. Any responses to these points should be addressed to Malte Elson. In their preprint, Spiess et al. (2024) illustrate the impact of influential data points on statistical significance in linear regression analyses. The authors reanalyzed data from three high-impact journals by searching for the term ""linear regression” and digitizing graphs of the included papers (due to the absence of raw data). Their findings revealed that excluding influential data points often rendered previously significant results non-significant. The simulations included in the study largely confirmed expected outcomes, supporting the overall argument for incorporating leave-one-out analyses in data analyses practices. The authors ultimately advocate for broader adoption of such methods to enhance the robustness of statistical conclusions. We found the paper to be interesting and an illustrative contribution to statistical education, both in terms of the potential fragility of published claims and as an illustration of an intuitive but underused outlier detection method. We identified points that might allow the authors to strengthen future versions of the manuscript, including some critical points about potential weaknesses or absences in the current version of the manuscript. 1) TERMINOLOGY CONFUSION AND REPORTING ISSUES * Graphs vs. Papers: There is some confusion regarding the unit of analyses, and probably some reporting errors: On p. 4, l. 115, the paper states that the sample was 24 + 30 + 46 = 100 graphs, whereas on p. 6, l. 170 the authors state they examined 100 publications (going by Table 1, this is a simple clerical error, and should say graphs). * Similarly, the description of the columns in Table 1 (p. 11) is confusing, and we think has at least one reporting error: * It is unclear what “Hits” represent: Are these unique papers, or do the search engines of Science/Nature/PNAS return the same paper multiple times for each  instance of the search term (“linear regression”)? * What does ""number of graphs that were not shown"" mean? We think these are instances of linear regressions that simply were not reported with a corresponding graph in the original publication, but they could also be graphs missing, inaccessible, or excluded * The “Articles” column is described as “number of Articles in which the analyzable graphs were found” (p. 11, l. 314), but we think these are the 21 articles in which the 29 “influential variables” were found. The number of articles with analyzable graphs is not reported. It thus remains unclear how many papers were included, and how many graphs were analyzed from each paper. * On p. 6, the authors report having identified 29 graphs in 21 papers in which the removal of one datapoint changes the result of a linear regression (see also Figure 1). On p. 6, l. 179 the “incidence” (should be prevalence instead) of changes in papers is reported as ~20%. However, this puts papers (21) in the numerator and graphs in the denominator (100), which underestimates the prevalence. On the graph-level, it should be 29/100 = 29%. The paper-level prevalence cannot be calculated because the authors do not report the number of papers with analyzable graphs (see above). * We strongly recommend reporting a Prisma flowchart to clarify the inclusion/exclusion of graphs and papers. In the same vein, the paper lacks basic information about the included studies, such as sample sizes or the distribution of p-values. Other information would also help emphasizing the importance of the present study, e.g. citation metrics. * The authors refer to “Supplementary Data 1” (p. 4, l. 121) but provide no link. 2) SAMPLING STRATEGY * The study focuses on digitizable graphs without overlapping data points, inherently excluding studies with (1) larger samples and (2) homogeneous effects, where overlapping data points should be more frequent. This selection skews the included papers towards studies with smaller samples and p-values near 0.05 (due to lower power and publication bias / p-hacking), which are more susceptible to the illustrated effects. This is not a problem per se, but means the findings (including the prevalence rate) are about a narrower population of studies. Either way, the selection effects should be discussed in the paper. * It is not fully clear how it was decided which graphs are analyzable and which are not. Moreover, on p. 4, l. 127-130 the authors state that the obtained regression parameters match those reported in the paper closely, but they do not further explain what exactly this means, or what happened when they did not match 3) ANALYSES AND CONCLUSIONS * The analysis does not account for dependencies when multiple graphs from the same paper, which will likely be based on the same data (which are then susceptible to the exclusion effects), are included. * In a way, the susceptibility of findings to the removal of a single data point is a restatement of issues related to small samples. Small samples are inherently more fragile, and larger sample sizes are more robust to the influence of removing (or adding) single data points and render p-values (and other estimates) more stable. This is not to say that the findings reported are not interesting; however, we were wondering whether a table of all included studies sorted by observed p-value and sample size would have flagged the same fragile papers. This is also not to say that dfstat is redundant, and we absolutely see the pedagogical value in being able to point at individual data points that “cause” a finding to be significant. Rather, we would be interested to what extent dfstat converges with common heuristics. * Relatedly, the authors decry that influence measures such as dfstat are largely ignored, even by statisticians (p. 4, l. 139). This may well be, but of course, statisticians (and non-statisticians) are obviously aware of issues related to low power and small samples, and one of these issues is the problem of spurious findings (e.g. due to few, extreme data points). * The authors largely blame frequentist statistics, particularly on p. 10, where e.g. they state that “[a]s long as stating significance or not is still based on the ubiquitous α = 0.05 threshold, these statements can be sensitive to the presence of a single data point.” (l. 282-284). However, it is unclear how this follows from their findings. Any inference (not just α = 0.05) could be susceptible to the influence of single data points when the estimate is close to the criterion. Moreover, particularly when the sample size is low, any metric’s value (e.g. point estimates) will vary as a function of the removal of individual data points, regardless of whether the inference is threshold-based or not. This is simply a property of statistical models fit to a limited amount of data. So again, the issue seems to be with small sample sizes. 4) RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Things we would have liked to see: * Additional analyses, such as leave-two-out or leave-k-out methods. The leave-one-out analyses are providing a good intuition of how fragile some small-sample study results are. Additional leave-k-out analyses would provide further information about the fragility of the entire sample. * So far, the authors are concerned with the fragility of results as an outcome of removing data points. An additional study exploring the reverse scenario would be valuable. Specifically, it could investigate how extreme an additional data point would need to be to alter results, and how adding non-extreme data points could mitigate the relative weight of extreme data points. * Discussing dfstat as a robustness metric (“How many individual data points would have to be removed/added to render a significant result nonsignificant or vice versa”) * A discussion of how dfstat could be used for p-hacking by showing researchers which data points they would have to remove to turn a nonsignificant study result into a significant one. * The authors graciously and immediately shared data and code with one of us who requested it, and we thank them for this. We would like to see this data and code provided in a public repository and linked to in a future version of the manuscript. * We note that the authors chose to anonymise their data so that the reader cannot tell which original study’s results are robust or not. Personally, we think that meta-scientific interests are best served by making this information public; that is, we would like this data to not merely be used to illustrate the method but also inform the reader about the fragility or robustness of those publications’ results. Of course, not everyone agrees with this practice - perhaps the authors could comment on their perspective on this issue in a future version of the manuscript.",2024-12-06T17:54:14,,Malte Elson ,10.1101/2024.10.30.621016,Scientific reasoning driven by influential data: resuscitate dfstat!,"Andrej-Nikolai Spiess, Stefan Rödiger, Matthias Schaks, Michał Burdukiewicz, Joel Tellinghuisen",2024-10-30

Their lead compound effectively reduces the putative pathological substance, VLCFAs, in the CNS. There are a few points to address in this paper that could significantly improve an otherwise strong piece of work. In figure 2 Huang et al report C26:0/C22:0 levels. These probably slightly underestimate the potency of their compound, as ELOVL1 inhibition reduces not only C26:0, but also C22:0, the denominator. Through most of the paper, they report absolute concentrations, so this is a minor concern. Huang et al incorrectly report that our studies (Come et al, 2021) ""measured only Lysophosphotidylcholine C26:0 levels"", and were thus less complete. We report reductions in C26:0 LPCs, acyl carnitines and total VLCFAs in the CNS in our paper. Huang et al report that ""treatment with the ELOVL1 inhibitor unexpectedly led to profound transcriptional changes beyond correction of pathways altered by the loss of ABCD1."" Almost all small molecule drugs have off target activities and clinically apparent side effects that are accompanied by transcriptional changes. The most parsimonious explanation for the ""off target"" transcriptional changes is ""off target"" activity of the compound. If they were to test multiple structurally distinct ELOVL1 inhibitors and find a shared pattern across scaffolds, that could support the argument that this is somehow a general property of small molecule ELOVL1 inhibition. The conclusion to their abstract that ""ELOVL1 inhibition may have broader consequences . . . than the correction of lipid homeostasis"" goes beyond the data they have in hand. In the face of a disease that is fatal in one third of boys who carry mutations, such changes in transcriptional profiles, without any associated findings in traditional in vivo toxicology studies, should not be a reason to discontinue development. Indeed, an absence of ""off-target"" or unexpected transcriptional changes is a barrier that even most currently prescribed safe and effective drugs could not meet. This paper presents an impressive chemistry campaign and biological characterization of novel ELOVL1 inhibitors.",2024-12-06T16:11:31,sanjaymagavi,Sanjay Magavi,10.1101/2024.11.11.622837,Elovl1 inhibition reduced very long chain fatty acids in a mouse model of adrenoleukodystrophy,"Jeremy Y.

Here are two examples: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NZ_BMOE01000030.1?report=fasta https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NZ_WWEN01000019.1?report=fasta Both of these are small contigs, and therefore may not actually be part of a contiguous bacteria genome. When we BLAST them with BLASTN, they match very closely known synthetic vectors for working with HIV. Therefore, in these two cases (and all others I've spot checked, although I have not been comprehensive), there is no evidence that these genes are present in the bacterial genome. Rather, these are evidently cases where someone was sequencing an HIV-related sample on the same lane as a bacterial genome, and cross-contamination occurred (either index hopping or well to well). The HIV-vector sequence was then assembled as part of the bacterial genome, and missed in contamination screening (both by the authors and by NCBI!). Thus I was not able to identify any cases of genomic evidence for the claims of the authors, although I did not look at every hit because the pattern above quickly emerged. If the authors of this work want to provide sufficient evidence for the claim that there are close homologs of HIV related proteins in bacterial genomes, I would suggest taking a close manual inspection of all hits in their table. They should be able to show that these hits are integrated into bacterial chromosomes, and not always on separate contigs. They should show the raw reads then support those integrations. If the claim is that ""some bacteria can acquire HIV-1 genetic material"", they should then also do a comparison at the nucleotide level, not at the translated amino acid level. Finally, if that claim was tree, they should construct a phylogenetic tree to identify the nearest HIV relative and estimate time since divergence. However, it is simply dubious that this is biologically true, because it would be an extraordinary claim if true, with no evidence yet emerged. It is essential to always closely inspect genomic results.

This strategy involves overexpressing ribonucleotide reductase in hPSC-CMs, enhancing their dATP production. Key outcomes include increased left ventricular function, greater exercise capacity, improved cardiac metabolism, and reduced symptoms of heart failure in animal models. The approach combines remuscularization with enhanced contractility, offering a novel therapeutic direction for chronic heart failure. Major Revisions 1. Validation of Claims: - Doubts: The study's claims about the efficacy of dATP-producing CMs in treating chronic heart failure need stronger validation in larger and diverse animal models and human studies. - Critique: The majority of the experimental data involve rodent models. Larger animal studies and eventual human trials are crucial for assessing translative potential and variability in responses (e.g., differences in metabolism and immune reactions). - Example: ""Our goal was to improve regenerative strategies by genome-editing hPSC to make dATP-donor cells… Our results indicate that dATP donor CMs can… persistently improve the function of the chronically injured heart"". 2. Mechanisms of dATP Delivery: - Clarification: Detailed mechanisms on how dATP is transported through gap junctions from donor to host cardiomyocytes require further elucidation and quantification. - Critique: While the study mentions gap junction-mediated dATP transfer, the precise dynamic and extent of this transfer across intercellular connections in vivo are not fully described. - Example: ""In vivo, dATP-producing CMs formed new myocardium that transferred dATP to host cardiomyocytes via gap junctions, increasing their dATP levels"". 3. Long-Term Safety and Efficacy: - Skepticism: Long-term safety data and potential adverse effects of continuous dATP elevation, such as risks of arrhythmogenicity, were not adequately addressed. - Critique: Although the study indicates beneficial dATP effects, continuous high levels of dATP need further investigation to rule out chronic side effects including arrhythmias or maladaptive cardiac remodeling. - Example: Concerns: ""Interventions to increase the contractility of the failing heart have been sought for decades…our novel strategy of cell therapy…"". Minor Revisions 1. Typos and Errors: - There are a few minor typographical errors and ambiguities in phrasing that can be corrected for better readability. 2. Figures and Diagrams Consistency: - The figures and diagrams should uniformly represent the data and should be referenced consistently within the text (e.g., Fig 6 referenced properly with aligned legends and labels). 3. Formatting and Style: - Standardize font sizes and alignments, particularly in figures and tables. Ensure that equation formatting, subscripts, and superscripts are consistently applied. Recommendations 1. Include Larger Animal Studies: - Conduct larger and more diverse animal studies to establish translational efficacy and safety across different species. This would bridge the existing gap between rodent models and potential human applications. 2. Detailed Mechanistic Studies: - Expand mechanistic studies on the biophysics of dATP transfer and integration into host cells, detailing the kinetics of dATP movement and concentration gradients across different heart zones. 3. Extended Safety Profiles: - Investigate long-term safety profiles of dATP elevation in vivo, focusing on electrical stability of myocardial tissues and potential non-target effects on other tissues/organs跨链接。 4. Human Trials: - Initiate phase I clinical trials after thorough preclinical validations to evaluate safety, dosage, efficacy, and delivery mechanisms in human heart failure patients. 5. Data Sharing and Reproducibility: - Provide access to raw data and methodological details to enhance reproducibility and allow independent verification of results. In conclusion, the preprint presents a promising approach to treating chronic heart failure using genetically engineered hPSC-CMs. Nonetheless, further work on validation, safety, and translational studies is essential to move toward clinical applications.",2024-12-06T01:19:33,xpeerd,xPeer,,,,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.27.564195v2#comment-6605738895,biorxivstage,1,"There is increasing evidence suggesting an interplay between DNA damage response (DDR) and cellular metabolism pathways, specifically regarding the regulatory role of the DDR kinase Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and the metabolic regulator mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) in p16-low cancer cells. However, the mechanism by which ATR regulates mTORC1 activity remains poorly understood. To address these knowledge gaps, the authors of the Tangudu et al. manuscript investigated the role of ATR  in activating mTORC1 in both unperturbed and p16 knockdown cell models. The findings of this study unveiled several key novelties including the role of ATR in modulating mTORC1 activity via de novo cholesterol synthesis under both low p16 expression and basal conditions. Additionally, lanosterol synthase (LSS), an enzyme that regulates the biosynthesis of cholesterol, is regulated by ATR, and ATR's regulation of mTORC1 is independent of the Checkpoint Kinase 1 (CHK1) and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) pathways. Several innovative experimental techniques were employed within the course of the study, including the simultaneous proteomic and transcriptomic profiling used to identify transcriptional and post-translational changes in ATR signaling and the use of phospho-specific antibodies to monitor the effects of ATR modulation on mTORC1 activation at specific time points. However, we have identified one major concern that we believe should be addressed prior to the publication of the paper. The major concern that was found in the paper was that the mechanism of action for the ATR-mTORC1 pathway was not fully represented in all the broad ranges of cells in the data shown in the figures. The issue is that while in Figure 1 the expression of ATR and mTORC1 was shown through a broad range of cell lines, the latter portion of the paper focused primarily on SKMEL28 cells, a melanoma cell line, which does not fully represent the broad spectrum of the cellular model that the ATR-mTORC1 pathway has a role in general cell metabolism and proliferation. An experiment that could be done to address this major issue of underrepresentation of the ATR-mTORC1 expression in unperturbed cells, as well as diseased cells, is to repeat the experiments done from Figure 2 to Figure 4 in all cells that were used in Figure 1 (HeLa, HEK293, MEFs). There are also some minor concerns we identified with the manuscript. One small issue is the lack of quantification or statistical analysis included in Figure 1. This would allow for a better understanding of the content of the figure. Another minor concern is the coloration of the fluorescence images in Figure 4. The chosen colors make it difficult to make out the overlaps in the merged images, especially in Figure 4B. This could be fixed by changing the colors to ones that are more distinct when merged. The final minor concern identified is the absence of GTPase Rheb in the working model. GTPase Rheb is included in the introduction as it plays a role in the activation of mTORC1 after localization to the lysosome. While the paper is focused on the localization of mTORC1, its activation by GTPase Rheb may also be affected by this mechanism.",2024-12-05T23:03:05,dinasarsam,Dina Sarsam,,,,

This manuscript, authored by Aird et al., demonstrates that in both p16 knockdown cells and unperturbed cells, ATR increases lanosterol synthesis through de novo cholesterol synthesis, which promotes mTORC1 activity by lysosomal localization. They determined that this pathway consists of ATR, not ATM, and is independent of the CHK2 and TSC2 processes. The paper contains several major concerns, detailed below, that must be addressed before the data can be properly evaluated. Until these concerns are resolved the findings within the paper are unable to be thoroughly assessed, delaying our understanding of how ATR influences mTORC1 during DDR. The first major concern identified within the paper is the lack of orthogonal validation, specifically for Figure 4 A & B. This is a concern because, in order to validate the findings, different methods should be applied to confirm reliability, reproducibility and robustness. In Figure 4 A & B we are specifically relying on the visual trends to make a conclusion, which could be misinterpreted. The authors should perform Radiolabeled Cholesterol Uptake Assays which measure cell cholesterol absorbance by labeling cholesterol compounds with radioactive isotopes which would contribute to their orthogonal validation and help support their results. The second major concern is that phosphorylation of S6K is not limited to mTORC1. This is a major concern because S6K is a direct substrate for other kinases, such as JNK1 and PKC. Multiple validations are required to show that mTORC1 activity leads to the decrease in phosphorylation of S6K. One validation that can be conducted is to overexpress ATR to observe if phosphorylation of S6K increases, which would further support the direct link between mTORC1 activity and S6K phosphorylation. An additional validation is to conduct an in vitro kinase assay with mTORC1 and S6K to eliminate the possibility of confounding variables. The third major concern is that p16 expression can vary significantly between cell types. This is a major concern because HeLa cells have high levels of p16 expression, HEK293 cells have low levels of p16 expression unless under stress and MEFs have significantly higher levels of p16 as cells approach senescence. Quantifying the basal levels of p16 in each type of cell line is crucial since the focus is on ATR’s effect under basal conditions. This can be done by quantifying the levels of p16 through western blotting and testing if ATR affects mTORC1 similarly across varying expression levels. The first minor concern is that the quantification of the western blots is needed throughout the paper in order to substantially improve the clarity of the figures. The second minor concern would be to provide justification about the selection of the specific cell lines which would provide clarity on the major concerns related to varying p16 expression. The third minor concern is that the verbiage of mTORC1 should be consistent throughout the whole paper to increase readability and reduce confusion. The final minor concern is that Figure 3’s title is unclear; replacing “decreases” with “knockdown” would be more effective.",2024-12-05T22:37:23,cecyliaolivo,Cecylia Olivo,10.1101/2023.10.27.564195,ATR promotes mTORC1 activity via de novo cholesterol synthesis,"Naveen Kumar Tangudu, Alexandra N.

The manuscript by Ellis et al. investigates an alternative approach to systematically quantify transcription rate and mRNA stability using RATE-seq and SLAM-seq to further validate the relevance of miRNA loads among induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), neural progenitors (NPC), and neurons (Neu). This approach expands on the role of mRNA stability in shaping transcriptional buffering and driving 3’UTR lengthening via miRNA load. The paper suggests a comprehensive approach towards understanding the regulation of mRNA stability and transcription rates during human neurodevelopment. The use of RATE-seq as a technique for measuring half-life and transcription rates was a powerful and novel approach to dive deeper into the current understanding of this field, and could be applicable to future studies.   The authors also explore the idea of a mechanistic link between miRNA regulation and transcriptome changes. The reproducibility of results between cell types was reinforced that accumulation of miRNAs during neurodevelopment potentially leads to preferential degradation of short 3' UTR-containing mRNAs in neurons. The manuscript outlined the following findings about neuronal differentiating cells: i) mRNA stability and transcription rate play an equal role in establishing steady-state levels of the transcriptome, ii) buffering genes controlled by pluripotency transcription factors are regulated by mRNA stability, iii) increased miRNA load corresponds to mRNA degradation of most genes in neurons, and iv) preferential degradation of neuronal short 3’ UTR-containing mRNAs resulting in decreased RNA stability. These are not novel findings to the scientific community but the reproduction of previous research is not without merit. Reproducibility is a hallmark of quality scientific discovery.  However the novelty of this research is demonstrated in the unique sequencing protocols and statistical techniques utilized. Despite this achievement the paper doesn’t sufficiently expand the literature in such a way that qualifies it for publication. Given the issues outlined below, the manuscript must address the following concerns prior to acceptance for publication. One of the most pressing major concerns is the lack of a discernable attempt to close the gap in knowledge regarding the relationship between mRNA stability and transcriptional regulation during neurodevelopment. Specifically, the manuscript demonstrates the shifts in mRNA stability and 3’UTR lengthening. These results have already been documented in previous literature thus leaving unclear how this research advances the field and our understanding beyond known mechanisms. The question of whether miRNA load is sufficient or necessary to drive 3’UTR lengthening should be addressed in any future iterations of this paper. The authors could address this concern by designing an experiment to validate the causal relationship between increasing miRNA load and 3’ UTR lengthening. This can be achieved experimentally by overexpressing miRNA in human cell lines and tracking subsequent increases or decreases in 3’UTR lengthening. A second major concern that should ideally be remedied by the authors is the use of a single experimental cell line. To strengthen the quality of the research performed in this manuscript experiments should be orthogonally validated in other human cell lines. Justification of each cell line used should be explicitly mentioned in the manuscript. Additional tissue types can also be explored experimentally to strengthen the mechanistic link. The minor concern that needs to be addressed by the authors of Ellis et al. is the addition of a justification of the time points used during data collection. This context will allow readers more insight into the overall logic of the experiment. It is generally understood that the chosen time points are typical when working with neural cells but this logic may not be clear to an individual not actively involved in the field.",2024-12-05T03:18:42,,Arianna,,,,

SoxC transcription factors (Sox4, Sox11, Sox12) are identified as critical regulators of embryonic programs reactivated in CRC, driving tumor progression and poor patient survival. Using murine and organoid models, the authors elucidate SoxC-driven pathways influencing chromatin remodeling, proliferation, and metastasis. Despite robust experimental frameworks, translational gaps and underexplored mechanistic details need addressing. Major Revisions Mechanistic Elucidation Insufficient Detail on SoxC-Driven Programs: The role of SoxC in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation is well-documented. However, indirect targets (e.g., Mdk) require deeper exploration. Linking protein networks (e.g., Figure 3A) to specific cellular processes in tumor microenvironments would enhance clarity (Section: Results, p.7). Immune Modulation Underexplored: SoxC’s regulation of immune-related genes (e.g., Mif, Il19) is introduced but lacks functional validation. Including immune cell profiling from tumor environments or patient samples could substantiate claims (Section: Results, p.8). Clinical Relevance Translational Gaps: The manuscript emphasizes SoxC’s therapeutic potential but lacks direct discussion on pharmacological inhibitors. For example, the clinical applicability of targeting Tead2 or Mdk in CRC contexts remains speculative (Section: Discussion, p.10). Prognostic Model Validation: The SoxC-oncoembryonic signature is promising, but additional validation in independent, larger patient cohorts is essential to ensure reproducibility and clinical utility (Section: Results, p.9). Experimental Controls Baseline Comparisons for SoxC Inhibition: While SoxC-KO models demonstrate tumor suppression, parallel experiments using standard chemotherapies or combination treatments would provide comparative benchmarks (Section: Results, p.8). Hindgut Model Robustness: The embryonic hindgut model is compelling but differs significantly from adult tumor environments. Supplementary experiments incorporating human organoids or ex vivo models could address potential translational limitations (Section: Methods, p.11). Data Presentation and Statistical Rigor Incomplete Statistical Details: Kaplan-Meier analyses (e.g., Figure 3C) require hazard ratios and confidence intervals. Clarifying thresholds for “high” and “low” gene expression groups would strengthen interpretability. Underrepresented Raw Data: Additional raw data (e.g., ATAC-seq peaks, ChIP-seq binding sites) should be included to validate the claims of direct SoxC target regulation (Section: Results, p.6). Minor Revisions Typos and Formatting Figures: Figure legends occasionally omit critical methodological details (e.g., staining conditions in Figure 5A). Grammar: Line 154, ""which may be similarly drive CRC progression,"" should read ""which may similarly drive CRC progression."" AI Content Analysis Estimated AI-Generated Content: ~10-15%. Implications: Stylistically consistent but occasionally repetitive phrases (e.g., ""regulates both embryonic and cancerous programs"") suggest AI-assisted drafting. This does not detract from the scientific rigor but indicates potential areas for manual refinement. Terminology Consistency Key terms such as ""oncoembryonic genes"" and ""progenitor maintenance"" are inconsistently applied across sections. Standardizing definitions would aid clarity (e.g., Section: Introduction, p.2). Ethical and Methodological Transparency The manuscript references ethical approvals but omits details about humane endpoints for animal studies (Section: Methods, p.11). Expanding on regulatory compliance would ensure adherence to ethical standards. Citations References to foundational studies (e.g., Weinberg, 1996; Hanahan, 2022) should be balanced with more recent CRC-specific literature. Recommendations Mechanistic Depth: Incorporate RNA-seq or proteomic analyses to map SoxC interactions with immune pathways and chromatin regulators. Validate indirect target regulation (e.g., Mdk, Tead2) using perturbation assays. Clinical Insights: Expand discussion of SoxC inhibitors and therapeutic strategies, including potential combination therapies targeting chromatin remodeling. Data Enhancements: Provide supplementary raw datasets for reproducibility, including ATAC-seq peaks and Kaplan-Meier survival data.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.27.625706v1#comment-6604403219,biorxivstage,0,"Courtesy review from xPeerd.com Summary This manuscript investigates a novel locoregional therapy, MBC-005, targeting p21 induction via intratumoral percutaneous administration in BALB/c mice bearing breast cancer liver metastases. The work demonstrates a 3.9-fold increase in survival and tumor volume reduction through a hydrogel delivery system designed to mitigate hydrophobicity and enzymatic degradation of the active compound. While the study makes a strong case for MBC-005’s preclinical efficacy, there are gaps in experimental design, mechanistic exploration, and translational relevance. Major Revisions 1. Mechanistic Clarity The manuscript attributes MBC-005’s effects to p21 induction but does not sufficiently explain how this mechanism influences overall tumor microenvironment dynamics, such as angiogenesis or immune modulation. Including downstream effects of p21 upregulation (e.g., cell cycle arrest versus immune response interplay) would improve the study’s depth (Section: Results, p.8). Further exploration of how N-allyl noroxymorphone interacts with the opioid growth factor receptor, specifically in liver-specific metastases, is required to justify its locoregional application (Section: Discussion, p.11). 2. Experimental Controls Absence of Baseline Control for Locoregional Therapies: Comparative efficacy with locoregional standards like radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is missing. This would contextualize MBC-005’s potential advantages (Section: Results, p.7). Dose-Response Study Gaps: Although the study evaluates a range of MBC-005 doses, a detailed dose-response curve for survival benefit is absent. Highlighting toxicity thresholds across doses would strengthen the rationale for the selected therapeutic window (Section: Results, p.9). 3. Translation and Scalability Translational relevance remains underdeveloped. For example, the manuscript does not discuss challenges related to scaling hydrogel administration for clinical imaging systems or variability in tumor sizes (Section: Discussion, p.12). Specific limitations of murine liver tumor models compared to human liver metastases (e.g., perfusion, immune differences) should be acknowledged. 4. Reproducibility and Statistical Rigor The manuscript does not provide raw data or error ranges in figures showing critical in vivo findings (e.g., Figures 3, 10). The absence of confidence intervals or standard error bars undermines the reliability of these results. Statistical comparisons (e.g., Figure 9 survival curves) are inconsistently reported. Inclusion of hazard ratios and Kaplan-Meier plots with confidence intervals is needed. 5. Safety and Toxicity While the manuscript claims MBC-005 induces no off-target toxicity, details on off-target organ effects are insufficient. Clinical chemistry and histopathology for other critical organs (e.g., kidneys, spleen, heart) would provide a more comprehensive toxicity profile (Section: Results, p.10). 6. Ethical and Methodological Transparency Ethical approval processes are ambiguously described, particularly regarding animal welfare protocols. Details about analgesia and endpoint criteria for euthanasia in murine models are essential (Section: Methods, p.4). Specific imaging protocols for tumor measurement (e.g., ultrasound or bioluminescence imaging) lack clarity regarding resolution and reproducibility parameters. Minor Revisions 1. AI Content Analysis Estimated AI-Generated Content: ~20-25%. Detected Issues: Over-reliance on templated phrases, particularly in introductory and summary sections (e.g., ""poor prognosis; and, when treated with the standard of care systemic therapy they have a median survival of <9-months""). Impact: While these sections are stylistically consistent, they weaken the originality of argumentation. Rewriting these areas to reflect a more critical and nuanced understanding of literature would improve epistemic integrity. 2. Figures and Tables Some figures, such as Figure 10 (Kaplan-Meier survival curves), lack clarity and appropriate legends to describe their analytical methodology. Tables presenting survival metrics (e.g., Table III) should incorporate statistical significance indicators. 3. Terminology Consistency Terms like ""locoregional therapies"" and ""p21 induction"" are inconsistently defined across sections, leading to potential reader confusion. 4. Citations Certain key statements lack direct citation support (e.g., ""Locoregional therapies are appealing due to their minimally invasive nature""). Verify these with authoritative sources to enhance credibility (Section: Introduction, p.3). 5. Formatting and Typos Line 256: Repeated phrase ""was also shown to be significantly decreased."" Ensure uniform formatting of references (e.g., adherence to journal-specific citation styles). Recommendations Enhance Mechanistic Insights: Integrate RNA-seq or proteomic analyses to identify downstream signaling pathways influenced by p21 induction. Evaluate immune cell infiltration or cytokine profiling in treated tumors to investigate secondary effects. Address Limitations: Explicitly discuss how murine models differ from human metastases and any anticipated challenges in clinical translation. Improve Data Presentation: Add confidence intervals, raw data, and Kaplan-Meier analyses for survival metrics. Ensure all figures include clear legends, error bars, and scale descriptions. Augment Comparisons with Existing Therapies: Introduce comparative benchmarks with locoregional standards (e.g., RFA, PEI) to establish MBC-005’s potential superiority.

Here three non-ML algorithms are studied against one existing ML model — Random Forest (RF), which was directly trained to predict this physical property in a previous study. The results suggest physics-based simulations in general provide better estimates compared to the ML/structural-based methods when benchmarking to experimental measures, especially against distal mutations. Overall the manuscript is well-written and provides a sufficient amount of detail in each methodology used. Here are our comments: 1. The generalizability of the trained ML model is not immediately clear to us. It would be helpful if the author can include some data analyses on this model with the train/validation/test datasets in this manuscript to show the audience the performance of the model. How was the dataset different from Aldeghi et al. ACS central science 5, no. 8 (2019): 1468-1474? Will RF model predict better if it is trained on the Platinum database? Will a combination of Platinum database to data used in this manuscript improve the predicting ability of the model? 2. Following the previous comment, similar to neural nets, deep tree-based methods can be easily overfitted to the training data, is this also expected here?The NanoBRET vs. measurements in Hauser el al (2018) scatter plot and NanoBRET vs. RF plot look very similar to each other. Could that be evidence of overfitting to the dataset? Again it would be beneficial to present some results on model training. 3. As the authors summarized in the end, the physics-based simulation methods outperform structural/ ML-based methods. Does this mean by introducing structural descriptors to machine learning models, the predictions can be largely improved. This could be easily validated by retraining a RF model with additional (distal) features, which can be a valuable ML-based benchmark for future study. 4. While the authors provide a detailed investigation of the effects of forcefield selection in non-equilibrium perturbation (NEQ), the free energy calculations (FEP+) method does not seem well studied under various forcefield parameters. Is there a reason why OPLS was chosen for FEP+ and GAFF/CGenFF were selected for NEQ? If so, please elucidate. 5. The authors may want to comment on the utility of the training dataset from Hauser et al. (2018) given the importance of measuring the ΔΔG values for each TKI from a single measurement as demonstrated and alluded to in this paper. 6. Can the authors comment on the structural basis for the impact of distal mutations (Supp. Fig. 5, 6) which have a significant impact on inhibitor binding? It might also be useful to make a separate list for the identity of the mutated residue, their ΔΔG values, distance from the active site, RMSE and correlation values for these interesting mutations. 7. The RF model has been trained with mostly nearly-neutral point mutations. Is it expected to perform well for large-effect resistant or sensitive mutations for which experimental ΔΔG values are not within the 土1 kcal/mol range? 8. The authors assign a mutation as resistant if both the NanoBRET and computational approach predict an increase in ΔΔG by ΔΔG > +1 kcal/mol . What about the performance of the models on mutations for which the predicted -1 < ΔΔG  9. It is unclear if there are H-bond interactions between the water molecules within 0.4 nm from T315 and other chemical groups in the vicinity, such as backbone amides or a ligand atom. Are there features in the electron density map for the crystal structure of Abl kinase that indicate other water- mediated contacts in this site that might be disrupted by the T315A mutation? Minor points: 1. Term “singular point” in PRAUC plots is only mentioned in the caption of Figure 5, it would be good to have it mentioned and defined in the main text, followed by a discussion on its significance. 2.

This method facilitates continuous in vivo gene diversification and evolution, improving transformation efficiency and enabling the generation of large, diverse gene libraries. The study demonstrates this approach with mock nanobody libraries and shows promising potential for broader applications in protein engineering and yeast genetics. Major Revisions 1. Claim Confidence and Validation: - Doubts arise around the degree to which the claimed efficiency improvements can be generalized beyond the specific experimental parameters used. While TP901 integrase is shown to be highly effective, the generalizability to other integrases and diverse organism contexts needs further empirical validation. Citations within the document should more thoroughly delineate the extent and limitations observed in different experimental setups, ensuring that readers understand both the strengths and potential constraints of the approach. - The manuscript briefly mentions (in the introduction and results sections) comparative transformation efficiencies but lacks detailed statistical analysis and discussion on potential variances across different yeast strains or growth conditions. 2. Methodological Transparency: - The preprint should provide more detailed step-by-step protocols, especially for the transformation and sorting processes, to improve reproducibility. Information such as specific buffer compositions, incubation times, and electroporation settings would greatly benefit other researchers attempting to replicate the findings. - The current data representation (e.g., Fig. S1, S2) should go beyond simple efficiency comparisons and instead include discussions on potential confounding factors or biases that could have influenced observed results. 3. Data Integration and Interpretation: - The interpretation of multiple integrations per cell should include discussions around the biological implications of such events and how they might influence long-term genome stability and gene expression profiles in yeast cells. - Consideration of any unintended off-target effects or genomic instabilities caused by high-frequency integrase activity should be examined more comprehensively. Minor Revisions 1. Typos and Formatting Issues: - Correct minor typographical errors such as ""chromitinization"" which should be ""chromatinization"". - Maintain consistency in the citation format and ensure that all figures and tables are accurately referenced within the text. 2. AI Content Analysis: - It is estimated that approximately 10-15% of the text could have been influenced by AI-generated content, specifically in highly repetitive methodological details and generalized scientific language. These sections might benefit from further scrutiny to ensure precision and contextual specificity. Recommendations 1. Empirical Validation: Conduct additional empirical studies across various yeast strains and potentially other model organisms to validate and extend the utility of the TP901 integrase-mediated integration strategy. 2. Protocol Detail Enhancement: Provide more comprehensive methodological details and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to assist in replication and application. 3. In-depth Statistical Analysis: Include detailed statistical analyses for transformation efficiency data and other quantitative results. 4. Extended Discussions: Broaden discussions on possible biological implications, off-target effects, and the broader impact on genomic stability to anticipate and address potential challenges in practical applications. 5. Enhanced Figures and Tables: Ensure that all supplemental figures and tables are adequately referenced and described in the main text to aid in data transparency and comprehension. By addressing these recommendations, the manuscript can improve both its scientific robustness and practical utility, greatly enhancing its value to the research community interested in gene library integration and continuous evolution methodologies.",2024-12-01T12:54:07,xpeerd,xPeer,10.1101/2024.11.29.626108,Ultra-Efficient Integration of Gene Libraries onto Yeast Cytosolic Plasmids,"Alexander Pisera, Yutong Yu, Rory L Williams, Chang C Liu",2024-11-30

The approach employs lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)-based mRNA therapeutics to transiently overexpress P-gp in cardiomyocytes, reducing intracellular Dox levels and associated cytotoxic effects, both in vitro and in vivo. The study demonstrates promising results, including enhanced survival rates and improved cardiac function in treated mice and pigs. However, detailed analysis and validation in clinical settings are needed. Major Revisions 1. Ethics and Concerns on mRNA Technology: The preprint does not provide comprehensive information on the long-term safety and potential mutagenic effects of repeated mRNA administration. Although the authors claim no potential insertion mutagenesis, a detailed toxicological assessment must be included. - Example: The long-term impact on genomic stability has been vaguely mentioned (Section: Results, Page 6) but needs further elaboration. 2. Effectiveness on Large Animal Models: While the study highlights the preliminary success in pigs, it lacks comprehensive physiological data, myocardial histopathology, and the functional impact across different heart failure stages. - Example: The pig model data is summarized, but detailed statistical analysis and larger sample size validation are crucial (Discussion, Page 7). 3. Broader Relevance and Risk Mitigation: The potential immunogenicity of LNPs and mRNA therapeutics should be discussed to address the broader clinical relevance and possible adverse immune responses. - Example: Immune response considerations are barely discussed (Page 10), which is critical for clinical translation. Recommendations 1. Enhance Toxicology and Safety Data: Include detailed data on the longitudinal impact of mRNA administration, focusing on potential genomic stability issues and systemic safety profiles. Consider supplementary studies evaluating mutagenic and oncogenic risks. 2. Comprehensive Animal Model Studies: Expand the large animal model studies to include a broader sample size and various cardiovascular conditions, supplemented with detailed histopathological analyses. 3. Immune Response Mitigation: Address potential immunogenicity by conducting comprehensive immunological assessments on treated animals and documenting any adverse reactions. Present a risk mitigation strategy for the clinical setting. 4. Expanded Clinical Relevance Exploration: Provide a more robust discussion on how to adapt the TopCare strategy to different cancer treatments, varying dosages, and combined therapies to ensure broader applicability. Minor Revisions 1. Textual and Formatting Errors: - Correct minor typographical errors and ensure consistent formatting across sections.

I keenly followed the Conceptual Penis hoax (Boghossian and Lindsay) as it unfolded in real time as I was writing my book on predatory publishing. Although it initially correctly stated that the Conceptual Penis hoax as exposing gender studies, he later says they published in a predatory journal. This is incorrect. There were peer review problems but no predatory publishing. They submitted the article to a prestigious gender studies journal, NORMA: International Journal for Masculinity Studies, from Taylor and Francis. The journal rejected the article and transferred the article down to another T & F lower-tier open access journal, Cogent Social Sciences. This editorial process is called “cascading.”  The less prestigious journal peer-reviewed it and, when it was accepted, requested an APC. After publication, the authors revealed the hoax, and the article was retracted; the journal explained that the peer reviewers for the lower tier publication lacked experience.

At least it is now demonstrated. I however have some doubt about the host range analysis, because the methods applied are not very clear. It is written that the host range was assigned with COPLA (l.159). But I guess that the host range inferred by COPLA includes all  plasmids in their database for each PTU, including some containing AMR genes. So in the last (and most important) section of the manuscript, removing the ARG-carrying plasmids from the AMR+ PTUs will not change the host range classification given by COPLA. This bring an inconsistency between the given host range and the actual plasmids in the 118 ARG-free PTUs investigated. My feeling is that the rare grade V+VI PTUs are actually caused by ARG carriage, bringing a great fitness advantage in very distant bacterial hosts in which plasmids should otherwise struggle to maintain because of maladaptation. It will be necessary I think to calculate the host range only with the data investigated in the study, simply by looking at the plasmid's host taxonomy and not rely on COPLA results. Like this it can be calculated independently for the various sets of PTUs (with/without pAMR). Other samll comment : in figure 2 355 PTUs containing 13,048 plasmids are given in top panl but less than 8000 plasmids and 50 PTUs are given in bottom panel, and it is not indicated what was the display threshold in bottom panel.

All the members of the group, including external guests, are acknowledged for participating in the discussion and providing feedback that was useful to prepare this report. The corresponding author of the original manuscript was consulted before posting this report. Summary The authors introduce a method to perform maximum entropy reweighting of molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, specifically addressing the choice of regularization parameters. Interestingly, an automatic procedure to determine the relative strength of the regularization terms acting on different experimental datapoints is proposed. The method is then applied to extensive MD simulations of 5 intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) using 3 different force fields. For 3 of the tested IDPs, different simulations converge to the similar ensembles after reweighting. For the other 2, the ensemble overlap is too limited, and the reweighted ensemble is significantly force-field dependent. We are mostly interested in the methodological part of the paper. Technical innovations are: * The idea of including the statistical error of the MD, as computed with block analysis, in the regularization term. * The idea of performing preliminary regularization scans for individual sets of experiments to tune the relative uncertainty, and ultimately end up with a single parameter (prefactor) to be tuned. * The idea of tuning the parameters monitoring the Kish sample size. To our knowledge, the comparative results for the 5 IDPs and 3 force fields are also new and very relevant. Comments * Could there be some speculation by the authors on the relative role of the water model and of the protein force field? The way results are presented, it is not clear if the reason for the discrepancies is in the protein force field or in the water model. Maybe it is not possible to disentangle them. * The authors evaluate the errors of the employed forward models by applying the Flyvbjerg block analysis method, which only estimates statistical errors, without keeping into account possible systematic errors in the forward models themselves. We would suggest to clarify it in the text. * In many sentences of the main text, the authors use the word ""weight"" to refer both to the statistical weight of each frame in the trajectory and to the strength of the experimental restraints. To avoid undesired misunderstandings, we suggest to use words like ""strength"" or ""confidence"" of the experimental data/restraints etc. * Figure 2B is unexpected. The authors used the derivation from Cesari et al JCTC (2016) to introduce uncertainty in the experimental observation. This is formally equivalent to BioEn (Koefinger and Hummer, 2015) if the theta hyperparameter is set to 1. If we understood correctly how the global scaling was applied, its scan would correspond to a scan over theta in the BioEn formalism. When doing so, it can be proven analytically that the chi^2 should be a monotonic function of the regularization hyperparameter. Hence, when the authors decrease sigma_global, the average RMSE should decrease monotonically. However, in the figure all the reported RMSEs seem to be increasing for sigma → 0, so their average will increase. This seems inconsistent. Is this related to some issues with the minimization process (e.g., minimizations with a very low sigma are not converging)? Or is there something we misunderstood in the explanation? * The perfect match of the SAXS data for PaaA2 for the AMBER force field (before reweighting) is striking. Was perhaps the force field optimized using this system as a reference? If so, we would suggest to mention this in the text. * “An IDP ensemble containing ten consecutive residues [...] neighboring residues”. This is super interesting. Could the author explicitly compute this and show it? We believe it is a very interesting example of what can be observed in an MD simulation and not in a bulk experiment, and so it would be relevant to know if the answer is force field dependent or not. For instance, one could plot a 2D map with DDG associated to the helical content. * The authors quantify the similarity of two ensembles by computing the normalized overlap integral of the kernel densities in the ELViM latent space. This quantity is, by construction, sensitive to this particular choice of the ensemble representation, based on the C\alpha carbon atoms, which is in effect a dimensionality reduction. We agree that it is in practice unfeasible to evaluate the similarity between ensembles sampled in different MD simulations using quantities that do not rely on dimensionality reduction. However, when comparing reweighted with unbiased ensembles, we expect the Kish sample size to be relatively low (around 0.1), whereas the shown density overlap S is high (>0.66 for all the examined IDPs - values along the diagonal in Fig. 8B). Does this happen because the employed dimensionality reduction (based on C\alpha carbon atoms) focuses more on some robust part of the structural ensembles, preserved by the reweighting? Or is it because two different (possibly uncomparable) metrics are used? * The authors comment that leave-one-out cross validation should not be used with correlated data, and claim that this is the reason for the unexpected good performance of cross validation in Figure 2C. This is very interesting as, to our knowledge, has not been seen before. Adding more points in the low-Kish-size region might be interesting. * At some point the authors write ""We note a conceptual similarity of the reweighting procedure proposed here with the concept of gentle ensemble refinement in the recently published work of Kofinger and Hummer.32 "" We believe the authors meant to cite Ref. 33 rather than Ref. 32.",2024-11-22T19:56:01,giovannibussi,Giovanni Bussi,10.1101/2024.10.04.616700,"Towards accurate, force field independent conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins","Kaushik Borthakur, Thomas R.

During the RNA/Chimera annealing step, you applied “The samples were incubated at 95℃ for 1 minute and transferred to ice immediately.” However, the original study of Nm-VAQ and other similar experiments usually use gradient and slow cooling to ensure that the RNA and chimera have sufficient time to specifically bind rather than preferentially form secondary structures on their own, thereby affecting the subsequent cleavage of RNase H. This may be the reason for the ‘background’ described in this study and the much higher level of Nm modification seen in Fig 3C than the results in the original article. 2.	In page 7, “PLXNB2, RPL10, and TOP1 were identified as potential candidates for mRNAs with Nm modifications based on various mapping techniques. G498 for PLXNB2, G150 for RPL10, and U877 for TOP1 were the potential sites of 2’-O-methylation”, which only cited reference 29. However, we found ref 29 only reported PLXNB2 as a potential Nm site.

While it provides valuable data, the study has limitations that affect the coherence between its main objective and results. The title and introduction suggest a focus on neurotropic viruses associated with epilepsy linked to Onchocerca volvulus (OAE), but the results primarily describe viral diversity without providing evidence of these viruses. Possible explanations for the absence of neurotropic viruses are not discussed, nor are methodological alternatives proposed to address this issue. To improve the narrative, it is recommended to reframe the title and present the work as an exploratory study on viral diversity in blackflies. Methodologically, the sample size (10 blackflies per pool) and the lack of information about the genus of the collected blackflies compromise the representativeness of the data. Additionally, the criteria for excluding incomplete sequences are inconsistent, as incomplete Riboviria sequences were retained, potentially biasing abundance results. Regarding the figures, Figure 2 lacks a clear description of its columns, hindering interpretation. Figure 3 presents phylogenetic trees with barely distinguishable details, complicating analysis. In Figure 4, the point corresponding to Blackfly flavivirus does not clearly cluster with invertebrate hosts, weakening conclusions about its specificity. Analyses based on PCA and dinucleotide composition are interesting but insufficient to infer viral tropism without experimental validation. The supplementary files, although relevant, lack proper descriptions, and the main text does not specify which supplementary figure to consult, limiting their utility. Although the study does not successfully address its main objective, it provides an important starting point for future research on the viral diversity of blackflies and highlights the need for further investigation into their relationship with human diseases in endemic areas.",2024-11-19T16:24:35,jesusvalencianavarro,Jesus Valencia,,,,

The study is very interesting and makes a significant contribution to the field of animal communication, especially by providing a quantitative approach to chimpanzee behavior. However, I have identified a few aspects that could be improved to make the report clearer and more accessible. First, the text refers to a ""Table 2,"" but this table does not appear in the report, which could cause confusion for readers. This might be an issue of incorrect enumeration or an omission, so I would recommend reviewing and correcting this to ensure consistency in data presentation. Regarding the figures, while the information is clear and understandable, some of them could benefit from adjustments in formatting to improve their visual presentation. For instance, in Figure 4, the axes are generically labeled as “X” and “Y”; it would be helpful if these were more specifically defined to aid in interpretation. Additionally, the axis titles are in lowercase, which could be standardized for consistency. In Figure 6, the title is not centered, and some axis subtitles and the legend do not follow the proper formatting, which may make them harder to read. In Figure 8, the abbreviation “NB” is used without an explanation, which could cause ambiguity for readers unfamiliar with the term. Lastly, I believe it would be useful to include a section for keywords, as they are crucial for indexing and searching for the article, thus improving its accessibility and understanding. The work is of high quality, and with these small adjustments, it could further enhance its presentation and clarity.

We greatly appreciate your constructive comments, which help us improve our research. Regarding your concerns about the purity of circRNA purified using oligo dT, we want to emphasize that our purification protocol has been meticulously optimized to minimize the presence of introns and precursor RNA fragments. We were unable to detect any precursors on electrophoresis. Concerning the in vitro expression results, we understand your surprise that circRNA purified with the RNA kit exhibited higher expression levels compared to HPLC-purified circRNA. We are currently investigating potential factors that might influence these outcomes. To address your concerns more directly and transparently, we would be pleased to send you a sample of our purified circRNA. This will allow you to conduct your own tests and comparisons, which we hope will validate the effectiveness of our purification methods and provide additional confidence in our results.",2024-11-18T07:43:31,estherbroset,Esther Broset,10.1101/2024.10.28.620632,A complete approach for circRNA therapeutics from purification to lyophilized delivery using novel ionizable lipids,"Esther Broset, Verónica Lampaya, Ana Larraga, Víctor Navarro, Alexandre López, Diego de Miguel, Álvaro Peña, Juan Martínez-Oliván, Diego Casabona",2024-10-28

The study supports the concept that sleep is a conserved biological function and evolutionarily distinct new features have developed later. The findings that the genes associated with energy metabolism and cellular repair, which play a primordial role of sleep in cellular maintenance in the Lokiarchaeota, suggest the origin and evolutionary purpose of sleep. The results are in line with the previous assumptions regarding the restorative and protective functions of sleep, including cellular maintenance and gene protection. Moreover, such researches can provide valuable information for drug development as conservation and evolutionary background of genes linked to disease could lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. This work has used both phylogenomics and bioinformatics to solve a biological problem. This research illustrates the scope of such studies in finding solutions to many biological problems. Why sleep is necessary and is maintained by evolution is not fully answered. From an evolutionary standpoint, phylogenetic approaches would help to unravel some of the unresolved mysteries of nature. The phylogenomics approach to sleep science is rather new, but combining phylogenomics and bioinformatics research on a range of species may help in understanding facts which are still unknown.",2024-11-17T07:22:07,velyudhanmohankumar,Velyudhan Mohan Kumar,10.1101/2024.11.01.621620,Unraveling the Mysteries of Sleep: Exploring Phylogenomic Sleep Signals in the Recently Characterized Archaeal Phylum Lokiarchaeota near Loki’s Castle,"Seithikurippu R Pandi-Perumal, Konda Mani Saravanan, Sayan Paul, David Warren Spence, Saravana Babu Chidambaram",2024-11-03
