The initiative to include new species of deer as an experimental model to verify susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 is of remarkable importance. The susceptibility and virological surveillance analyses involving the white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus) have demonstrated the potential spillover of SARS-CoV-2 into wildlife. However, this appears to be just the tip of the iceberg. By adopting new species of deer as a susceptibility model, similar to your approach, we can better predict new scenarios involving SARS-CoV-2. According to your results, it is concerning to learn about the potential susceptibility of mule deer and their ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 with real infection capacity, whereas we observed that elk have lower susceptibility to this virus. In an analysis involving deer ACE2 protein sequences ( https://doi.org/10.1007/s10..., I compared the binding sites that SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter the host cell. The mule deer shares the same binding sites with the WTD, while the elk has a different site, in addition to the evolutionary distance with the deer of the genus Odocoileus. I argued that this variation in an ACE2 binding site could decrease elk susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. It appears that our results corroborate each other. I conclude my comment here by congratulating you on the interesting work and publication by your group.

The algorithm's greedy methodology for finding incongruence in phylogenetic trees under a gamma site heterogeneity model means the algorithm will misclassify punctuated equilibria and variable rates of evolution as recombination events. To illustrate this, the authors need only run this algorithm on mammalian mitochondrial DNA or SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected after 2021. Using their methodology, it wouldn't surprise me if they estimate humans & chimps diverged 100,000 years ago or SARS-CoV-2 arose in late 2020. If you reconstructed a recombinant common ancestor for mammalian mitochondrial DNA that clearly do not recombine, you would greedily construct a common ancestor that appears more like humans than the actual common ancestor by allowing the human genome to define its closest relatives at every small segment of the mitochondrial genome, thereby reducing the genetic distance between humans and its ""RecCA"". Like Pekar et al.'s use of an HIV model of superspreading and unbiased case ascertainment to claim two basal polytomies implies two spillover events, this paper is an unstable stack of methods poorly understood by the authors applied to achieve the desired conclusions, when a modicum of attention to detail can quickly reveal the fatal limitations of their analysis. There are ~1,100 substitutions separating RaTG13 - collected in 2013 - from SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019. SARS-CoV-2 acquired ~25 mutations per year when it was spreading in the far larger global human population and there is little to no evidence that bats suffer chronic infections that would accelerate this rate. Consequently, there are ~44 years of evolution separating SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, slightly fewer for BANAL-52. The authors' complex stack of models, each with clear limitations and biases known to those who make such models, hides this obvious arithmetic fact that contradicts their conclusions.",2023-08-04T16:27:45,,Edward Holmes,10.1101/2023.07.12.548617,The recency and geographical origins of the bat viruses ancestral to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,"Jonathan E.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.23.521658v2#comment-6246296575,biorxivstage,0,"The recently published description of the Coding-Variant Allelic-Series Test (COAST) is presented as if the method were novel, whereas in fact the approach is in principle identical to the method of weighted burden analysis implemented in GENEVARASSOC and SCOREASSOC, which was first published in 2016 (1,2). The authors of the new paper write: ""We define an allelic series as a collection of variants in which increasingly deleterious mutations lead to increasingly large phenotypic effects, and we have developed a gene-based rare-variant association test specifically targeted to identifying genes containing allelic series."" (1) The paper first describing the application of the weighted burden test stated that ""weights were also allocated according to the effect of the variant"" and provided a table documenting how increasingly deleterious mutations were assigned increasingly large weights (2). Since then, the weighted burden test has been used in several published analyses of exome sequence data, including of the same UK Biobank dataset which was used for the COAST analyses (3). It is striking that it is reported in the abstract that ""COAST detects associations, such as that between ANGPTL4 and triglycerides"" while there is no citation to my own paper using the same dataset which explicitly reported that the weighed burden test detected association between ANGPLT4 and hyperlipidaemia, although admittedly this did not reach exome-wide significance (4). Application of the weighted burden test has however yielded other novel gene discoveries which are exome-wide significant (5,6). There is also a published exploration of the performance of different weighting schemes (7). When one method implements an approach that is at least similar to one already published, it is customary to refer to the pre-existing approach and discuss differences. Sometimes a formal comparison of performance may be carried out. Describing the earlier work allows the readership to put the new work in context. However the paper describing COAST fails to cite any of the papers describing or utilising weighted burden analysis. References 1.

There is abundant evidence that each of these languages are based on a variety of natural languages, as attested by the creators of the languages themselves. See e.g. https://www.daytranslations... regarding the creation of Dothraki by David Peterson. Here are some relevant quotes: ""Using words from obscure and exotic languages and the words originally written by Martin, Peterson developed several words and sentences, including attaching prefixes and suffixes to many of the words. He followed how nouns are formed in Swahili and studied the negative forms of verbs in the Estonian language among other languages he used as references, such as Russian, Turkish and Inuktitut. From his initial list of 1,700 words, he was able to expand the Dothraki vocabulary to 10,000."" ""According to Peterson himself, you can see the influences of Arabic and Spanish languages in Dothraki language."" This is true for each of the languages assessed in this paper.

The following is a summary of our conversation with two of the authors of this preprint. The discussion on this preprint by Dr. Daniel Keedy and Virgil Woods revolved around the unexpected changes observed in protein dynamics upon ligand binding, as revealed through Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS). The researchers used this technique to compare two different types of ligands, and their key figure, a rainbow map, illustrates the differences in HDX reaction rates over time. Red residues indicate increased HDX exchange, suggesting higher solvent accessibility and conformational changes, while blue areas represent either distinct conformational changes or the binding interface. The researchers expressed excitement about receiving feedback on how their HDX approach reveals additional information over methods such as crystallography. They also expressed some concern about potential confusion regarding the interpretation of exchange rates and the benefits of HDX over crystallography. They are particularly interested in feedback from scientists who are familiar with analyzing HDX data with alternative software that can incorporate EX1 kinetics. Looking forward, the team plans to collect and analyze more data from HDX and crystallography of small molecule allosteric modulators, focusing on the L-16 site, a less conserved part of the PTP1B structure. In future work, they want to explore other identified binders, but only a few have shown an effect. HDX will be important because they have also struggled to obtain crystal structures and aim to determine where binding is occurring and identify inhibitors. They also plan to study new mutations. This preprint presents a fascinating exploration of protein dynamics upon ligand binding, and the researchers' approach of using HDX-MS offers a unique perspective. The community is encouraged to provide feedback, particularly on the interpretation of HDX data and the potential benefits of this technique over crystallography.",2023-08-01T19:44:42,maddyrostad,Madeleine Rostad,10.1101/2023.07.12.548582,Native dynamics and allosteric responses in PTP1B probed by high-resolution HDX-MS,"Virgil A.

The preclinical data presented doesn't appear to support the clinical study fro the following reasons. Clinically the study is stated as comparing 6 cycles given every 3 weeks of fixed dose of carboplatin versus adaptive therapy arm which is also 6 cycles but where the choice of dose is based on CA-125 dynamics, with N of 40 per arm.  ( Note, as an aside it must be noted that on clinicaltrials.gov there is no mention of how the dose will be adpated based on CA-125 dynamics - there is also no protocol and so no understanding of the size of effect that the study is powered to capture.) Preclinically the authors gave 60mg/kg once every 4 days for 3 doses in the standard of care arm but allowed weekly dosing for up to 20 weeks.  This is not a like for like comparison!  The standard of care arm should have had fxed dose weekly for the 20 weeks. This would have best mimicked the clinical trial they propose as the schedule is fixed only teh dose is changed.  Thus the data does not support the clinical trial being proposed. Furthermore there are other issues with the preclinical study, discussed below. The authors chose to randomise 2 mice to the vehicle and 2 mice to the continuous therapy but 3-5 to the adaptive therapy. (Note, two tumours were grown on each mice.)  This is a really odd design fro a preclinical study, the uncertainty around the size of effect between the arms will be large and add to that the continuous and adaptive doses are not comparable with regards to schedule. Next, it appears the tumour take was not all that successful in general. In Figure 4 B top-panel we see that the tumour were not growing conosistently from one measurement to teh next at tiem of randomisation.  This is evident by looking at the vehicle arm where post randomisation 3 of the mice are not growing at all for a few weeks post time 0 with one never growing at all and simply remaining constant.  Continue down to the middle panel the vehicle looks really odd, we have two tumours out of the 4 not growing properly at all with one spontaneously shrinking after about 4 weeks.  These issues in the vehicle group imply the cell-line chosen has not taken propoerly in the mice.  It suggests little work was done to understand the optimal conditions for the cell-line to grow well on the back of teh mice.  With such erratic control are much larger N would be needed to ascertain differences between different dosing regimens. It is somewhat worrying that such preclinical studies are being used to support Phase 2 RCTs.  It does not appear the preclinical study informed the clinical study design and that the preclinical study itself was not designed appropriately to assess if adaptive dosing is superior to continuous.",2023-07-28T08:26:09,,Hitesh Mistry,10.1101/2023.07.21.549688,Adaptive therapy achieves long-term control of chemotherapy resistance in high grade ovarian cancer,"Helen Hockings, Eszter Lakatos, Weini Huang, Maximilian Mossner, Mohammed Ateeb Khan, Stephen Metcalf, Francesco Nicolini, Kane Smith, Ann-Marie Baker, Trevor A.

One question I had was whether the CAIS would change much if dataset independent values of Fa (the frequency of amino acid 'a' across the entire dataset of 118 vertebrate genomes in your analysis) were used. For instance, would the resulting CAIS change much if each Fa was set to 0.05? I believe this is the only variable that could make CAIS hard to compare across species in different datasets (e.g., if different Fa values were used when computing CAIS for those species). Also, I was a bit confused at times about whether 'frequency' referred to the counts of instances vs. the proportions of instances. I believe it is the proportion in all cases, but could be good to specify if you are revising another draft prior to publication.

The following is a summary of our conversation with two of the authors of this preprint. The conversation with Dr. Kevin Gardner and Danielle Swingle revolved around their research on the diversity of function and higher-order structure within HWE sensor histidine kinases. The key point of their preprint is the exploration of the variability in this family of histidine kinases, challenging the conventional understanding that they need to be membrane-bound or always exist as dimers. Their research has identified monomers, constitutive dimers, and proteins that fluctuate between these states. Interestingly, they found a light-sensitive histidine kinase that is active in the dark, contrary to expectations of the rest of the family. The figure they are most proud of presents different clusters of homologs of the light-activated monomer that their lab discovered in 2014, clustering into three different families. It also includes two models: one of a monomer sensing kinase and another of a dimer sensing kinase. The authors appreciated the feedback they received on their initial preprint, which was submitted through eLife. The feedback was constructive and inspired them to revise their work post-Covid, resulting in the current Version 2 of the preprint. Potential areas of confusion might arise from their efforts to engineer a monomeric HK based on their discoveries, specifically in distinguishing the different regions between the monomer/dimer swap. They also highlighted the value of preprints in facilitating dialogue about emerging science, offering a balance between the immediacy of social media and the lengthy review process of traditional publishing. Looking forward, they are interested in exploring reverse signaling proteins and their intriguing dynamics and structural components. This research offers a fresh perspective on histidine kinases, challenging conventional understanding and opening up new avenues for exploration.

I believe that this manuscript is largely based on a missunderstanding of the nature of ATAC-seq data. It is important that people processing ATAC-seq data with MACS use single end mode, together with the `--no-model`, `--extsize` and `--shift` options. In correct usage of tools can easily lead to sub-optimal results. The MACS tool was original built to analyse ChIP-seq data when most sequencing data was single-ended, and the use of it in the default single-end mode when the data is pair-ended, can indeed lead to results that could be better if the full data set was considered. In ChIP-seq DNA is fragmented, and then fragments that are bound by a protein factor are isolated by immunoprecipitation. The protein factor could be bound at any place in the recovered fragment, but we only sequence the ends. Because fragmentation positions are random, we can look at the genome positions that are covered by the most fragments, and identify them as the most likely binding positions for the protein factor of interest. Because a protein factor could be bound anywhere in a fragement, it is imporant to know the extent of the fragment. In the days of single-end sequencing, this could only be achieved by guess work, and clever statistics. An average fragment size would be estimated from the data, and single end reads extended to cover this. But this was always only a guess. With pair-ended data this guess work is unneccessary, as we know where the ends are. So if you have paired-end ChIP-seq data, and use single end mode in MACS2, you are a) discarding half the data, and b) making a guess at fragment length when you don't need to guess. However, ny guess is that in practice the differences are fairly minor. However, this manuscript is based not on ChIP-seq data, but on ATAC-seq data and ATAC-seq data is fundementally different in nature.  In ATAC-seq we use a transposase to create DNA fragments by ""transposing"" a sequencing adaptor into the genome. Since the transposase can only attack nucleosome free DNA, we can use the locations of transposition to identify regions of open chromatin. Whereas in ChIP-seq we are trying to identify a single location, which, for a single-fragment, could be anywhere in that fragment, in ATAC-seq we know exactly where the location of interest is for any fragment. Actaully there are two locations of interest, and they are located exactly at either end of the fragment. The area inbetween these two ends is of no interest. In ATAC-seq, rather than read pairs being connected to come up with a candidate region for protein binding (as in ChIP-seq), they are two seperate, independent, and unconnected samples from all open-chromatin locations in the genome, and should be treated thus. Consider the following situation with two nucleosome free regions and some ATAC reads (* marks closed chormatin, - open) |>>> |>>> |>>> |>>>         <<<| *********|---------|*********|---------|********* Using MACS in paired end mode would lead to the following depth profile: ############## ################## ####################### ########################### *********|---------|*********|---------|********* That is, the two nucleosome free regions are merged into a single extended peak. However, if we use the standard ATAC-seq approach of treating each read as independent (either map both ends as single ended, or map paired-end and then alter flags to mark all reads as read1), shift the read 3' by X bases and then extend the read by 2X bases to get this: |>>>>>|                  | |>>>>>|                  | |>>>>>|         | |>>>>>|         | *********|---------|*********|---------|********* And then with MACS2 in `--no-model` mode, you would get this depth profile: ## #                ###### ###########           ######## ###############       ############ *********|---------|*********|---------|********* That is there are two peaks, that more or less match the two open chromatin regions.",2023-07-21T14:08:39,ian_sudbery,Ian Sudbery,10.1101/496521,Improved peak-calling with MACS2,John M.

Such a diversity, and putative inheritance from the father with dementia at the age of 83, suggests that additional factors may be required to result in AD, at least before the age of 70-75, knowing that LOAD is very common. This variant may not be sufficient, to my opinion, to cause AD, although it seems to be a strong determinant. I also found interesting to see that we also have the same variant as in this work, in one of our (unpublished) patients (R953C). It is a sporadic case with an age at onset of 56 years, APOE genotype 3-4, unaffected parents at 80, large family, no other case except a paternal grandmother with an age at onset of 80. Unless there is a de novo mutation, which we could not check yet, it is not consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. I hope we can see if one of the parents is a carrier or not, as this will help us better understand the penetrance of the variant. This paper adds another variant to the increasing list of variants with a maturation defect. We previously reported 15 variants with a similar effect in a previous paper (Rovelet-Lecrux et al., Acta Neuropathologica Communications 2021) after expression of 70 missense variants in HEK cells. We selected 3 variants with such an effect and 2 without, to further evaluate them in IPSCs after Crispr/cas9 introduction, and found that all three selected missense variants showed a maturation defect, including one with a milder effect. The 2 variants with the strongest maturation defect showed significantly increased secreted Abeta levels, clearly linking these variants to AD pathophysiology. It is however not clear why, in the current paper, the authors mention our own by paper with the following sentence: ""Furthermore, a larger screen of 70 SORL1 coding variants suggested that impaired maturation may be general for dysfunctional proteins although no correlation to AD was established."" We only studied SORL1 and we showed a direct link with AD for these specific variants, with the above-mentioned mechanism.

The following is a summary of our conversation with one of the authors of this preprint. Dr. Lauren Porter's discussion focused on her research on the evolutionary selection of proteins that can assume different folds, particularly in response to stimuli. The key point of the preprint is the prediction of sequence features for fold-switching proteins, which undergo relatively dramatic secondary and tertiary structure changes. They specifically study homologs that switch from an alpha-helical to a beta-sheet state, a significant change. Their research suggests that fold-switching is not random but is evolutionarily selected, a finding that challenges current understanding in the field. Dr. Porter’s favorite figure connects different sequence alignments with the helical and beta sheet structures, identifying positions in the alignment that make unique contacts to the beta sheet fold and the alpha sheet fold. Dr. Porter is particularly interested in feedback on their argument that evolution selects for these proteins and makes them different. She acknowledged that some of the figures might be hard to interpret for different communities (e.g. evolutionary biologists might find some protein structure aspects confusing and some of the evolutionary insights to be obvious, whereas structural biologists might be surprised by some of the evolutionary biology). Looking forward, they plan to use these results to build on existing methodology to reliably predict two folds from one sequence. They hope to achieve this within the next year. Dr. Porter also shared her thoughts on the preprinting system, discussing the complications around reviewing preprints and benchmarking against methods that have not yet been peer-reviewed. She also expressed how having more accountability in terms of commenting and making changes to preprints could elevate the scientific discourse. This preprint presents a novel perspective on the evolutionary selection of fold-switching proteins.

The following is a summary of our conversation with one of the authors of this preprint. Dr. Lauren Jackson's discussion focused on her research on the interaction between β’-COP and the ArfGAP, Glo3, and its role in maintaining post-Golgi cargo recycling. The key point of the preprint is the identification of how a key regulatory molecule (a GAP protein) regulates an important membrane trafficking co-complex. They knew these two elements interacted, but pinpointing where the interaction was happening among the seven subunits was challenging. They identified specific amino acids and tested predictions in a yeast model system. The figure they are most proud of, Figure 4, was improved through peer review, as reviewers requested an additional experiment to be conducted in cells. This figure demonstrated the interaction from both perspectives. Dr. Jackson was excited to get the preprint out there, as it allowed her to attend an online conference and gain visibility during a challenging time. She also found preprints to be beneficial for grant applications. Most of the feedback they received came from peer review, and the preprint story differs from the final published version as they took out a crystal structure and turned it into its own paper during the review process. Potential areas of confusion might arise from the fact that they never nailed down the structure of the interaction between β’-COP and Glo3. They faced technical challenges and some methods suggested by reviewers had already been attempted but were unsuccessful and were outlined in the correspondence with the reviewers coordinated by the journal. Looking forward, they plan to do more structural biology to get the supercomplex (potentially by tomography or by moving in the nanodisc direction, having done some work on tubules). Dr. Jackson shared her positive experiences with preprints, noting their importance and the benefit of having a pool of reviewers.

The following is a summary of our conversation with one of the authors of this preprint. Dr. Alex Guseman's discussion centered on his research on inhibiting SARS-CoV2 viral entry by targeting spike glycans. The key point of the preprint is the interaction of lectins with spike proteins, which facilitates viral entry. The research uses dynamic light scattering to demonstrate that treatment with lectins rapidly aggregates spike proteins. The team used fluorescence binding assays to fit an isotherm to a 1:1 ratio, although the exact stoichiometry remains unknown. The figure they consider most important proposes that multivalent interactions are essential and that these interactions depend on glycans. Interestingly, they found that other Covid variants are also inhibited. Potential areas of confusion might arise from understanding the concept of multivalent interaction and the importance of stoichiometry in the interaction of spikes with the BOA lectin. The team emphasized that these interactions are not within spike proteins, but rather between BOA and multiple other spikes. The team is seeking feedback on additional experiments for future studies that could further explore their model. While animal models of infection may be the ultimate test, this is beyond the scope of this study for both effort and cost. The authors are looking for community feedback on how future  biophysical experiments can probe the nature of the multivalent interactions. Since the preprint was posted, some other lectins have been tested and shown to have an inhibitory effect. The team believes it might be valuable to look at other interactions in the future. They also want to explore more about the monovalent version that is not interacting in the same way. Dr. Guseman's experience with preprint feedback has been positive.

I interpret this as background signal as these mice do not express hPGRN (and the signal is not due to mPGRN due to similar concentrations in the GRN-KO mice). In Figure 2C, the authors show hPGRN levels in WT mice to be 0, while the +AAV mice express hPGRN ~2000 ng/mg. Why is there a different 'background' to this assay between the experiments for these two figures for WT mice? #2: In Figure 1e, the authors show that AAV(L):bPGRN treatment enhances brain hPGRN to ~7000 ng/mg in Grn KO mice. In Figure 2D, the authors show that AAV(L):bPGRN treatment enhances hPGRN in the brain to 20 ng/mg in DKO mice. Both analyzed 9 weeks post injection. Is it surprising that there are over two orders of magnitude in the difference of brain hPGRN enhancement between the Grn KO mice and the DKO mice? I do recognize that these mice were treated with AAV(L):bPGRN at different ages--for Fig 1, these mice were 4-5 months old, and for Fig 2, the mice were injected at 6 weeks of age. I don't see how that could contribute to such substantial differences in hPGRN concentrations. -- Thanks in advance for any clarification here - feel like I'm missing an important detail here that's leading to my confusion.",2023-07-18T18:41:45,disqus_rotilT0XE6,Zach Rosenthal,10.1101/2023.07.14.549089,Rescue of FTLD-associated TDP-43 pathology and neurodegeneration by peripheral AAV-mediated expression of brain-penetrant progranulin,"Marvin Reich, Matthew J.

Dr. Neel Shah and Anne van Vlimmeren's preprint, titled ""The pathogenic T42A mutation in SHP2 rewires interaction specificity and enhances signaling,"" focuses on the study of a phosphatase with a variety of disease-associated mutations. The mutation they most focused on is deep in the N-SH2 binding pocket, and while it was known to alter binding affinity, the researchers discovered that it also changes specificity. This mutation results in the loss of a hydrogen bond, but surprisingly, this enhances binding affinity. The mutation also confers a specificity change for many peptides. The researchers' favorite figure in the preprint is the one that tested different peptides and where they mutated lysine 55 to arginine, showing that the effects of this residue were coupled to residue 42. They are most excited to receive feedback on how the binding correlates to cell signaling and whether this correlates 1:1 with binding affinity. Long term, they are interested in how to further explore the broader cellular interactions of this mutant. They anticipate that some might find the three other mutants that impact binding affinity to a lesser extent confusing. The researchers are also curious to see if people are as compelled by the complementarity of their MD and biochemistry as they are, and what potential blind spots they might have missed. The researchers are strong advocates for preprints, seeing too many upsides to not use them.

The key point of their preprint is the untapped potential in cryoET datasets for understanding the spatial distribution of different complexes and conformations in the cell. They describe a different approach using machine learning methods, with the goal of putting things in a cellular context. The researchers faced challenges in exploring how portable their original cryoDRGN framework is to Electron Tomography (ET) data. While some elements worked well, such as the decoder network, encoding the raw data was difficult due to the shift from one particle being one image to having multiple images of a particle. Their favorite figure, Figure 6, demonstrates the potential of tomography to generate high-resolution, individualized pictures. They feel that this figure in particular highlights the promise of visualizing how a complex, such as the ribosome, may adopt different structures and interact with distinct cofactors depending on its subcellular localization. The researchers are excited about the possibility of discovering new biology through their paper and are eager to continue hearing feedback on use cases, particularly in cases where tomoDRGN has helped users uncover structural heterogeneity that helps them better understand how their complexes of interest work. They also expressed some concern about potential confusion regarding the generative model and the process of classification. Looking forward, they plan to explore the relative species of ribosomes and correlations between complexes. They also mentioned how many emerging ideas in the field are indicating paths to computational shortcuts for processing the tilt-image-series data directly without explicitly generating tomograms - success in this area could be a game-changer in the field.

I looked into the alignment simulation methods because I was particularly intereseted in how you simulated indels. The ""mimick"" method is very interesting. I haven't seen that before. It sounds like it could produce much more realistic alignments, and if so - I would highlight this method to bring it to the attention of our community. A problem with simulations based on some indel model is that they unrealistically use a fixed indel rate across the alignment. Natural protein sequences have large variation in indel rates. When I tested the effect of alignment errors on positive selection inference I saw that without indel rate variation there wasn't a significant effect, but when I introduced indel rate variation I saw a strong effect. I did that by simulating alignment blocks with different indel rates, which I inferred from empirical alignments of HIV protein sequences. Best, Eyal Privman Privman, E., Penn, O., & Pupko, T.

The manuscript’s hypothesis of an endonuclease “fingerprint” of a synthetic origin in the SARS2 genome makes a testable claim: if regions around the sites composing the “fingerprint” are sampled in nature, engineered nucleotides will stick out like a sore thumb. Authors were told about this test in the first week of September 2022 when people independently noted the recombinant evolutionary history and that almost all elements in the “fingerprint” are sampled in a handful of the most closely related genomes. Others rephrased essentially the same test, with Francois Balloux commenting to Alex Washburne on September 5, 2022: Assuming we wished to follow up on this, the next step would be to test if high homology can be found to different Sarbecoviruses for (some of) the 6 fragments defined by the restrictions site (ie. there's no reason to expect natural breakpoints to match restriction sites). This step was not taken. And it was not a difficult step. Shortly after the manuscript’s publication, Crits-Cristoph and colleagues rigorously showed that the hypothesis fails this test: https://github.com/alexcritschristoph/ancestral_reconstruction_endonucleases – the conclusion is noteworthy considering the public record, which demonstrates bias in site selection and post hoc selection of statistical tests. In fact, this manuscript’s hypothesis gained attention only after Justin Kinney, who is acknowledged for his assistance on the manuscripted, prompted the discussion by suggesting a different hypothesis about a different restriction endonuclease, BsaXI. In the comments section of V1 of this manuscript, Alex Washburne proposed a second test of his hypothesis, claiming that “the rapid loss of this pattern is indicative of its evolutionary instability, suggesting what we observe in the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral state is not a stable pattern resulting from recombination, but a transient, unstable pattern that perhaps went against selection and reverted back once the infectious clone was subjected to selection from considerable onward transmission.” While this statement makes some dubious claims and another test is not needed, this comment shows that Washburne considers fitness changes in mutations at these sites to be another test of his hypothesis. This is a test that Washburne can conduct based upon published analysis of the fitness impacts of mutations: https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS2-mut-fitness – as Washburne and co-authors have not published the results of this test, I will briefly do so here. The mean, median, maximum, and minimum fitness change estimated for point mutations in the “fingerprint” of the 5 BsmBI or BsaI sites in SARS2 are -1.7, -1.4, 2.2, and -6.5. The same calculations for 1000 random samples of 30 nucleotides give -1.7, -1.5, 1.8, and -6.4  (see link above on interpreting these numbers, or simply note their similarity). A search on https://cov-spectrum.org/ shows that point mutations or deletions for one or more of these 30 nucleotides have been reported in 0.75% of sequences sampled in the most recent 3 months. Point mutations or deletions for one or more of 30 random nucleotides (a single random sample; results will vary) have been reported in 0.96% of sequences in the same period. All in all, the main point of interest in these 30 nucleotides is the attention given a hypothesis of a “fingerprint” of synthetic origin that was effectively disproven before this manuscript was published. Finally, considering the countless number of equivalent hypotheses, I suggest that a better effort would be immune to these tests (and I can think of at least one example myself). It is critical that a manuscript of this type demonstrate that there is an unbiased rationale behind the hypotheses tested and that is plainly not the case here. One simply needs to observe that “longest fragment” is referred to 20 times in the manuscript, while “shortest fragment” goes unmentioned.",2023-07-14T23:30:00,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,10.1101/2022.10.18.512756,Endonuclease fingerprint indicates a synthetic origin of SARS-CoV-2,"Valentin Bruttel, Alex Washburne, Antonius VanDongen",2023-04-11

By solving the structure of ASNS and performing 3DVA, they suggest that a single side chain's dynamic motion (Arg142) regulates the interconversion between open and closed forms of an intramolecular tunnel. The opening of this tunnel allows for the translocation of ammonia, which is necessary for ASNS’s catalytic function. MD followed up on this initial finding to determine exactly how The study highlights the power of cryo-EM in identifying localized conformational changes and demonstrates how conformational dynamics can regulate the function of metabolic enzymes with multiple active sites. However, the lack of experimental electron density shown in the figures (or available publicly) makes it difficult to assess the claims in this study. Additional forward tests of the importance of this blockage via mutagenesis may also uncover why it must be regulated. If this is out of the scope of the current paper, it should be hypothesized and speculated upon in the discussion. Major Points: 1. 	In your figures, Please show electron density and all individual atomic positions. This includes Fig. 1d, 2a, and all of Figure 3. 2. 	Please show the PCA of the 3DVA. Clarify whether this was done on the entire structure or the tunneling residues. If done on the entire protein, please comment and show if other changes were seen elsewhere. 3. 	In the RMSD analysis, please clarify what EM coordinates you are using. Are you comparing all structures from the 3DVA? Please also provide raw values as well as normalized values. 4. 	Your results do not support the claim ‘Our results suggest that changes in the C-terminal active site are propagated over a distance of approximately 20 Å, leading to tunnel opening and ammonia translocation’. While the data here shows that the tunnel can move between an open and closed state in apo form as part of the native fluctuations (revealed by the PCA analysis). No information is presented on how this information is propagated nor how the active site or binding interacts with this motion. Please change the wording of this or explain the mechanism. Minor Points: 1. 	Neither the PDB nor the map is publicly available, making it difficult to examine the structures and map independently. Please release them. Also, include information and metrics regarding map sharpening and map-to-model fit. Zenodo is a good option for the 100 structures from the PCA analysis. 2. 	In Figure 1d, please label the amino acids and chains. Please provide experimental density corresponding to the positions of these residues in this figure or a supplementary figure. 3. 	In Figure 2a, please provide a legend for what each color represents. 4. 	How did you determine 5 PCAs for the 3DVA analysis? 5. 	Please provide details on the normalized RMSF. How was this normalization done? 6. 	In Figure 4, please provide a legend for all colors of amino acids and tunneling. 7.

This algorithm exemplifies the application of NLP methods in the context of biological data. The tool utilizes a Market Basket analysis to identify known co-occurring TFs based on the locations of their transcription factor binding sites, regardless of the data source. The authors have made modifications to the Market Basket approach to accommodate the specificities of the transcription factor regulation process. The enhanced model takes into account the multiple occurrences of the same TFBS within a defined window. Moreover, the algorithm considers the order and orientation of co-occurring TFs, which represents a significant improvement over previously published tools. Lastly, the tool performs a sophisticated analysis of identified TF pairs, which is visualized using various analytical tools, including differential and orientation analysis, calculation of TFBS distance to a transcription start site, and network reconstruction. The tool's performance was compared to existing tools and validated using open-source data. The authors made several modifications to the Market Basket approach; however, the descriptive connection between different parts of the algorithm is somewhat unclear at times. For instance, they mention overcoming the threshold issue of the cosine association score, which is a limitation of this method, by calculating the Z-score of significance. Initially, it seems like they calculate the Z-scores of cosine values. However, upon examining the script available on GitHub, it becomes evident that they actually calculate the Z-score of the distance between two TFs. The assessment of the normality of the distance distribution is also performed. Unfortunately, the publication does not emphasize this important aspect of the algorithm. Another noteworthy aspect is related to Figure 2.A. It is observed that the number of co-occurring pairs differs across cell types, which raises intriguing questions. Is this variation primarily influenced by biological factors or technical factors? Is this variation an expected outcome? Or does it correlate with the number of peaks present in the CHIP-seq data utilized for validation?",2023-07-06T13:37:54,liudmylakondratova,Liudmyla Kondratova,10.1101/2022.06.21.496953,TF-COMB - discovering grammar of transcription factor binding sites,"Mette Bentsen, Vanessa Heger, Hendrik Schultheis, Carsten Kuenne, Mario Looso",2022-06-22

These kinds of studies are essential and, now powered by single cell sequencing, can cast wide nets that enable unbiased description and investigation of this process. As clearly stated by the authors, the description provided here undoubtedly provides numerous follow-ups, questions, and hypotheses about regenerative success and failure. The authors should also be commended on creating a webtool to allow others’ to query their dataset. “Cross-species data integration was effective as both zebrafish and medaka cells were represented in each major cluster”. Agreed that across the major clusters there is good agreement. I’m more curious about if this is potentially overfitting–are you losing a different cluster only present in one species? From published data, could we expect any different clusters between these two species? (addressed a bit later on with zEP cells). In general, it may be worth exploring a couple other strategies for cross species integration to try and prove this further (point 6 also addresses this). The scale of the interferon-deficiency in the medaka is striking. It’s mentioned that DAMPs from necrotic cells could be a driver of interferon responses, but building on some of your prior work (Balla et al. 2020 PMID: 32413307), are the zebrafish all harboring some virus at this point and the medaka not? Could a viral/microbiome-related reason result in lack of IFN signaling. Relatedly, it would be interesting to see if medaka have type IV interferons ( https://www.nature.com/arti... (and if these are included in this one-to-one comparisons/ if they are even annotated in the current version of the zebrafish genome). Finally, is there evidence of any DAMP response? For example, are there still other chemokines and cytokines (potenitlaly NFkB nuclear translocation) being produced in medaka and just specifically not an IFN signature? This is getting at the question of whether this is specifically lack of IFN signaling or if medaka are hyporesponse to, for example, DAMPs. Is recruitment responsible for increased macrophages in zebrafish or is it expansion of tissue resident cells? This could affect the conclusion drawn in medaka that they are not recruiting macrophages. Figure 3H, the proportion of TNFa positive cells is reported, but what about the absolute number? Given the relatively higher numbers of macrophages in the zebrafish it would be interesting to see how these compare. The ratio of pro versus anti-inflammatory macrophages could be an interesting metric to report. Do the zebrafish ever mount a substantial pro-inflammatory response? It’s suggested that highly regenerative animals undergo a quick switch from pro- to anti-inflammatory and this is important for regeneration, but data demonstrating that is sparse at best and the question remains if there is ever robust a pro-inflammatory response in regenerative animals. Paragraph starting with “We know relatively little about the makeup..” is a bit unclear. What type of cells are you referring to? Are these the fibroblast-like cells or fibroblasts? The concluding sentence leads one to believe fibroblasts are benign studied, but earlier on it’s discussed that “epicardial cells cells expressing collagens”. Do you find collagen expression by macrophages? ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.... Are mmp15/16 implicated in regeneration? Regarding the zEP cells and their potential uniqueness to zebrafish, it would be interesting to explore a samap or other tools and see if they still remain separate ( https://github.com/atarasha..., https://www.biorxiv.org/con..., note: this paper integrates zebrafish heart single cell data with 4 other species and could be worth looking at). As noted by the authors, more work is needed here. Whole mount FISH of hearts from both zebrafish and medaka would be quite interesting to see if zEPs can be detected anywhere. The mammalian studies are interesting and could be worth expanding. It would be insightful to tie back into the first few figures and the major findings there. Can you learn anything new from the mouse dataset with the perspectives gleaned from the fish comparison? For example, what is happening with the ISGs in the mouse? It could also be interesting to compare to salamander heart regeneration to provide another evolutionary intermediate ( https://www.nature.com/arti... Do primordial cardiomyocytes wane with age? Do larval/developing medaka contain these cells and do these young medaka regenerate their hearts? (perhaps not experimentally feasible). What is the role for the compact myocardium when not in regeneration? Why is there so much diversity in its size across species? Do you think there is a unifying reason for lack of regeneration in medaka? You uncover quite a few differences. Minor stuff: This is a biased comment, but it would be really interesting to know if there is divergence between replicates. You could pull out each sample with some genotype-based demuxing. Check out: https://www.life-science-al.... This might also aid with DE analysis ( https://www.nature.com/arti... “To investigate the contributions of epicardial-derived cells to the fibrotic response, we re-clustered all cells expressing epicardial-specific markers tcf21 and tbx18, and re-clustered them into four…” a bit confusing with double re-clustering here. Do medaka lack cortical cardiomyocytes or are they just less abundant? The last line of the figure 6 results section suggests an absence with the use of “lack”. One could consider side-by-side violins might better illustrate between time point comparisons. Figure 6E and G with numbers for cluster labels is not super clear. Perhaps these could be labeled with the top markers they express or more info added to figure legend to explain. Including on the figure the species for E-F and G-H could also help orient readers more quickly.",2023-07-06T11:17:24,nick_leigh,Nick Leigh,10.1101/2023.07.04.547574,Distinct features of the regenerating heart uncovered through comparative single-cell profiling,"Clayton M.

However, this study provides more evidence for the existence of the polar filter. When there is reduced interaction between N828 and the phosphate moiety of the incoming nucleotide, the rNTP can move slightly such that the 2'-OH will no longer clash with the steric filter. If there is proper interaction between N828 and the phosphate moiety, then it is not possible for the rNTP to move to neutralize the steric filter. The Asn residue is conserved in other B-family DNA polymerases and all the available crystal structures show the presence of the interaction between the conserved Asn and the phosphate moiety. The  M644 residue is present below the triphosphate moiety. The observation that the M644G mutation leads to reduction in the interaction of N828 with the phosphate moiety of the incoming nucleotide is very interesting because the C-beta atoms of the two residues M644 and N828 are located about 9 Angstroms from each other.",2023-07-06T08:56:03,disqus_m8BBtWtL3O,Deepak Nair,10.1101/2023.07.01.547322,A sensor complements the steric gate when DNA polymerase ε discriminates ribonucleotides,"Vimal Parkash, Yashraj Kulkarni, Göran O.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.27.546055v1#comment-6220777788,biorxivstage,1,"I have some comments, however, on the phrasing of your definition of a cell type. The phrase I am concerned about is ""We propose that a cell type should be robust to inter-individual variation, and therefore defined as a group of cells that are more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain."" There is also a very similar variation to it in Fig. 6 that shares the same difficulties: ""Cell type is defined as a group of neurons which is more similar to a group in another brain than to anything in the same brain"" It is repeated with variations once more further in the text with the same problems: ""To address these complex typing issues we employ a new definition of cell type that uses inter-animal variability to determine when cell types should be split: A cell type is a group of neurons that is more similar to a group of neurons in another brain than to any other neuron in the same brain"" 1. It is also not clear if you are stating how ""cell type"", the idea, should be defined, or how different cell types should be delimited. Are you defining the concept of ""cell type""? Or are you suggesting a methodology for identifying cells of the same type in practice? A subtle, but very important distinction. 2. It is also important to notice that this is not a general definition of ""cell type"", as it is scoped to Drosophila melanogaster brain connectomes. This is obvious from context but needs to be explicit for it to be a precise definition. . A definition that says ""A cell type is a group of neurons"" excludes all non-neuronal cells and is incompatible with the use of ""cell type"" for all other non-neuronal cells. You would be more precise by saying ""A neuronal cell type is a group of neurons"". Also, not all neurons are in brains, so the definition also needs to make that clear. 3. Going pedantic at ""A group of cells that are more similar to cells in a different brain"" -- The beggining of the sentence seems to refer to ALL brains, and then it says that this group is more similar to cells in a DIFFERENT brain. These similar cells in the DIFFERENT brain are NOT part of the group? Are cell types restricted to single brains? Some rephrashings that  try and prevent that paradox, and could be what the authors mean, would be: ""A group of cells that are are more similar to each other, even among different individuals,  than they are to other cells in the same individual."" Or even: ""For any individual, each cell type is defined as a group of cells that are more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain."" 3. The definition needs a quantifiable similarity metric. In the case of the study, it seems to be based on patterns of connectivity and morphology. It does, however, brings up the question: what about other kinds of similarity? Are they less useful? In terms of genome content (e.g. SNPs), they will be always more similar to cells in the same individual. Does the existence of different cell types depend on the similarity metric used? Is this a contextualized, procedural definition? These should be clear, otherwise the definition is overstating and might bring up confusion. The algorithmic implementation you present is very data-dependent, as it considers it mandatory presence of the type in each of the 3 individual hemispheres 4. The looseness of the ""similarity"" ends up including cell states and other extraneous groups of cells. E.g. ""apoptotic cells"" are more similar to each other than to others, or ""cycling cells"" or even very artificial cell types such as ""big neurons"", whose size will be more similar to each other than cells in other brains. You implement a particular, and complex, system based on connectivity and morphology, but these details are not part of your definition. 5. You don't make it clear if the the definition is restricted to a species or is a larger definition of cell type across nature. The different brains you mention are only in Drosophila? Or a particular species of Drosophila? A particular strain? If just a strain contains a set of cells with a particular connectivipy pattern, but other strains don't, do you _really_ want to call it a cell type? To sum up, these notes intend on bringing up the subtleties in defining the concept of ""cell type"". To make it less ambiguous one possible phrasing would be: ""We propose that cell types should be robust to inter-individual variation. Cells of the same type should be more similar to each other then to other cells. For our Fly Brain Cell Atlas, each cell type corresponds to a set of Drosophila brain neurons that are, by connectivity, more similar to neurons in other individuals then to other cells in the same brain."" If you want to talk about the concept of cell type, using some formal ontology vocabulary,  you could say that: ""We define the concept of ""cell type"" as a group of cells for which any two cells share a similar connectivity and morphology, to a higher extent then to any other cell outside the group."" In this way, you include cells of different individuals under the same cell type umbrella, without ambiguity. Of course, then you need to define what you mean by a ""similar connectivity pattern"". It is very weird that you say that  ""A cell type is a falsifiable hypothesis about biological variability within and across animals34"", AND that you tested such hypothesis, because that is not what you do in your system. You have data-driven neuron types, with identifiable individuals across 3 datasets. Now they may form each a falsifiable hypothesis. Which hypothesis is that? How can one falsify it? That is unclear, and unless you specify it, unadressable. You mention that ""Crucially, this resource includes 4,179 cell types of which 3,166 consensus cell types are robustly defined by comparison with a second dataset, the “hemibrain” connectome3"" So, if your analysis FALSIFIED the hypothesis, you should not even mention the ~1000 cell types that were FALSIFIED. You are not using the hypothetico-deductive method, and the ""falsifiable hypothesis"" system is not fit for your work, as it is data-driven, iterative and induction-based (and not deduction-based), without random sampling and a low N. However, it is an excelent work! You just cannot say your resource is different becaus it treats cell types as  falsifiable hypothesis to be tested, and then not rejecting in the light of falsification. The work is, of course, solid science and adds much to the state of the art. The theoretical formulations are still not at the same quality of the analysis pipelines and experiments. I hope at least some of these comments will be useful, with the goal of refining definitions of cell type for increased precision and usefulness.
