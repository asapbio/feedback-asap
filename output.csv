I have following comments/questions: Major: - Definitely the current state of the research suffers from insufficient validation. Please, reproduce your analysis on (Thompson, 2018); (Meer, 2018) datasets as well as other single-cell hepatocytes datasets like (Gravina, 2016.) - It is not theoretically clear how the exponent in PC-1 component is related to the one in Gompertz law. Provide more theoretical explanation as one, for example, was proposed in (Vural, 2014, Phys. Rev.) - The exponential fit to PC1 scores seems to be unreliable because I expect a large confidence interval for this parameter due to the small number of data points. Please, add confidence interval for the parameter. - I also recommend to compare exponential fit with other model families like parabolic or sin or others. AIC criterion could be used here for model comparison. - ""Such a pattern of exponential growth in both mean and variance is indicative of stochastic instability of the organism state..."" - this is the key phrase I saw in multiple papers from your group. I assume using this statement you implicitly refer readers to the Wiener process property of increase variance linearly with time. But I do not know which well-known process has exponential increase in variance. Could you please elaborate this explanation more in the text by adding the necessary literature references? - In your previous paper (Aging clocks, entropy and limits of age reversal) you obtained linear relation for human blood PC1 scores, no relation for PC2 scores and hyperbolic relation for PC3. My question is why PC2 in humans shows no relation with respect to some function? - I also interested why you changed methodology of CpG-sites pre-selection by comparing with the previous work in humans? - ""The distribution of the loading vector components for the exponential feature, DNAm-PC1, displays heavy tails, indicating the presence of sites significantly associated with this process"" - is the order of PCA loadings stable? Did you test the CpG sites with boostrap procedure, by subsampling the dataset and checking the stability of PC-loadings? - In figure 4b you demonstrate that CR mice demonstrate higher PC2/tBA values than Control. But what if this observations is due to the covariate shift between two datasets which was caught by PC2 and not caught by PC1 axis? This could explain the differences by a pure data distortions without attracting more complex theory. - No code - No supplementary info Minor: - ""...as heavy regularization tends to select a number of features approximately equal to the sample size, based on their correlation to the target phenotype."" - could you please add a reference to this theoretical result. My experiences with complexity penalization says other. - In the regards of problems with clocks, adding remarks on biomarkers paradox, multicollinearity and uncertainty  problem would be beneficial.",2024-03-10T08:35:38,dmitriikriukov,Dmitrii Kriukov,,,,

My research is focused on studying the interaction between plants and bacteria. Our laboratory has activities that include reading articles related to the areas of knowledge we study, called “Preprint Club”. For this activity, I selected your preprint called “Culturable approach to rice-root associated bacteria in Burkina Faso: diversity, plant growth- promoting rhizobacteria properties and cross-comparison with metabarcoding data” for reading and evaluation. In your manuscript you carried out tests with isolated bacteria and this was very interesting, studies like yours are very important to clarify the processes involved in the plant microbiome. However, I would like to make some observations about your manuscript: In the introduction I thought you covered several topics, which are important to the topic, but are not specific to your research so they are not that relevant. On the other hand, how do you make a direct comparison of your results with the study referring to your bibliographic reference (60) (Barro, et al 2022) I thought I could address aspects of this study in its introduction. Regarding the captions, in general I would suggest that the authors write more details when describing the figures so that it would be better to understand the results. This is important for the reader. Specifically in the caption of figure 4, we note that there is no caption for some images (specifically figure 4d) Regarding the figures in general, I would also like to suggest that the authors increase the size of the details in the figures. Specifically in figure 8, where the species included in the heat map are so close together and because they are very small, it is not possible to read them and this hinders the understanding of their results. And finally, I would like to suggest more photos and data on the results of the in vivo tests of the two rice cultivars. These are some notes that I thought were important to write, I hope they are useful for the authors. It was a pleasure to read the preprint of your research.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.02.573835v1#comment-6407596278,biorxivstage,0,"Hi, great paper overall – very nice insight into the mechanistic and structural basis of PARIS defense. I am curious about your discrepancy with Rousset et al. (2022) regarding whether PARIS is a toxin-antitoxin system. They state, “We then focused on the system from E. coli B185 for subsequent experiments. Deletion of either ariA or ariB was non-toxic and abolished defense, excluding the hypothesis of a toxin-antitoxin system and showing that both components are required for activity (Figures S4C–S4E).” If ariB encodes a toxin, I expect they would have observed growth inhibition when deleting ariA. They don’t show the growth curves of these two mutants, only lawns with plaques in Figure S4. Additionally, Burman et al. (2024) state “As opposed to prototypical toxin-antitoxin systems, AriB isn’t toxic when expressed alone. This suggests that AriA activates AriB through a structural modification that enables dimerization or an unidentified posttranslational modification. More work will be necessary to determine the mechanism of AriB release and activation.” And “Expression of AriB alone is not toxic to the cells, nor does it provide phage defense [Rousset et al. (2022)]”. In your experiments, you only observe toxicity when overexpressing AriB, and not from the native promoter. Do you think this is an accurate representation of the natural/normal toxicity of AriB? Do you think these genes are transcriptionally regulated and only expressed at levels sufficient for toxicity during phage infection? Do you think the basal level of AriB expression from the native promoter is low enough to avoid the toxicity you observe during overexpression? Your results suggest that AriB toxicity doesn’t necessarily depend on “a structural modification that enables dimerization or an unidentified posttranslational modification” as posited by Burman et al. (2024). Do you think that when overexpressed at a high enough level a fraction of AriB can homodimerize without release from AriA by Ocr? You stated that “while we were initially unable to express and purify soluble AriB, we found that incubating AriA-AriB with Ocr released soluble AriB for further analysis (Figure 4c).” This made me wonder about the necessity of AriA+Ocr for AriB solubility and dimerization/activation. If you were to quantify the cellular/chromosomal abnormalities in the microscopy images presented in Figure 6 and Figure S15, do you think AriB overexpression would exhibit an intermediate phenotype to AriA and AriA+AriB+Ocr? It is hard to tell from the (single) images, but it looks like there is a higher proportion of dead (yellow) and abnormal cells in Figure S15C compared to S15A, perhaps suggesting increased AriB activity/toxicity when released from AriA by Ocr then when expressed on its own. It's nice that you have similar conclusions regarding the structure of the PARIS-Ocr complex as Burman et al. (2024). Additionally, their work supports your hypothesis of AriB blocking protein synthesis “potentially through cleavage of as-yet unidentified essential cellular tRNAs.” In short, what do you think underlies the discrepancy in AriB toxicity between your study, Rousset et al. (2022) and Burman et al. (2024)? Rousset, F., Depardieu, F., Miele, S., Dowding, J., Laval, A.L., Lieberman, E., Garry, D., Rocha, E.P., Bernheim, A. and Bikard, D. (2022).

""Scheduled"" caste comes from affirmative action by government of india which is based on British list. On the other hand, Other backward caste gained positive affirmation as a political alternative to Ram temple agitation. Both are collection of several castes. There are ""most"" backward caste MBC and so forth. I think ""Jati"" is the better way to go for genetic analysis. Several years ago, jati was involved with a specific profession and marriages took place inside those jati only. In my opinion it would be better if comparison was made between various Jati in different regions. Also, inside the same region among various jati. Also, It would be worthwhile to mention here that the regions marked north/central/east etc are based on political boundaries which came into existence in the 20th century, the main purpose of which was to exercise strict control over the population. It would not be appropriate to club entire 21st century political unit as a homogeneous one for genetic analysis.

This has compelled the need to understand mechanisms underlying ICB resistance so that effective therapy can be designed to overcome ICB resistance. In this direction, the pioneering work of Dr. Khleif’s lab showing the role of CD38+PD1+CD8 T cells in ICB resistance was a landmark contribution (Ref #17 of this communication). Using elegantly designed pre-clinical studies (with mouse TC-1 and melanoma tumor models) as well as clinical samples (melanoma patients; pre- and post-therapy) they convincingly established the role of CD38 (high)PD1+CD8 T cells in ICB. This submission by Or-Yam Revach et al., (Dr. Jenkin’s Lab at Harvard Medical School) reinforces the importance of CD38+PD1+CD8 T cells in ICB resistance with CD38 as a marker of exhaustion.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.29.547000v1#comment-6405063502,biorxivstage,1,"Dear authors and readers of this bioRxiv preprint, The approval of the anti-CD3 antibody by the FDA in November 2022 now enables a “disease modifying” therapy for the first time, which can delay the manifestation of T1DM by two to three years [1]. And in combination with an anti-TNFα antibody, such a therapy even opens up the prospect of a long-term therapeutic effect with curative potential in the foreseeable future. The successful implementation of such a therapy is based on numerous studies over the last decades, which have shown (not cited in this manuscript) that the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα plays a central role in the destruction of pancreatic beta cells in the pathogenesis of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) [2, 3]. The authors Alexandra Coomans de Brachène et al. of the current MS now present results that lead them to hypothesize that the interferons IFNα and especially IFNγ play a prominent role in the destruction of beta cells in T1DM. This is in contrast to the situation in the endocrine pancreas in vivo, both in patients with T1DM and in reliable spontaneous animal models of human T1DM [4]. The gene expression and protein expression of IFNγ is only low in infiltrated pancreatic islets of the human T1DM pancreas [4] and in the infiltrated pancreas of the IDDM rat model of T1DM, which is closest to the human situation [5], while the highly expressed TNFalpha is the pro-inflammatory cytokine that is centrally responsible for the destruction of pancreatic beta cells in the infiltrated T1DM pancreas [2]. Combination therapy with anti-TCR in rats (ie, anti-CD3 in mice and humans) and anti-TNFα eliminates the infiltration with proinflammatory cytokines [3, 6], which cannot be achieved with a combination therapy with anti-IFNγ [3]. An exclusive reference to an antidiabetic effect in the NOD mouse model of T1DM is inadequate, as the authors do in the current manuscript. A large number of studies in the NOD mouse showed therapeutic success in this mouse model using a wide variety of preventive therapies, but none of these therapies could be successfully transferred to the situation in patients with T1DM [7]. A successful transfer of such a therapeutic concept into an effective translational therapy for patients with T1DM, which enables a return to a normal metabolic state, is therefore not recognizable based on the facts presented, at least not in the foreseeable future. Therefore, IFNγ does not play a central role in the T1DM pathogenesis. Such a concept lacks the necessary experimental basis.

In the first differentially tagged Pwl2 and Bas1( presumably an effector known from previous work to localise to the BIC) expressed in the same strain is inoculated onto rice rice and Pwl2 and Bas1 are shown to co-localise, which demonstrates Pwl2 is secreted into the BIC. In the second experiment two different strains, one carrying Pwl2 marked with GFP and the other carrying Pwl2 marked with RFP are used to co-infect rice.The claim that a BIC contains either RFP or GFP and not both only becomes meaningful if you were to state here that you specifically scanned for individual cells at the infection site that were simultaneously infected by both strains.How many such cells were observed? In the legend of Fig 1the statement “ confirming that the BIC does not contain Pwl2 transferred from rice cells” occurs. This is very cryptic and no mention of this is idea made in the results section. Presumably the unstated hypothesis is that transfer between BICs in the same rice cell could occur. Although the data support this the hypothesis should be included in an expanded results section. Perhaps this experiment is not necessary in this paper?

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.01.549754v1#comment-6400442506,biorxivstage,2,"The origin of viruses: from hypothesis to fact Claudiu Bandea (February 26, 2024) The origin of viruses is one of the greatest mysteries remaining in biology. In previous comments regarding the recent discovery and characterization of Borgs [1, 2], I proposed that Borgs are incipient viral lineages that originated from symbiotic or parasitic archaeal lineages, as predicted by the fusion model of the origin of viruses, by reductive evolution from cellular ancestors [3-6] . The reduction hypothesis regarding the origin of viruses was proposed in the mid-1930’s [7], during a period when knowledge of the structural and biochemical composition of viruses and of the diversity of cellular organisms was still emerging. However, by the middle of the last century, this growing body of knowledge led to the formalization of the modern concept of viruses [8]. In 1957, Andre Lwoff, one of the founders of modern virology, defined viruses in his famous article “ The Concept of Virus ” as biological entities that: (i) have only one type of nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, (ii) multiply in the form of their genetic material, (iii) are unable to grow and to undergo binary fission, and (iv) lack energy metabolism [8]. The conceptual identification of viruses with virus particles, or virions - the transmissible, infectious forms in the viral life cycle - and the definition of viruses based on the physical, biochemical, and biological properties of these particles have both endured until recently in virtually all scientific literature and textbooks (discussed in [4, 9-16]). Not surprisingly, within the conceptual framework of viruses as virus particles, the historical hypotheses for the evolutionary origin of viruses focused on the structure and biochemical composition of virus particles: (i) the Pre-cellular or Virus-first Theory suggesting that viruses originated from precellular, self-replicating nucleic acids, or replicons, encoding for capsid proteins; (ii) the Endogenous or Escape Hypothesis proposing that viruses originated from cellular genomic sequences, or replicons, encoding for capsid proteins; (iii) and the historical Regression or Reduction Hypothesis proposing the reductive transition of parasitic cellular lineages, such as bacteria, into nucleocapsid-like structures. In context of the view of viruses as particles, the reduction hypothesis was questioned by Salvador Luria and James Darnell, the authors of one of the first textbooks of Virology [17], who wrote: “ The strongest argument against the regressive origin of viruses from cellular parasites is the non-cellular organization of viruses. The viral capsids are morphogenetically analogous to cellular organelles made up of protein subunits, such as bacterial flagella, actin filaments, and the like, and not to cellular membranes. ” (all quotes in italics) [17]. Two decades later, in concert with a new perspective on the nature of viruses and a new definition based on their properties during the intracellular stage of the viral life cycle, I proposed a fusion hypothesis for the origin of viruses [3-5]. Briefly, according to the fusion hypothesis, viral lineages originated from cellular organisms that fused with their host cells through a process in which their cell membrane fused with the host membrane. By discarding their cell membranes, these novel organisms increased their access to resources present in their special environmental niche, the host cell, including the ribosomes and translation machinery. After synthesizing their specific molecules and replicating their genome using the resources found in the host cell, the parasites produced spore-like, transmissible forms, which started a new life cycle by fusing with other host cells. These incipient viral lineages diversified by reductive evolution into a myriad of viruses with smaller genomes and diverse life cycles. The origin and evolution of viruses ‘ molecular organisms,’ overcomes the problems presented by the historical reduction theory. Nonetheless, unlike the new perspective on the nature of viruses, which, after decades in obscurity, is increasingly used to explain the biology of viruses and their role in shaping the metabolism and the evolution of their hosts [9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18-27], the fusion model for the origin of incipient viral lineages has received little attention. Possibly, the main reason is the reminiscent scientific argument put forward by Luria and Darnell against the reduction theory, which has been recently re-articulated by Mart Krupovic, Valerian Dolja, and Eugene Koonin in their article “ Origin of viruses: primordial replicators recruiting capsids from hosts ” [28]. They write: “ Thus, the evolution of giant viruses, irrespective of the numerous interesting and puzzling aspects of their genome layout and biology, can be accommodated in the evolutionary scenario proposed here. Also, no evidence exists for the possible origin of viruses from intracellular parasitic bacteria. As intracellular parasitic or symbiotic bacteria have evolved numerous times and have independently given rise to extremely reduced forms, including organelles (119,120), the absence of bacteria-derived viruses suggests that the evolutionary path from a cell to a virus is impracticable. ” Patrick Forterre and Mart Krupovic emphasized the same problem with the historical reduction hypothesis: “ virions were so different from any kind of cell (even the most reduced parasitic cells) that the regression hypothesis (the idea that parasitism triggered the reductive evolution from cells to viruses) was discarded as senseless by most biologists (for an exception, see Bandea 1983). ” [16]. Indeed, many symbiotic intracellular bacterial lineages evolved by regressive evolution into organelles, and several parasitic bacteria have reduced the number of their genes and proteins to a fraction of those found in their ancestors, or for that matter to a fraction of those found in some viruses. Yet, these organelles do not resemble virus particles. Nevertheless, like in the case of Luria and Darnell’s argument, the rationale used by these authors for questioning the historical reduction theory does not apply to the fusion hypothesis. Another scientifically sound rationale for dismissing the historical reduction hypothesis emerged from phylogenetic studies refuting the hypothesis that giant viruses originated from a fourth domain of cellular life by reductive evolution [29-31]. These studies support an evolutionary relationship of giant viruses with smaller viruses, which is consistent with the theory that they are polyphyletic and did not originate from a fourth domain. These results, however, are also consistent with the fusion hypothesis, which supports the evolutionary relationship of giant viruses with smaller viruses and contradicts the fourth domain hypothesis. Indeed, one of the fundamental predictions of the fusion hypothesis is that new giant virus lineages originated from diverse parasitic pre-cellular and cellular lineages throughout the history of life. Another prediction of the fusion hypothesis is that only cellular lineages that parasitize evolutionarily related hosts from the same cellular domain can transition to a viral type of biological organization. This explains the apparent homology of some of their genes with those of their hosts, which has been usually interpreted as evidence for the accretion model for the evolution of viruses towards complexity. As mentioned above, the current phylogenetic analyses do not exclude the reductive evolutionary diversification of the giant viruses into smaller viruses. Indeed, as recently noted by Natalya Yutin, Yuri Wolf, and Eugene Koonin: “ The only alternative, however non-parsimonious, to the massive gene gain scenario appears to be independent early emergence of multiple ancestral giant viruses followed by massive losses in the branches leading to the smaller extant viruses. ” [29]. This alternative is exactly what the fusion hypothesis predicts, with the realization that this process has occurred throughout the history of life, which explains the extraordinary diversity of the extant viruses, including thousands of relatively small viruses. It is difficult to envision how these small viruses have evolutionary survived for several billions years since their presumed origin, as postulated in the accretion model [28]. Interestingly, at the other end of the accretion model, we could envision the possibility that some complex viral lineages transition into cellular lineages. That would be, indeed, an extraordinary event, but I’m not aware of any evidence suggesting such a transition. However, as discussed in the following, given the general evolutionary trend of symbiotic and parasitic organisms, the accretion model is questionable. I find the logic of viral evolution, as recently articulate by Koonin, Dolja and Krupovic, to be the cornerstone for our thinking about the origin and evolution of viruses: “ Overall, the logic of virus evolution is defined by the key biological feature of viruses, namely their obligate intracellular parasitism. ” [32]. I also find this logic of evolution to be applicable to thousands of parasitic cellular lineages from all cellular domains. In this context, unlike the virus-first hypothesis and the escape hypothesis, or their hybrid formulations, which are based on the principle of viral evolution towards complexity, and which dominate the current scientific literature, the fusion hypothesis is consistent with the well-documented reductive evolution of thousands of intracellular parasitic microorganisms. This prompts the critical question: Why would viruses evolve in the opposite way? Nevertheless, the holy grail of the fusion model is that it can be addressed experimentally. Even better, because this model predicts that new incipient viruses originated from parasitic cellular lineages throughout the history of life, it is possible that this natural evolutionary process can be observed in real time. Hypothetically, Borgs are incipient viral lineages that originated relatively recently, through a fusion mechanism, from archaeal ancestors evolutionarily related to their hosts [1, 2]. More extraordinary though, as I previously discussed [2, 4] some extant parasitic cellular lineages, such as parasitic red algae, are currently at various stages in their evolutionary transition into viral lineages. Do the current data and observations regarding the biology and life cycle of parasitic red algae support a scientific transition of the fusion hypothesis into an established fact? The fusion of these parasites with their hosts cells is surely a fact. The use of host cell resources, including, in my assessment, the host cell translation machinery and ribosomes, to synthesize their specific proteins and other components is also a fact. Another fact is that after replicating their genome using host-cell resources, these parasites direct the morphogenesis of their reproductive, spore-like, transmissible forms, which initiate a new life cycle. So, are some parasitic red algae viruses, and has the fusion hypothesis transitioned into a fact? References: 1.

The question of whether the iPRC is equally valid empirically for excitatory and inhibitory inputs is a valid question that is being studied by us. This study focuses on the assumption that because the inputs are small (in the experiments we use 20 pA amplitude sinusoids) then we can assume linearity, and that's what we do. The important point and the assumption of our study is that distinct GPe neurons receive a shared oscillatory input. Based on our (yours and mine) 2004 J Neurosci paper that is a good assumption, as we found that the local field potential (which is thought to represent the synaptic inputs), is highly synchronous between neurons, especially in the parkinsonian state, when it is indeed oscillatory. So regardless of what is the source of the oscillatory input in parkinsonism (STN, striatum or both), we ask given that it's there, is the cell-autonomous heterogeneity of GPe neurons sufficient to explain the large phase delays in the cross-correlograms. Using the empirical heterogeneity of GPe iPRCs, we show that such large phase delays can be generated, without needing to invoke additional network influences (other than the common oscillatory input). I hope that helps and answers your question.",2024-02-25T03:26:02,joshgoldberglab,joshgoldberglab,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.17.567578v1#comment-6396779299,biorxivstage,0,"Summary: Fusidic acid (FA) and its derivative fusidic acid cyclopentane (FA-CP) are antibiotics administered to treat Staphylococcus aureus (SA) infections. Previous studies have established that FA acts by impeding release of elongation factor G (EF-G) from the ribosome, thereby inhibiting translation. However, because previous structures of FA bound to ribosome have been solved from Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to FA, our understanding of precisely how FA acts on Gram-positive species like Staphylococcus aureus and how resistance arises is incomplete. In this paper, the authors solve cryo-EM structures of FA- and FA-CP bound ribosomes from Staphylococcus aureus to understand their interactions with the ribosome in a native Gram-positive environment and put previously observed resistance mutants in context.The major success of this paper is its development of a structural rationale for previously observed FA-resistant mutants, and development of a structural basis for improved FA derivatives. Additionally, the authors found novel posttranscriptional modifications within the SA ribosome. The major weakness of this paper is in validation of these novel rRNA modifications. In conjunction with FA-bound Gram-negative ribosomes, these structures are important for defining the core interactions that mediate FA resistance, which could also help to enumerate the space of possible future resistant mutants. Major points: Given the high level of sequence conservation in ribosomes across different bacterial species, it would be informative to explain the benefits of investigating ribosomes specifically from S. aureus. Are the FA binding site and EF-G in S. aureus distinct from the FA binding site and EF-G in bacteria used in previous structural studies of FA-bound ribosomes? Or is there something unique about S. aureus physiology and its development of antibiotic resistance? Providing a specific explanation, perhaps by citing what previous studies in the field have not captured or providing sequence conservation metrics, would emphasize the novelty of these structures and how they contribute to our understanding of FA resistance. “The CHI state is the most abundant in our sample, and only a minor population is in POST state. In the FA data, 60% of the ribosomes are bound to EF-G, and 93% of those are in CHI state. In the FA-CP data, 72% of the 70S particles contain EF-G, out of which 88% are in CHI state.” Would an S. aureus ribosome dataset with EF-G bound but no FA in the sample have no detectable POST population? A comparison to EF-G bound with no FA in the sample would also strengthen the claim “In our data, however, we do observe POST state, indicating that FA inhibition allows time for the SSU head to back-swivel in presence of EF-G.” Before making claims about how FA changes the landscape of EF-G bound-ribosome conformations, it would be helpful for readers to understand the initial landscape of EF-G bound-ribosome with no FA – perhaps explaining observations from previous studies would help with this. In Figure 4, any differences in hydrogen bonding or other FA interactions between the three different structures should be highlighted (or lack thereof should be mentioned). Although the text describes different rotamers and positions of switch II and residues like R464, it is unclear to us how that impacts FA binding interactions. In Figure 5, the explanation of resistance mutations would be clearer if there were a side-by-side diagram of what interactions are present in a FA-susceptible ribosome vs FA-resistant mutant, as opposed to simply highlighting all the affected residues. As is, Figure 5 is unclear about whether multiple mutations are required to confer resistance or if each residue individually confers resistance, and the relative increase in resistance that each mutation confers. Discussion of how these mutations rationalize previously observed resistance on a structural level, and whether this structure can also rationalize the degree to which they confer resistance, would be helpful. Furthermore, we are curious how the FA-CP analog corresponds to these mutations – does the structure rationalize FA-CP resistant mutants as well? An additional figure in the style of Figure 5 but with FA-CP, showing FA-CP resistant mutants from previous studies, would further show how this structure can provide a basis for understanding resistance mutants. For the rRNA modifications observed in Figure 6: We are curious whether these modifications could be related to EF-G, fusidic acid, fusidic acid cyclopentane interactions and relevant resistance mutations. Speculation in the discussion about possible consequences of these modifications, resistance-related or not, would be helpful for readers to understand why these modifications are important. The authors showed the single modifications in Figure 6, but perhaps a few supplemental figures showing how the modifications interact with functionally important parts (i.e. decoding center and peptidyl transferase center) of the ribosome would be helpful for reader comprehension. Since FA-CP was tested against S. aureus ATCC 29213 in Garcia Chavez et. al. 2021 (reference #28), but the ribosomes in this paper are from S. aureus NCTC 8325-4, we are also curious if these rRNA modifications are general to all S. aureus ribosomes or if there is some strain-specific modification. The authors made their conclusions about novelty based on their map in comparison to E. coli rRNA modifications. These modifications could also be compared to other S. aureus ribosomal structures instead of the E. coli structures. Additionally, for further investigation of the cryoEM density itself, there are programs such as qPTxM or Curiosity (both of which can be found at https://github.com/irisdyoung) that could help validate that the modification is present and clarify any heterogeneity in the density. Validation by mass spectrometry or other experimental techniques would also increase confidence in the model. Minor points: In Figure S4, it would be helpful to show the hydrogen bonds or other interactions that lock switch II in place. Regarding this sentence, “ The other is an intermediate so-called chimeric hybrid state (CHI) of translocation, in which the head of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) remains swiveled and tRNAs make A- and P-site interactions with the mRNA codon and the SSU head, but P- and E-site interactions with the 30S body and the 50S (12, 18).” It was not clear as to what the authors meant after the word but.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.19.572389v1#comment-6396738752,biorxivstage,1,"In a previous paper, the authors expressed fragments of peptides to identify sequences that would act as “dominant negative” inhibitors of the parent protein. However, screening peptides for inhibitory effects in cells by bulk competition and deep sequencing has limitations. Due to their limited size, peptides can potentially have multiple non-specific or off-target consequences such as multiple target binding, cytotoxicity, or non-specific binding to the target protein of interest. Validating that a peptide is a true inhibitor is critical, however, determining the mechanism of inhibition across multiple fragment sequences can be very time consuming. Genetically this could be done testing fragments in overexpressed target protein backgrounds to help confirm that the interaction between a given fragment and the desired target is due to target inhibition but, for libraries of fragments, a more high throughput method would be desirable.  While in some cases (such as with GroEL and GroES) the authors inferred that the inhibitory effect of fragments were specific interactions due to the concentration of the target protein (i.e. correlation between higher expression of target and inhibition), the mechanisms of inhibition for several proteins were not definitively proven to occur through native interactions which leaves an open question as to whether these fragments are true inhibitors. Here they develop a computational screen to increase the confidence that inhibitory peptides work via the desired on-target mechanism, the authors have now developed a computational tool that is built upon AlphaFold called FragFold. FragFold structurally predicts the fragment bound to the target protein, with inhibitory fragments identified experimentally having a predicted high number of contacts between fragment and target. The major strength of this paper is in developing a method that could be used to identify regions of proteins that are involved in PPI’s based on evolutionarily related sequences that recapitulate the native binding interfaces. The major weakness of this paper is that the underlying method of MSA concatenation is not clearly explained (see Major point 1). Why is the discontinuous unpaired strategy optimal relative to other AlphaFold-multimer-like strategies? Overall, the paper demonstrates the power of AlphaFold to closely recapitulate the structures of experimentally determined fragment binding interfaces by working exclusively in sequence space in a high-throughput manner. Further, in the absence of experimental structures, the authors present plausible AlphaFold predictions of fragment bound structures that are supported by biochemical and genetic data which could further contribute to the utility of this method in studying known PPI’s. There are a few points we would like to bring to the attention of the authors to strengthen the manuscript further. Major points: 1) The authors state that they generated multiple sequence alignments for both the fragments and target protein prior to running AlphaFold2 to minimize computation time. Although it is not clearly explained, the authors claim they concatenated these two MSA’s into a single MSA. We interpret this to mean that the input MSA’s were not directly pairing the fragment sequences to the target sequences but leaving either side of the fragment sequence and the target sequence blank to force AlphaFold to co-predict the structure of the fragment with the target protein by treating it as a single discontinuous sequence. While we were surprised by the simplicity of this method and the ability to remain in sequence space based on evolutionary similarity of fragment and target protein sequences, there are several questions we have regarding this implementation. From the explanation provided with figure 1A, the fragment sequence appears to be directly paired to the target sequence, however in fig 1B the method appears to work by using the evolutionary information of many orthologs and related proteins of both fragment and target to co-predict their structures using a discontinuous input sequence. Is this correct? Could the authors provide a clearer description of how they are concatenating the MSA’s? We were also curious to know how different concatenation strategies affect the accuracy of predictions. For example, could the authors also try concatenating directly paired fragment-target sequences from the same species of origin (or even try this as a single continuous sequence)? If the sequences are continuous, does adding linker regions between the fragment and target alter the results? Does the order of concatenation affect the results (concatenating from the N or C-termini of the target?). 2) In Figure 2A, the peaks indicating inhibitory activity correlate positively with the observed peaks in calculated weighted N_contacts, which forms the basis for all inferences. However, the data reveals an interesting observation in the initial segment of the protein fragment (0 to 100 aa) that while there is a peak indicating predicted binding by the AlphaFold model, there is no corresponding inhibitory activity observed for the protein in that region. Any comments on this discrepancy? 3) The authors introduce (f_native,pairwise) and (f_native,binding) to quantify similarities between experimentally solved structures and AlphaFold2 models. We found the explanation of these metrics to be confusing, one refers to the fragment and the target site but the other refers to the native binding site bound by the fragment. Is one referring to the contacts made in the experimental structure and the other the contacts in the AlphaFold model? Further clarification of what these precisely correspond to would be helpful for discerning the similarities and differences between the two. 4) In both figures 2 and 3 the authors show structures of the experimentally solved complexes and the predicted AlphaFold models side by side. We were curious to know whether the AlphaFold models were able to recapitulate the sidechain conformations. In addition we were also curious to know whether the AlphaFold model recapitulated any key contacts made between the binding site and the fragment (ex: salt bridges, electrostatic interactions between charged amino acids, pi-pi stacks, hydrogen bonds between sidechains). 5) The authors explain their use of tiling to generate inhibitory fragments and that overlapping fragments generate greater predicted binding peaks. Have the authors attempted to use smaller fragments in their program (i.e. what is the smallest fragment size that AlphaFold can still predict to be correctly binding?). We are curious to know if effects vary by changing the fragment sizes. Further, can this method be expanded upon to study multiple different fragments that bind to different sites on the target protein simultaneously? Minor points: 1) The orange and yellow lines used to show contacts between the fragment and target are difficult to distinguish from each other. Consider a different set of colors? 2) Figure 4C+E. The use of black in the model makes it difficult to distinguish the sidechains and interactions with the fragment. - Reviewed by CJ San Felipe, Priyanka Bajaj and James Fraser (UCSF)",2024-02-21T19:14:22,,Priyanka Bajaj,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.24.577062v1#comment-6395818896,biorxivstage,1,"(The comments below are my own thoughts and aren’t meant to serve as a substitute for peer review) This manuscript presents a much-needed quantitative examination of structures of LeuT fold transporters, which are helical membrane proteins that import and export a wide variety of substrates in and out of cells. In the context of protein dynamics, this superfamily is characterized by a diverse range of conformational changes amongst its members, with some helices staying fixed in some representatives but not others throughout their respective transport cycles. In this analysis, the authors break down these conformational changes between pairs of structures using a rotationally- and translationally-invariant method for tracking helical movements (distance difference matrices, or DDMs). From these movements, the authors conclude that bundle-hash rocking is the foundation defining all conformational changes in proteins in this superfamily. The results are compelling, but my enthusiasm is somewhat dampened by the use of a comparatively small dataset and relative absence of mathematical rigor. I think this can easily be addressed with a bit of additional analysis. The basis for the main finding, stated above, derives from a principal component analysis (PCA) of these DDMs. If my understanding is correct, the authors use distance differences in 22 pairs of structures across nine proteins and arrive at six distinct motions that can explain most of these changes. While the authors show the reconstruction error when different numbers of principal components (PCs) are used in Fig 3D, I did not see a mathematical justification for selecting six components specifically. It might help to compute a statistical criteria such as the Akaike or Bayesian Information Criterion to verify that six PCs is the appropriate number. By the same token, it would be beneficial to run some cross-validation on some intentionally left out structural pairs. A low reconstruction error on proteins left out during parametrization would go some way toward supporting the authors’ conclusion that these movements are shared. For example, can the conformational dynamics of NSSs like SERT and LeuT be explained entirely using PCs derived from structures in other families? Finally, I would strongly encourage the authors to expand their analysis to include new structures deposited after mid-2021. I understand that this would add a lot of work, as I suspect that segmentation and assignment of residues to helices is done manually. But given the rapid clip at which these LeuT-fold structures are being deposited in recent years, it could significantly increase the size of the dataset. Off the top of my head, this would add NKCC1, KimA, and SGLT2, and probably others. Beyond that, a few things here and there stood out: •	It isn’t clear based on Fig 3F or the text if the PCA itself is segmented by specific steps in the conformational cycle, or if the structural pairs are unlabeled during analysis (I suspect the latter from the text). •	On the use of pymol cealign to align pairs of structures, it is a little strange given that this is a sequence-independent method intended to align proteins with little to no sequence homology. However, given the low RMSD between their pairs of structures, and that the paper’s bulk focuses on alignment-independent analysis, this is unlikely to affect the conclusions much at all (I've also tested it on a few pairs and the results look more or less identical to other sequence- and structure-based alignment methods). With that in mind though, I wouldn't state RMSD values in the text if they were calculated this way, unless they are supplemented by other metrics, such as TM-score •	The name MntH is used throughout the text, except at the very end where the name DraNramp is used. I assume these are the same protein? •	I just want to say that including an analysis where the membrane serves as a reference plane for a structural analysis is a great idea and very much appreciated, and I hope others follow your example and do the same thing",2024-02-20T16:27:03,diegodelalamo,Diego del Alamo,,,,

The authors did a great service to the field by highlighting that MES has the potential to compete with gas fermentations! Congratulations! In case my quick comment from earlier gets published, I apologize for the partial double post. However, after reading the paper more carefully, I wanted to amend the post and add the following: 1)	One concern regards the presentation and perception of the data, which could provide an unjust hurdle for others in the field when publishing their MES improvements. While nothing is stated wrongly, the abstract already implies a >200-day production of carboxylic acids at an unprecedented rate, efficiency, and current density. However, the stated maximum values are derived from what seems to be single measurements (CP) or a series of two values (CA) in a time series and represent spikes in productivity. Thus, other studies that might achieve improved average KPIs, e.g., stable production rates between the average rate and the peak rate achieved in this study (which seem to differ by a factor of about two; ~20 kg/m3 vs. ~40 kg/m3 butyrate in Fig. S4A, for example), could be regarded as not improving the field, because the production rates presented in the abstract and highlighted in the main text give the impression that higher rates have been achieved already during long-term operation. This leads me to a quantification question: How confident are the authors regarding the accuracy of the values of individual measurements? The data is significantly scattered, which could be due to a scatter in the sampling and quantification methods or due to biological fluctuations. While it is certainly possible that the microbial system performs exceptionally well for a few days only to subsequently crash and almost halt production for the next few days, a high scatter in the quantification methods (i.e., high measurement or sampling uncertainty) could result in a similar data profile. Unfortunately, the temporal resolution of the data is not high enough to clearly show biological fluctuation (with the potential exception of the 2-4 point peak in Figure 4D). Without clear evidence that the exceptional production rates and increases in product concentration are indeed caused by true biological fluctuations, highlighting these occasional values throughout the manuscript seems misleading. Even if these production rates are the result of biological fluctuations, a more detailed discussion of the highly fluctuating performance and its impact might be warranted. If dense biofilms are prone to cause these enormous fluctuations that would open an exciting and important field of research for biofilm-based MES. Nevertheless, the described system seems unable to continuously produce the exceptional amounts of product frequently highlighted in the manuscript. Therefore, reporting averaged production rates (over at least 3-5 measurements) together with peak values in sections like Abstract, Summaries, Conclusions, and Highlights (which are most likely to be posted most visibly and therefore picked up by data mining and AI nowadays used to gather data) would be a more honest representation of the results and seems more appropriate to me. The rates and other performance indicators are extraordinary enough, even without the focus on a few exceptional values. 2)	Furthermore, a comparison to “state of the art” MES systems and the statement that “biofilm-based MES have so far outperformed MES driven by microorganisms in suspension by several orders of magnitude” should be backed by values cited from the appropriate sources. The rates and other KPIs for studies cited in the paragraph starting line 59 are not mentioned to allow verification of the order of magnitude statement. Further, I would like to add that we recently also achieved integrated electrosynthesis of acetate with suspended cells at 40-95% CE and at rates that approach glucose-fed chemostats at high acetate titers, which is in the order of the “state of the art” KPIs cited later in the paper ( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.b... and supplements). A direct comparison to a variety of studies in multiple KPIs instead of hand-picking pair-wise comparisons would help to paint a more holistic picture of the improvements this study adds to the field. 3)	The microbial biomass reported is very high. Even to a degree that almost sounds impossible. Do the authors report wet weight or dry weight? I assumed dry weight because the cited reference states “Consequently, assuming νN,X = 0.2 molN molX−1 as coefficient of nitrogen in the elemental formula of dry biomass, (Popovic, 2019) the total amount of biomass in the reactor was obtained… “. 390 g/L dry weight would exceed the dry mass density of the cytoplasm of E. coli ( https://doi.org/10.1371/jou.... Further, water content is essential within biofilms and has been determined for several pure cultures and mixed biofilms and usually ranges from 70-98% (e.g., https://doi.org/10.1080/104..., whereas the maximum water content at 390 g/L cell mass would be less than 65% and exclude larger flow channels. Further, the cathode volume presumably also includes the carbon felt (assumed density 0.1g/cm3 with a carbon density of 2g/cm3 = ~5% of the cathode volume). Thus, less than 60% of the cathode compartment volume would be water. To push 2 cm/s of fluid through such a dense biofilm seems almost impossible to me! Could you provide a little more detail into how this incredible biomass density was calculated and whether this density is comparable to other biofilm systems? Further, do you assume EPS is in the biofilm, and would this contain N as well? Could ammonia pass the Cation Exchange membrane and be lost? Could ammonia (or other volatile N-compounds) be stripped in the bubble column and impact the biomass quantification in a long-term experiment? 4)	Why focus the comparison to other non-MES systems on syngas fermentation? H2/CO2 gas fermentation would be more similar to the MES process. For Example, Kantzow and colleagues produced 148g/L/d acetate or (>2.4 gc L-1 h-1) from H2/CO2 in a continuous system with suspended cells (10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.07.020). Further, Figure 5 B is likely not the best visualization of the comparison to other studies, because the points of all comparison studies cannot be distinguished on the [X] axis.

You're right that we basically infer this and don't have direct evidence in the case of TOPORS, which is why in the manuscript we're careful to only say that TOPORS promotes the polyUb. SUMOylation and the proteasome have both been shown to be necessary for DNMT1-DPC degradation previously (see nice work from Niels Mailand's and Julian Stingele's labs), but loss of RNF4 - the STUbL described up until now - did not prevent all of the degradation. The additional effect of further depleting TOPORS on degradation, coupled with the proteasome-dependence of the degradation, is what makes us infer that TOPORS' Ub ligase activity is at work here. I will say we're currently addressing reviewers' comments and will hopefully be able to shed more light on this. It's looking promising experimentally on several fronts, but in our hands the DNMT1-DPC polyubiquitylation is tricky to see nicely, which we think suggests that it's degraded quite quickly by the proteasome. Hope this helps!",2024-02-15T21:29:47,,Chris Carnie,,,,

""the false premise that SARS-CoV-1 evolution in humans during the early to late phases was monophyletic"" Is that really the premise? Couldn't multiple probing infections from a polyphletic animal reservoir, possibly with animal>human>animal transmission chains, also serve as a premise? They state: They ""this series of adaptations between species and in humans"" - a series of adaptations between species seems is distinct from ""in humans"". You seem to be coming away from the work with a different premise than the authors had The key premise that I see is that the SARS virus had changed a lot between when it first started infecting humans, and when it started infecting humans well. We seem to be missing the early probing infections of SARS-CoV-2. Perhaps they were just missed because they were less severe? ""In this regard the civet viruses SZ3 and SZ16 found at the Dongmen Market (3) are not the actual progenitors of ""Outbreak 1"" as depicted in Figure 5 of the preprint. "" That does not seem to be what figure 5 depicts at all. ""However, Pekar and colleagues (21) provide strong evidence that there were at least two introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into humans. Two lineages designated A and B emerged via the wildlife trade in Wuhan"" We strongly disagree on the strenght of this evidence, and it is improper to present their conclusion as an established fact. Lastly, I think both you and the authors are a bit too lose with the term ""genetic diversity"", when it often seems ""genetic divergence"" or dispartiy/distnace is what is really being discussed",2024-02-15T15:02:06,erikboehm,NMN,,,,

I would like to get clarification on something on this paper if possible. Lines 325-327 state that the data shows SUMO-dependent ubiquitylation (of DNMT1-DNA adducts) is promoted by RNF4 and TOPORS. Perhaps I missed it, but I could not see direct evidence for ubiquitylation in the data figures. I had interpreted that the authors were inferring ubiquitylation from the effects of TOPORS/RNF4 KO on DNMT1-DNA adducts and the known roles of these enzymes. Would appreciate if the authors or anyone else could help clarify this. Thanks GN",2024-02-13T04:16:02,,GN,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.26.577324v1#comment-6387103857,biorxivstage,2,"It is good to see that an organoid model of the AKT1 c.49G>A p.Glu17Lys variant has been created. It may turn out to be useful for studying Proteus syndrome. Unfortunately, the preprint by He et al includes a number of errors and misconceptions about Proteus syndrome, previously published results, and general concepts about therapeutic research. It is odd that they expected to find the Proteus syndrome variant in a lymphoblast cell line (Coriell GM12209) as it has been shown that no living patient with Proteus syndrome has the variant detectable in a peripheral blood sample (PMID 21793738). In that publication, only two of 38 blood samples were positive and both of those were from deceased patients and could not be replicated. As stated in GeneReviews “It is strongly recommended to not use peripheral blood for molecular genetic testing in individuals with suspected PS.” The authors refer to our work (PMID 31194862) when they state: “Chimera animal models9 with germline transmission of the conditional AKT1 allele recapitulate the clinical manifestations of PS syndrome in the skin, bones, and vasculature…” It makes no sense to refer to chimeras and germline transmission. As well, these animals did not have an abnormal skeletal phenotype, nor did they have significant skin manifestations. The statement “Animal models are also unsuitable for identifying patient-specific treatment responses due to variations across species.” is perplexing. Animal models are widely used to model therapeutic effects. It is unclear what is meant by “patient-specific”. They claim their model is “consistent with the vascular malformation systematically seen in Proteus syndrome patients”. Indeed, there are no manifestations of the disorder seen “systematically”. The disorder is mosaic and thus not all patients have any particular manifestation. It makes no sense to refer to a “50% mosaic mutation”. The correct term to use here would be ‘variant allele fraction’. In a constitutional heterozygous genotype, VAF is 50%. If 50% of cells harbor a heterozygous variant, the VAF is 25%. It is nonsensical to say that a given mutation level is “mirroring clinical observations”. Since every patient has a different level of VAF and that level varies across tissues, it is not clear that this claim has any meaning. It is not correct that miransertib “…has shown efficacy in reducing facial bone overgrowth and the size of cerebriform connective tissue nevi in PS patients after one year of treatment, although a survey of 41 patients indicated no significant improvement in overall clinical outcomes as per the Clinical Gestalt Assessment (CGA) for PS10” (10 is the citation for PMID 35461279). In fact, that publication included no data on treatment. The authors seem to have misinterpreted our publication on vascular abnormalities in mouse models of Proteus syndrome (PMID 33030203). While the AKT1 activating variant caused an abnormal honeycomb-shaped capillary network with increased density of endothelial tubes, the key conclusion of that paper is that this variant caused a defect in the vascular remodeling of the capillary network, preventing the formation of the higher ordered vascular branching network. The He et al paper should discuss a technical limitation of their vascular organoid method in analyzing vascular remodeling in vitro. It is surprising that the methods section of the publication does not include any information on the sourcing of the therapeutics used in the study. It is important to include this in the methods as there are numerous sources of therapeutic compounds that are of dubious quality.",2024-02-09T13:32:31,christopherours,Christopher Ours,,,,
