(1) Unfortunately JunctionSeq is not available in the current Bioconductor release (it appears to not be actively supported), so it would be difficult for me to implement any options to adapt it into the SpliceWiz pipeline (due to compatibility issues, etc). Nevertheless, as I understand, JunctionSeq utilises both exon and junction reads which is a different philosophy than that of SpliceWiz which only uses junctions (except in IR). One issue with STAR's SJ.out.tab is that when read pairs overlap a region that contains a splice junction, that junction is counted twice! In SpliceWiz, read pairs are treated as fragments and so coverage is not double-counted. This is also another feature in our coverage plots: unlike IGV, coverage from overlapping read pairs are not counted twice. Conceptually, read-pairs arise from the same RNA molecule, so the coverage and junction counts should not be counted twice. I'm not familiar with QoRTs and whether or not it suffers from the same issue. SpliceWiz treats included and excluded reads as separate matrices, and GLM-based contrasts in DESeq and limma wrappers evaluate the interaction between these matrices and the contrasting variable as their readouts. A helpful explanation of this approach by the DESeq2 author can be found here: http://rstudio-pubs-static.... In the end, users would choose a tool based on a number of factors - ease of use, ease of experimental validation of the detected signals, ease of user understanding of how the data is wrangled. SpliceWiz offers a simplistic view of splicing using the traditional concept of it being a binary event (e.g. skipped vs included cassette exons, etc), which is (hopefully) easy to understand for researchers. This may well be at the expense of detecting complex (more-than-one-step) splicing events which is one limitation. (2) Although our group's prior contribution (IRFinder) assesses""all"" introns as putative IR events (a good assumption at the time as IR was relatively unknown back then), SpliceWiz makes the distinction of annotated vs unannotated IR in that annotated IR means a transcript from the GTF contains an exon that fully overlaps an intron in another transcript. This is useful for the purposes of benchmarking using simulators like flux-simulator, where our input is transcript_id and TPM values (meaning it can't simulate IR events if the IR-transcript is not already annotated). We discovered our annotation approach discovered 3x more annotated IR events than rMATS and SUPPA2, and Figure S4 essentially explains why. We don't believe these extra annotated events affects false positive rates (I agree it would be useful to formally test this!). The reason is the general principle of assessing ASEs as""local"" events - which is based on the assumption the event occurs independently of other ASEs outside the locus. Whether the other end(s) of the exons of the IR event is differentially spliced should not be relevant to the IR at the intron of interest.

Regarding polygenes, they cite a 1992 paper of Naveira (2), rather than his 1998 summary of work carried out with Maside (3). They appreciate my drawing this to their attention and have suggested that readers of their preprint paper would appreciate a formal comment. At issue is whether, when genomically dispersed, the term “polygenes” should be interpreted as “many genes,” or something else. Pondering why incompatibility factors are so dispersed they write (1): “One of our key findings is that many factors of perhaps individually small effects are widely dispersed across autosomes or on the Z chromosome. Consequently, average chromosomal ancestry is often more informative of phenotypes than any particular locus. This pattern is similar to the polygenic threshold model of hybrid incompatibility in Drosophila, where abnormal phenotypes depend more on the total quantity of introgression than where introgression occurs in the genome [41, 42, 43].” Their first reference here “[41]” is to Naveira’s 1992 report on polygenic effects causing sterility in male fruit fly hybrids. However, they do not mention his subsequent detailed studies with Maside that were summarized in 1998 (3). These concluded that, rather than genes per se, “it might be only a question of foreign DNA amount.” Thus, “experiments on the nature of these polygenes suggest that the coding potential of their DNA may be irrelevant.” The Naviera-Maside hypothesis was cited in a 2000 paper on Haldane's rule (4), but it has been largely overlooked in the literature. There appears to be no discussion of the hypothesis in the paper of Xiong et al. (1), even though the case for it has grown appreciably (5). It is also important in view of their paper's opening remarks on ""the sex with the greatest fitness costs."" Fitness usually implies genes. However, sterility and fitness do not necessarily go together. A mule is sterile but very fit. So being ""fit"" is subtle and it may be unwise to imply that a sterile organism is necessarily unfit, especially when that sterility is considered ""largely phenomenological."" Thus, it is good that Xiong et al. write of ""incompatability factors"" rather than of ""incompatability genes"" (1), which implies phenotypes.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.17.508207v1#comment-6029387269,biorxivstage,0,"I have some concerns about the attribution of many of the gene alterations that were proposed to have resulted from RNA editing. When the changes were evaluated in our tumor samples it appears that multiple changes resulted from incorrect mapping of the sequence reads. For example, the PHF2 variants, which occurred at the first 2 bases of intron 16, corresponded to the first 2 bases of exon 17. These are visible in IGV when soft clipping is turned off, and the first 5 bases that were proposed to be intronic also matched the first 5 bases of exon 17, which is indicative of the problem of mapping RNA-seq reads properly. This was not true of all of the changes, as the G>A changes in NEIL1 mapped to exonic sequences, but we also have transcriptome data from matched normal tissue samples from 1 of our patients where expression of these variants was observed. This is another issue that has not to my knowledge been adequately addressed, as normal tissues express ADAR, indicating that these changes may not be tumor-specific. Finally, there is the issue of the high error rate of reverse transcription, which may not occur equally at all sites. This is a problem that is not easy to resolve, unless these changes are directly probed, which would seem like a good way of potentially validating these changes.",2022-11-02T18:28:17,disqus_1ruehpT9ca,Paul Robbins,10.1101/2022.09.17.508207,Proteogenomic analysis reveals RNA as an important source for tumor-agnostic neoantigen identification correlating with T-cell infiltration,"Celina Tretter, Niklas de Andrade Krätzig, Matteo Pecoraro, Sebastian Lange, Philipp Seifert, Clara von Frankenberg, Johannes Untch, Florian S Dreyer, Eva Bräunlein, Mathias Wilhelm, Daniel P Zolg, Thomas Engleitner, Sebastian Uhrig, Melanie Boxberg, Katja Steiger, Julia Slotta-Huspenina, Sebastian Ochsenreither, Nikolas von Bubnoff, Sebastian Bauer, Melanie Boerries, Philipp J Jost, Kristina Schenck, Iska Dresing, Florian Bassermann, Helmut Friess, Daniel Reim, Konrad Grützmann, Katrin Pfütze, Barbara Klink, Evelin Schrock, Bernhard Haller, Bernhard Kuster, Matthias Mann, Wilko Weichert, Stefan Fröhling, Roland Rad, Michael Hiltensperger, Angela M Krackhardt",2022-09-18

Rajpar et al. bioRxiv 2022 doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.05.... We reviewed this preprint as a part of Arcadia Science's preprint review initiative. Collated comments follow: In this preprint, Rajpar et al. identify a novel role for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in mechanical load-induced bone accrual. The authors conditionally deleted TLR4 from Ocn-Cre-expressing cells (which primarily target mature osteoblasts and osteocytes). Ocn-conditional TLR4 deletion had negligible effect on baseline bone phenotype, but abrogated the effects of ulnar loading on periosteal and endosteal bone formation in both male and female mice. Prior papers from the lab demonstrated that nerve growth factor (NGF) expression by periosteal cells is upregulated by loading. Here, they show that periosteal NGF expression in loaded bones is reduced by the NF-kB inhibitor, BAY 11-7082, and that loading increases the number of TLR4+ periosteal cells in WT mice. Complementary in vitro experiments in MC3T3 cells and primary osteoblasts, showed that both NFkB and TLR4 inhibition abrogated the increase in NGF expression induced by in vitro mechanical stimulation (by fluid shear stress). Finally, the authors use bulk RNA seq to compare the transcriptomic profiles of loaded or non-loaded limbs in TLR4 knockouts and wildtype mice. Overall, these new data are exciting and implicate a novel role for a classic inflammatory signaling cascade in bone mechanoadaptation. However, we found that the structure of the paper, written with NGF as the starting point, is challenging to follow for naïve readers unfamiliar with the prior NGF studies and obscures the key finding (viz., TLR4). The authors could adapt the flow described above to make it an easier read and to emphasize the novelty and impact. Several experiments in the paper feature insufficient sample size or missing data, whose addition would improve the strength of the conclusions that can be made. Specific comments: 1.	Immunostaining in Fig 1 shows NGF:eGFP expression in the periosteum. This is qualitative; it would be better to quantify the number of eGFP+ cells and show this as a percentage of the total number of cells in the region of interest, for both loaded and non-loaded bones. While built on prior results, display and quantification of both loaded and non-loaded bones is important to demonstration the extent to which the BAY inhibitor reduces NGF expression to non-loaded baseline levels. 2.	The qPCR data in Fig 1 C-F are not adequately powered. A minimum of 3 mice per treatment group must be analyzed for statistical analysis. 3.	It is not clear how the ∆∆Ct values in Fig. 1 C-F are normalized. This information appears to be missing. 4.	An explanation of the kinetics of NGF and TRL4 analysis would help. NGF-EGFP expression is analyzed 3 hours post loading and TLR4 positivity is analyzed at 7 days. 5.	Figure 2 is presented as relative values, and non-loaded images are not shown. It took us a while to understand this figure. It would be clearer and more rigorous to show all four groups – Non-loaded WT, Loaded WT, Non-loaded cKO and loaded cKO on the same graph, along with corresponding representative images. These data are included in table 2, but tables are always harder to interpret compared to the main figure. Statistical comparison using repeated measures ANOVA would preserve matching and account for animal-animal variability. 6.	Scale bars are missing on the images in Fig 2. 7.	Figure 3 provides important support for the TLR4-NGF connection, especially with TAK-242 inhibition. The use of two orthogonal NFkB inhibitors to show the same effect is robust. Adding figure labels or illustrations to clarify the cell types used in each panel will add clarity. 8.	The timeline is missing from Fig 3A. 9.	The sample size for experiments in Fig 3 is unclear. Showing individual data points for independent samples, including for controls, is important. 10.	Addition of a diagram/illustration to Figure 3 to indicate the fluid shear stress conditions would add clarity. “Load” should be changed to FSS (Fluid Shear Stress) in this figure. 11.	The RNA-seq analysis in Figures 4, 5, 6 is unclear and does not show the comparisons most relevant to the study. We recommend re-analysis using the following comparisons: A.	Effect of load: Loaded WT vs Non-loaded WT. Which pathways are regulated by loading? B.	Effect of TLR4-cKO on pathways identified in (A) as load-induced pathways: Loaded WT vs Loaded cKO. Are the same pathways that were up/down due to loading still up/down after the KO? C.	NGF-signaling: the in vitro data show NGF expression is abrogated by TLR4 inhibition. But in the RNA-seq data, NGF remains significantly upregulated by loading in cKO mice. Whether this upregulation in the knockouts is due to the heterogeneity of the lysed cells in the tissue or is actually relatively lower than the upregulation of NGF by loading in WT mice is not shown. Comparison of the effect of loading on NGF induction in WT and cKO mice could answer this. If NGF signaling is reduced in cKO mice, compared to WT, RNA-seq would be the ideal method to look for signatures of altered signaling downstream of NGF.

Although tobacco smoking is a prevalent problem, not much research dives into how it affects human physiology on a cellular level. I appreciate your efforts to explore this topic on a deeper level. The title of the paper and objectives of the study stated in the paper claim to explore the effects of cigarette smoke on neurodegeneration and reactive oxygen species, however, there is a less definite link between these topics and inflammatory markers. These topics are not fully explored in this paper. More specifically, reactive oxygen species are not explored to the depths in which EVs were explored, yet it was stated in the paper, “cigarette smoke induces a series of mechanisms that activate cell populations from both the innate and the adaptive immunity, which in turn promote the secretion of multiple inflammation-related molecules such as proinflammatory cytokines including chemokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and extracellular vesicles...” Reactive oxygen species were not explored sufficiently to claim that cigarette smoke can activate ROS. The lack of exploration of key topics mentioned in the beginning of the paper, make the overall study over-promising in combination with a lack of data to back up the paper’s claims. For future studies, it would be helpful to see how ROS is affected in EV-secreting cells post smoking a cigarette to have a better understanding of cigarette smoke on ROS. The data that is available in this paper seems to be more descriptive than quantitative and has difficulty showing significance to claims that are being made. There is also a lack of controls in your data which make the existing data and claims unreliable. Perhaps in Figure 1 and 2, it would have been helpful to take blood from the smokers after smoking to compare the data and ensure what you are seeing is significant. In addition some of the claims that are in this paper are very generalized. It is important to understand how different demographics are impacted by cigarette smoke physiologically. Might I suggest, for a future direction, conducting more testing data to see if there are any statistically significant differences in physiological response for individuals of different  demographics. (For example, age, BMI, gender, ethnicity/cultural background, diabetic/non diabetic, etc. Once again, thank you for posting this paper.

Through examples they show that the distribution of points in this representation correlates with resolution and data collection temperature of the structures. They also construct the RoPE space of a protein using time-resolved experiment datasets and show that minor changes in the linear coordinate space are clearly observed in the RoPE space. This work demonstrates the utility of a non-linear representation of the conformational space in visualizing changes throughout the structure which are originally considered subtle. This work is very interesting and can have significant impact on ensemble studies on protein structures and in crystallization/cryo-EM and fragment screening efforts by showing the impact of temperature and resolution. The manuscript is very concise (perhaps too concise?) and well written. Major points: 1. In Page 3, para 2, the author states differences associated with data collection temperature is preserved across space groups for trypsin and lysozyme but Figure 1(a) and 1(b) marks different space groups only for lysozyme and not for trypsin 2.The section on carboxymyoglobin has some unclear statements: (a) “The RoPE space of these structures showed that, over the first three picoseconds, two torsion angle modes are sufficient to represent a clear trajectory during release of carbon monoxide”. Fig 1(e) does show a trajectory from -0.1ps to 3.0 ps but it is not clear how two torsion modes are sufficient to build the trajectory. (b)“The last three timepoints, 10 ps, 50 ps and 150 ps, are therefore beyond the biologically relevant timescales for CO dissociation in myoglobin and in-line with this, they did not strongly correlate with any other timepoints in RoPE space”. We are confused about which figure/data supports this non-correlation. Is it to be interpreted from Fig 1(e)? If yes, then the author should describe what is correlation and non-correlation in the context of this figure. (c) The section on “mapping motion back onto structure” in the methods makes it unclear why the scaling is normalized to 1degree and how that might bias the magnitude of motion observed in Figure 2a (+/- 0.3 A) 3. We tried running some analysis on the RoPE website but it was either unclear how to go about submitting a job or the website became unresponsive after clicking on “view conformational space”. The author can provide a run-through of the website usage with some examples. 4. It is unclear how important the vagabond refinement performed here is in the clustering. How would figure 1a, b look, for example, if the PDB or PDB-REDO models were subjected to ROPE without further refinement? 5. At the end of the SVD, it should be possible to project the contributions for each SV back onto the torsion angles most responsible for the differences. It would be interesting to plot that for BPTI and lysozyme to identify the torsions/areas leading to the greatest differences across temperatures. Minor points: 1. There are some gray colored points in Figure 1(a) and 1(b) which are not accompanied by a legend and their significance not explained. 2. To highlight the advantage of RoPE space, the author can show clustering of the same protein chains when clustered based on RMSD. The crowding of points when using RMSD vs. the separation of points when using torsion angles can make the utility of RoPE space obvious to the reader. - Ashraya Ravikumar and James Fraser, UCSF",2022-10-31T05:04:22,,Ashraya Ravikumar,10.1101/2022.08.04.502807,Torsion angles to map and visualize the conformational space of a protein,Helen Mary Ginn,2022-08-05

Walsh et al used CRISPR genome editing to tag the endogenous LOV-1 protein at both the N-terminus (mScarlet) and C-terminus (mNeonGreen). Figure 1 clearly shows that the N and C tagged fragments have different localisation patterns. The N and C terminal tagged fragments also displayed different transport dynamics (Figure 4). When a point mutation that is predicted to prevent cleavage (C2181S) was introduced in the mScarlet::LOV-1::mNeonGreen strain the localisation of LOV-1 was severely disrupted. Interestingly the the N-termini of LOV-1 was enriched in the cilia of three ray neurons suggesting that some cleavage can still occur in this mutant. Taken together this body of work presents strong evidence that LOV-1 is processed in C. elegans. The mScarlet::LOV-1::mNeonGreen strain will be a very useful tool for use in future studies to model conserved ciliopathy variants. I would predict that missense variants in the N or C terminal fragment do not affect the function of the other. Modelling these variants will help to elucidate disease mechanisms. One concern I have is whether or not the double tagged LOV-1 protein is fully functional. I can see in Figure 3D/F that the mating efficiency with unc-52 and the response behaviour is not significantly different from wild-type. However, I do not see the comparison to wild-type in the dpy-17 mating efficiency assay (Figure 3E). I would have appreciated a supplemental figure when the double tagged LOV-1 allele is first introduced to immediately address whether or not it is functional.",2022-10-29T08:23:12,KarenL_PhD,Karen Lange,10.1101/2022.09.07.504996,Tracking N- and C-termini of C. elegans polycystin-1 reveals their distinct targeting requirements and functions in cilia and extracellular vesicles,"Jonathon D.

One alternative interpretation is that the apoplastic conditions are different between these species, and therefore these SCPSs mutants/fragments may behave differently depending on the species.

This is demonstrated using T-DNA knockout lines, complementation, and CoIP. The authors show that SCPSs-like effectors from fungi other than S. sclerotiorum, oomycete and bacterial pathogens are also recognized by RLP30. In addition, they also show that SCPSs is recognized by different plant species. Based on sequence similarity to VmE02, the authors identify that the N. benthamiana receptor RE02 (also known as NbCSPR) can also recognize SCPSs. The authors then go on to delineate the recognized peptide from SCPSs, showing there is variation between plant species in the ability to recognize fragments derived from SCPSs. Finally, the authors show that RLP30 can also recognize an unknown elicitor found in small molecule fractions from Pseudomads, unlike the NbRE02. We enjoyed reading this well-written paper!

I think that this article was incredibly effective in proving the points hypothesized in the introduction and abstract. All of the information in the article tied back to information first brought up in the introduction, which helped me as the reader follow along and see the significance of the information being provided. I also appreciate how clearly the thesis statement is addressed in the introduction of the paper. The main idea of the paper is that physicochemical factors largely contribute to the phylogeny of aquatic bacteria. This is proven by the methods mentioned in the thesis, which is a phylogenetic and MAGs analysis. Although the purpose of this paper was briefly mentioned in the introduction as relating to climate change and understanding how changing environmental conditions might affect bacteria, the authors could have been a bit more explicit about how these findings affect this field of study. I would rate the significance of this paper as a modest contribution, because although the authors did tie its importance to climate change, more context regarding its place in the field would allow me to have a better understanding of its significance. The findings are important for understanding how climate change affects ecosystems and the organisms such as bacteria living within them, but again, more context would help in understanding the gravity of these findings. The methodology in this paper is convincing, and the only area I find questionable is the validity of MAGs in acting as an accurate representation of bacterial genomes.

It was very educational and understandable, even with limited knowledge of the field of Trypanosomes and parasitology. The contribution of the paper to really delve into the immunogenic capabilities of antigen variability of Trypanosoma is really providing a different perspective as to how it undergoes immune evasion. This detail really aided in surmising the paper's focal target of Trypanosoma responding to cells within extravasuclar spaces and their respective capabiltiies of changing their VSGs in such an environmental niche to best suit their survival as a whole. I was a bit curious of whether the tissue-dependency of this organism could be affected by different tissue types and extravascular conditions? For instance, would meningital tissue and extravascular spaces in the cranium feature a different response than enteroid tissue in the gut, and extravascular spaces there? The writing overall was very thorough and really helped to build my understanding. I feel one important and arbitrary takeaway from this work could be the clinical capability of recognizing this antigenic shifting, and maybe finding a means to classify the pattern of shifts to determine an effective means of possibly quantifying and curing sleeping sickness.",2022-10-25T04:04:37,disqus_dGRP4WIZyb,Pooja Ravi,10.1101/2022.06.27.497797,Extravascular spaces are reservoirs of antigenic diversity in Trypanosoma brucei infection,"Alexander Beaver, Nathan P.

Not only did confirm a lot of speculations that were proposed in prior studies, but it also highlighted a lot of new information about an aquatic environment (ie. brackish biomes) that has not previously been elucidated. It is intriguing that the transitions of bacterial communities both into and out of brackish bodies have glossed over in the field despite such type of environments taking up such a large portion of global waters. Some strong points of the paper that I noticed was that I liked how for the most part the figures in the paper were properly explained in the written portion and that the conclusions drawn were easily traced back to the data in the figures. It made going through the findings of the study a pretty straightforward process. In addition, I liked how you acknowledged the missing information from this experiment in your discussion section, such as exactly why transitions were more frequent into than out of brackish biomes. These kinds of acknowledgements paves the way for future research to build off of this study and come up with answers to these gaps in knowledge. In the end, you mention that ""phylogenomic analyses should be supplemented with experimental and ecological approaches"" in future studies, but what exactly did you have in mind?

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.27.497797v1#comment-6021551985,biorxivstage,0,"Summarize the (at most) 3 key main ideas. The three key ideas I gathered from this paper were – 1.	Extravascular spaces appear as an important and previously overlooked niche for antigenic variation in T. brucei infection. 2.	Extravascular-resident T. Brucei play a profound role in the longevity and persistence of T. brucei infection by exhibiting novel immune evading VSGs. 3.	Extravascular spaces potentially facilitate antigenic variation by providing parasites extra ‘time’ to reside in the same. Main contribution of the paper This paper highlights the role of the extravascular spaces in enhancing and or prolonging T. Brucei infection. This is a novel finding because previous work on T. Brucei has barely studied antigenic variation in extravascular spaces. Most studies have been conducted on blood resident T. Brucei. Claims that state that T. brucei populations residing in the blood fully represent the antigenic complexity of T. brucei populations have been falsely passed on. Consequently, this paper helps break such false beliefs. Besides breaking false beliefs, the importance of this paper is further highlighted in the introduction section which states that most T. Brucei parasites reside in the extravascular spaces during T. Brucei infection. By providing a rationale over why they do so, this paper helps guide effective strategies to eliminate T. Brucei infection. Now for example, researchers are more likely to focus on preventing the entry of these parasites into the extravascular spaces since it is these spaces which provide the parasites their key pathogenic mechanism and or strategy. Critique One of the claims researchers make to explain how extravascular spaces help enhance and or prolong T. Brucei infection involves the immune system. The researchers specifically claim that extravascular spaces provide the parasites additional time to carry out antigenic variation. While the researchers have provided an immunological basis for this hypothesis of theirs (by including the IgM antibody), I do feel that it still too far-fetched. It could be the extensive VSGs found in the extravascular spaces provide parasites additional time to carry out more antigenic variation rather than the extravascular space itself providing the parasites additional time to carry out antigenic variation (through blocking IgM). To solidify their IgM hypothesis, perhaps they can block the IgM antibody of mice and then infect them. This way the additional time earlier enjoyed by only the extravascular residing parasites can also be enjoyed by the blood resident parasites. If blood-resident parasites in this condition just like the tissue-resident parasites start to demonstrate higher antigenic variation, then this can provide support for the researcher’s claim that the tissue’s provision of extra time is what makes the parasites undergo more extensive antigenic variation within the extravascular spaces. It is important to note that the researchers in this study made use of a specific model of T. Brucei. They used T. brucei EATRO1125 AnTat1.1E 90-13 parasites which are incapable of developing into their short stumpy forms (McDonald et al., 2018). This appears risky since the short stumpy forms of the parasite enable it to undergo apoptosis and cell death. Hence it could be that the parasites continued existence in the tissue could be due to their inability to undergo apoptosis rather than the VSG itself. This definitely poses challenges on the main contribution of the paper which associates prolonged T. Brucei infection to VSGs and antigenic diversity.   Hence while using this cell line helps researchers account for antigenic variations which are independent of development, it also likely causes continued parasite pertinence due to the inability of the same to undergo apoptosis. Surface proteins like VSGs which serve as key players in host-pathogen interactions are often subjected to strong selection pressures resulting in rapid evolutionary changes through mutation, recombination, and gene duplication. Consequently, studying VSGs repertoires is very challenging and I wonder how the researchers ensure the initial stability of VSGs for comparison post antigenic variations. Significance While I do think that the finding is novel and hence significant, I believe that the researchers can do a better job in explaining the applicability of this finding in the field of vector biology. There also exist some issues (model of the parasite used) which may make one skeptical about the paper’s main contribution and hence significance. Methodology I believe that the experiments were well-designed. This is because they made use of appropriate and highly accurate reagents and techniques. For instance, after obtaining the tissues from mice who had been infected with T. Brucei infection, the tissues were treated with TRIzolTM LS to obtain RNA. Usage of TRIzolTM has long been considered the “gold standard” for RNA purification. The all-in-one reagent can lyse extremely complex samples, is easily scalable, generates and or recovers ample RNA yield and is also effective in inactivating RNAses. This way the researchers ensure that they preserve the RNA quality, integrity, and quantity. To get rid of any contaminating DNA researchers also make use of DNases This prevents their sample from being contaminated and hence ensures the integrity of their data (and therefore claims). Additionally, the researchers also make use of the Mag-Bind Total Pure NGS which refers to a reliable solution used for the purification of both DNA and RNA for next-generation sequencing workflows. The technique enables the researchers to selectively bind fragments thereby providing the flexibility of left, right or double-sided size selection. The purified RNA generated post this technique is suitable for a variety of downstream applications such as NGS library preparation, microarrays, automated fluorescent sequencing. Knowing that the researchers use such a reliable technique to purify and select their RNA gives me confidence over some of their results such as the one presented in the abstract – the expressed VSG repertoire is not uniform across populations of parasites within the same infection. Following extraction of the RNA from the extravascular tissue post T. brucei infection, the researchers then obtain cDNA from the RNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase and a primer that binds to the conserved VSG 14-mer in the 3’UTR. Using the enzyme Superscript III reverse transcriptase to carry out the reverse transcription definitely serves to be advantageous. This appears to be an effective strategy since the particular enzyme has been modified to have a higher half-life, higher thermal stability, and reduced RNase H activity. Furthermore, using primers that specifically bind to the VSG gene enable, the researchers to obtain cDNAs of VSG. cDNA’s reflect expressed genes and obtaining the same for VSG hence helps provide researchers an idea of the extent of VSG expression. Post obtaining the cDNA the researchers then subject the same to 25 rounds of PCR using VSG-specific primers that contain a Phusion polymerase. Use of such a polymerase definitely serves advantageous since, the polymerase brings together a novel Pyrococcus-like enzyme with a processivity enhancing domain. This enables the generation of PCR products with accuracy and high speed which is something previously unattainable with single enzymes. This further adds to my believability of the results since the reagents chosen to appear to be high quality and error aversive. Once the PCR products are obtained, they are then quantified using QuBit HS DNA kit which is a kit that enables accurate and precise quantification of dsDNA. The resulting DNA which represents VSG genes present in extravascular tissue post infection with the parasite, are sequenced using Illumina sequencing which is a high-throughput sequencing technique. Consequently, through using high-throughput, modern and accurate techniques, the researchers definitely make their data appear accurate. Using these techniques also helps the researcher’s study both the genetic and epigenetic bases of antigenic variation. Antigenic variations often occur by altering the DNA sequence of an antigen encoding gene or the regulatory elements. The changes then cause alterations in the expression levels of the antigen.  Since the researchers in this study not only sequence the VSG specific genes but also obtain and quantify the cDNA extracted from the RNA of TRIzolTM incubated extravascular tissue, this method enables them to assess both and account for both the genetic and expression level changes that associate with the genetic basis of antigenic variations. In fact, this method even enables the researchers to account for the epigenetic variations of antigenic variations. During epigenetic variations, antigenic variations manifest as changes in their expression levels as opposed to changes in their genes. Hence even if sequencing data shows no changes which may lead to the assumption of no antigenic variation, coupling this method with cDNA acquisition and quantification, definitely enables researchers to account for the epigenetic basis of antigenic expression by providing the researchers a chance to study changes in expression levels (Cortés & Deitsch, 2017). According to (Stockdale et al., 2008), three key things are required for antigenic variation. The first requirement includes the need for a family of genes encoding antigenically distinct surface antigens. T. brucei contains more than 1000 VSG genes. Through having access to those genes using VSG-specific primers, PCR, and sequencing and that too of extravascular tissues post the parasite’s infection, this technique enables researchers to assess antigenic variations in extravascular tissue. Another requirement for demonstrating antigenic variation includes the need for a single pathogen to express one variant antigen gene at a time. This prevents the over exhaustion of the surface antigens repertoire. Through extracting and quantifying cDNA which represent genes which have been expressed post extravascular T. brucei parasitic infection, the researchers can assess the same as well. The third and final strategy needed to achieve antigenic variation includes a mechanism which enables the microbe to switch the single expressed antigen gene. T. brucei appears unique in that it actually acquires two mechanisms to achieve those switching. The first mechanism involves a single antigen gene being expressed and then being periodically silenced with another gene being activated. This can be assessed by the chosen method since it makes use of cDNA analysis. The second strategy used relies on recombination. Specifically, there exist a site for antigen gene expression. Switching to new antigenic variants is achieved by recombination into the specific site. Often times a silent antigen gene is copied and duplicated into the expression site deleting the resident gene. I am not exactly sure how the method helps researchers study such form of homologous recombination. Perhaps researchers can further venture into this. Most important limitation I believe the most important limitation of this study is the utilization of a model of T. Brucei which is incapable of undergoing apoptosis (due to the model’s inability to form short stumpy bodies). Since the entire study focuses on assessing parasitemia and relating the same to antigenic variation, how do researchers control for the effects of reduced apoptosis on the parasitemia? Another important limitation I would like to highlight is that involving the data presented in figure 5. The data in this figure is generated by the researchers testing for unique VSGs generated on day 6 in the blood. I wonder why this is the case. This is because in an earlier section, the researchers specifically mention that they did not assess for unique VSGs in day 6 since there were too few VSGs generated at the time. This makes me a bit skeptical about the results generated in day 6 since the data for the same in the context of unique VSGs was never presented. Another question that arises is why the authors specifically chose to study day 6 VSGs and exclude day 10 and 14 VSGs for this analysis. I believe that some rationale could be provided to better understand this choice of the author. Writing I would give this paper a score of 4 for its writing. This is because I genuinely feel that the researchers were able to communicate complex ideas in a simplistic and comprehensible manner. However, I think that certain terminologies such as tissue tropism, and certain concepts such as immune evasion could be further explained, since the audience may not have much science background. While I did not find any grammatical errors, I do think the researchers should keep track of the claims they make. For instance, in one section of the paper, the researchers wrote that they did not assess unique VSGs on day 6 since none were generated by then. However later onwards when describing the findings presented in figure 5, they stated that they assessed/looked for the unique VSGs on day 6 in the blood. These two statements appear contradictory and makes one skeptical over the writing and hence the overall study. Any questions the work leaves open? In this study the researchers find what they like to call unique VSGs. Unique VSGs are VSGs only expressed in certain spaces. I believe that the researchers can further expand on their study by assessing the role of these unique VSGs in tissue tropism. If the identified VSGs do play a role in tissue tropism, this can significantly uplift the impact factor of this research study given that tissue tropism changes during the course of infection and hence potentially serves a diagnostic tool. For instance, acute Toxoplasma gondii infections associate with gut cell invasion whilst chronic disease is characterized by brain invasion and neurological impairment. Trypanosome tropism towards the central nervous system causes a variety of sleep disturbances, psychiatric, motor, and sensory malfunctions. Hence understanding the potential of those unique tissue specific VSGs in T. brucei specific tropism can definitely improve the applicability of this particular paper. In this paper, the researchers show that majority of antigenic variation takes place in the extravascular spaces. It would be interesting to evaluate the survivability of the blood-resident VSGs prior to extravascular invasion using in vitro studies. This could potentially enable drug development which prevents the entrance of T. brucei into the extravascular spaces. In this study, the researchers only study VSGs for up to 14 days. At this point according to the researchers, tissue-resident populations only begin to diverge from one another and the blood. Studying longer periods of VSG expression can definitely help the researchers further address their aim of studying the role of extravascular parasites in T. brucei infection. I wonder why the researchers choose to only study 14 days post infection. Are there any limitations that restrict them for studying T. brucei for longer periods of time. The researchers in this paper also discuss about tissue-specific VSG selection. This seems to make quite a lot of sense. This is because other parasites like Plasmodium do express different var genes Besides studying for tissue-specific VSG selection, researchers in this study can also study the role of VSGs in things other than antigenic variation. According to Silva Pereira (20220, researchers are currently underestimating the extent to which VSGs are repurposed beyond their role as variant antigens. Indeed, there do exist nonvariant VSGs that perform specific functions such as serum-resistance associated VSG. To relate this future study with their antigen specific aims, they can assess how antigenic variations in VSGs evolve and or modify VSGs to carry out other unique functionalities. The researchers in this study discuss the applicability of their findings in the context of natural infections. They specifically claim that the variations can help the parasite survive in wild animals who may already have anti-VSG immunity. However, I feel that to improve the generalizability of the research’s findings to humans, researchers can assess if these antigen variation strategies enable the parasite to survive longer in a vaccinated human already acquiring VSG active immunity, nonvaccinated human already acquiring VSG herd immunity or infant already acquiring anti-VSG passive immunity. This can definitely be an interesting arena to look into.",2022-10-24T23:55:58,ShreyaJolly,Shreya Jolly,10.1101/2022.06.27.497797,Extravascular spaces are reservoirs of antigenic diversity in Trypanosoma brucei infection,"Alexander Beaver, Nathan P.

Overall, the article had a lot of information that supported how much fin whales depend on vocal learning and conformity. I felt that your abstract and introduction requires additional information to understand the paper. There was a clear definition for vocal learning, but conformity and what a singing season is was not well defined. Additional information on fin whales would have also been nice to better understand their behavior not in the context of song.

Figure 3 was clear to understand and it supported most of the claims that were made in the introduction. I thought it was very cool to see how many ways these figures could be interpreted. An additional suggestion that I have is for Figure 4, I felt like the figure caption was bare and was missing some information to make it easier to understand and there was not much detail into what this figure was supporting so I had to make my own inferences into what was being shown there.

Your paper on random subcloning was a fun read! It's a similar result to MacArthur's Broken Stick model for species-abundance distributions, and a cool analysis. While the maximum fragment length has high variance under the null hypothesis you consider elegantly in random subcloning, it does not have high variance under engineered infectious clones. The statistic ends up being elegant because not only does it contain information on regular spaced-ness of the restriction sites, but it also relates directly to the bioengineering constraint of plasmid stability. If we assume the probability of prohibitive plasmid instability increases monotonically with fragment length, longest-fragment-lengths give us a meaningful lower-bound on the probability a given infectious clone is synthesizable. Consequently, we chose maximum fragment length as our summary statistic of the restriction map to capture both even-spaced-ness and synthesizability, believing this would be the best statistic (if we had to choose just one) for identifying infectious clones. That said, we're fascinated to see what future work lays ahead, and believe it's likely better statistics and classifiers of infectious clones may exist, although with such a small sample size it's also quite easy to dredge the data and so we chose one statistic very carefully & stuck with that in our work here.

I’ve often read about this topic before, but this was a really novel take on the topic of antimicrobial resistance. Beginning with the introduction and abstract I thought there was sufficient background information provided on why this topic is important,  and why it is relevant to study today. In addition, it was also clear to me what the goal of this paper was (studying the effects of ARM-1 on Mfd). However, I would have preferred to see a little more background information on the Mfd compound. I understood how it operates to produce mutations, but I wish this compound was expanded upon a little more. Perhaps including some information on whether this compound is only seen in bacteria, and if not, are there any analogs in other organisms? Moving on to the first experiment, this was the only part of the study I had a little trouble understanding. I understood the underlying mechanisms that displayed the relationship of Mfd to the RNAP molecule, and how the ARM-1 compound thwarts this relationship. I just wish a little more context was provided as to how you arrived from 43 hits to ARM-1. When focusing on the next three figures presented I think that these were all done very well. I will, however, suggest for figure 2 perhaps splitting up the figure into two separate figures/parts. The first part containing information for figures 2A and 2B, and the next part containing information for figures 2C and 2D. I suggest this because the two halves of figure 2 discuss information that deals with separate topics. I thought that figure 3 was very clear and displayed your findings quite well!

In comparisons of very close relatives, one can see the inversions that led to this pattern. In comparisons of slightly more distant relatives, one could not really see the inversions but we saw an X-like pattens of conservation. This has been seen now in many many other comparisons of bacterial and archaeal genomes.

It was very informational and allowed for easy understandings of the goal of the research which i thought was pretty interesting. I did, however, have some questions about the main points. I think a point being proven was in regard to the  question about parasites expressing antigenic variation while in extracellular spaces. I was curious on when exactly the antigenic variation occurs. Is there a signal that notifies the parasite when to change the VSG coat also? I think ultimately these were questions the paper posed as well, however i think it could be beneficial to list some speculations on what you might think is occurring. It could help with providing some context in relation to this in the background. Also I was a bit unclear on the plan for future work.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.20.457079v3#comment-6020944090,biorxivstage,3,"In this paper, Weilnhammer et al. tackle an intruiging question at the heart of decision-making theory: do observers use stable strategies, or do their strategies ('modes') change within a session? This papers analyses the autocorrelation in perceptual decision-making, and finds that it fluctuates between externally- and internally-driven strategies in ways that are strikingly similar between humans and mice. I very much enjoyed reading this work. The topic is exciting, and together with the Ashwood paper (which I see as a companion) this work will undoubtedly spur many future developments across psychology and neuroscience. The author's commitment to open science is laudable, and I am glad to see them making such good use of open, large-scale, community-curated datasets. I do have a few questions that are important to fully understand and validate the author's conclusions, and several minor suggestions. My expertise lies in the analysis of behavioral data, so I will mostly comment on main figures 1-4 rather than the model in figure 5. I thank the authors for also sharing this work as a preprint. As a signatory of Publish Your Reviews, I have committed to publish my peer reviews alongside the preprint version of an article. Specfically, this review will also be posted on the bioRxiv comments section. For more information, see publishyourreviews.org. Major questions 1. Do mode fluctuations have a characteristic timescale? I find terminology like 'oscillated as 1/f noise' (l. 985) a bit confusing - there may be frequency-specific oscillations, *or* a 1/f spectrum, but these are not the same ( https://www.nature.com/arti.... While the 1/f characteristic is clearly shown in Figures 2D, 3D, 4D (and the authors discuss self-organized criticality), I could not reconcile this with some other aspects of the analyses and writing. First, are phase and coherence not usually computed as a function of frequency? If so, which frequency is used in Figure 2E,F? Methods section 7.3.4 and l. 148 could be elaborated for readers unfamiliar with spectral analyses of behavior (how should the units of coherence be intrepreted?). Second, how can the simulation with a phasic mode switch at a single frequency (Figure 5A) give rise to a 1/f spectrum (Figure 4D), rather than a spectrum with an oscillatory peak (l. 425)? Third, there is a long history of investigating oscillations in perception (work by Fries, VanRullen, Kastner and many others, as the authors cite) albeit at a much faster timescale than shown here. Since the unit in this manuscript is trials (not time), are these two lines of work inherently incomparable, or can something be said about the typical trial length and therefore the interpretation of the best-fitting f = 0.11 in their model fits (l. 890/891)? Throughout the manuscript, it would help to distinguish oscillatory vs. 1/f. Alternatively, I may fundamentally misunderstand the results, in which case further elaboration and clarification would be great. 4. It would be very helpful if the full set of figure panels (as in Figures 2, 3, 4) was reproduced for each of their control simulations (S4, S6, S7), to better compare these models' behavior against human and mouse data. This would increase confidence in the main findings, and further pinpoint what exact behavioral signatures are unique to bimodal inference (rather than arousal fluctuations or decision bouds). I would like to suggest further control analyses to strengthen the existing ones. First, to conclude that internal-external mode fluctuations do not reflect periods of 'limited capacity', 'energy budget' or 'unstructured neuro-cognitive noise' (section 5.3), can you simulate and fit data from a process that additionally (or only) has periods of low/high perceptual sensitivity or task engagement (for instance, simulating high lapses)? Especially in the mouse data (and shown by Ashwood, there are likely periods of disengagement from the task, e.g. when mice become satieted towards the end of the session. One prediction may be that this would lead to more errors in history-congruent modes (as in 3A), Second, recent work (reviewed in https://doi.org/10.51628/00... has shown that slow drifts in decision boundary, without any strategic history-dependent updating, may give rise to statistical confounds and apparent history-dependence. It is difficult to intuit how such a process may affect the analyses presented here: could the authors simulate a process with only a slowly drifting bound (beyond the static response bias in section 5.4)? Minor suggestions 1. I applaud the authors for sharing their full workflow on OSF. However, I did find the format (all files in a zip) a bit difficult to work with: for instance, it's not possible to view the code in-line without downloading. To further increase the usefulness of the codebase to others, consider exploring ways to present the code in a way that allows easy re-running, inspection and versioning (e.g. in a notebook form, or at least with the scripts on GitHub). Also, comments on how to use the files (where to start? how to install/run? what are the dependencies? what version of R?) would be of great help to others who want to implement the same method. 3. Could the authors show standard (and history-conditioned) psychometric curves in both modes? This would show if there are considerable lapses, which can bias the estimation of history-dependent logistic regression models (see http://www.journalofvision..... If lapses are considerable, this may need to be taken into account in the model (or at least simulated to check that it doesn't introduce confounds). Related to this, how many human studies did not have stimulus strength information (and thus presumably only one level of task difficulty), and do the results look the same without studies with these missing data? 17. The authors recognize that trial-to-trial variations in stimulus strength (i.e. task difficulty) are a major driver of choices, and account for this in their control analysis. However, when defining stimulus-congruence, this is (as far as I can tell) only done based on the sign (i.e. a binary indicator), thus removing the _degree_ of stimulus congruence. Would the results look the same is stimulus-congruence was instead coded as a continuous variable, i.e. being more congruent when stimulus strength is high? 18. Why not show the logistic regression results in Figure 2B, which takes into account several confounds that are now hidden in the supplement? 19. Why do the mixed effects models only have random intercepts, and not random slopes? It seems that sensory and history dependence vary substantially across observers, which random slopes could capture. 20. Consider visualizing the phase information (Figure 2E) on a circular plot. To better interpret the coherence and phase information (see my first main question), it would be very helpful to discuss whether the two modes are anti-correlated/alternate at a specific frequency. 21. Please define 'infra-slow' when first used (see first main question). Is this characterized by a specific frequency range? 22. I am unsure if the selection of IBL mouse sessions may affect these results. Specifically, the authors here use a simple performance criterion of 80% in easy trials. However, in this task contrasts were introduced gradually, meaning that 80% correct on easy trials may happen early on in training as well as very late (with very different contrast sets). In Figure S5, could it be indicated which sessions were incorporated into the main analysis? Would the results hold if using a more stringent criterion to consider animals 'trained', as proposed in the original IBL paper ( https://github.com/int-brai..., which also incorporates bias and lapses)? A related point is that TDs are a lot larger (Figure 3H) than in the original paper (IBL et al. 2021, Figure 3 - supplement 2A), which may be remarked upon. 23. Also Figure S5: it would be of great interest to also see the within-session changes in mode, for mice as well as humans (see also my main question above on satiety). 24. The green plots in Supplementary Figure 2 are interesting but also a bit worrying, showing all sorts of autocorrelation in the stimulus sequences that make the paper's conclusions trickier to assess. The authors already discuss some features of the IBL task design that introduce specific autocorrelation patterns (i.e. post-error bias correction). Is such information, describing the specific algorithms for sequence generation, available for the studies from the confidence database? And could the authors relate specific stimulus sequences to the behavioral modes they observe? 25. In section 5.7, it should be noted that mice did receive single-trial feedback. How about humans? Splitting the confidence database into those studies with and without single-trial feedback could be used to nicely test the predictions in line 549 / Figure 5. 26. RT distributions are characteristically long-tailed, which can strongly affect scaling them. I am a bit confused that all values in Figure 2H lie below zero, should this not be zero-meaned? Was a transform (e.g. log) used before zscore? If not, could the authors show the RT distributions per study before and after outlier removal and scaling, to give a better sense of the distributions that were used in the analyses (or replicate 2H without normalization so that the real RT units are visible, as in 3H)? It would also be nice to add the range of individual cutoff values used for exclusion criteria (l. 776). 27. To make the magnitude of weights in figure 2B, 3B and 4B easier to interpret, consider adding the weight for sensory stimuli (see Abrahamyan figure 3 - may need to be on a differen y-scale). 28. lines 436-445: are these correlations linear, or may there be quadratic relationships between posterior certainty and RT, confidence, TDs? A supplementary figure would be nice. 29. Very minor: I had some issues printing the figures, likely due to many transparent datapoints in the pdf. For the final version, consider exporting the figures to a high-resolution bitmap format to reduce the size. 30. The work contains a couple of remaining typos (e.g. ressource'), duplicate words, etc. 31. l. 148, S2F -> 2F. 32. l. 653, where in the Ashwood paper is this number of >100 trials mentioned? As far as I can tell, they only analyze the first 90 trials of each session (see their figure 3E). 33. Some references should be updated: for instance, 21 is now published in eLife, and 12 & 66 point to the same paper (published and preprint). Please check all the references to make sure that they point to the most recent versions. 34. Consider adding author contribution statement and/or displaying this visually (see e.g. https://twitter.com/Steinme..., https://elifesciences.org/a... figure 6). Also, is there a reason why one author is now omitted, compared to the first bioRxiv version? Further questions As with all fresh ideas, this work raises many more questions that it can answer: while beyond the scope of this manuscript, I list some here so that they may be of use to the community. - Especially together with the paper by Ashwood et al., the obvious next question is the structure of mode fluctuations: are there two modes (as suggested here) or more (as suggested by Ashwood)? Do these switch in a discrete vs. continuous way? - At what timescale do states/modes change? How does this relate to even slower timescales in biology, e.g. at the level of circadian rhythms? - It is fantastic to see that large-scale databases are increasingly being used for cross-species comparison. In a way, it's a shame that these exist only for humans and mice. Are there plans or efforts to collect and publish similar databases from non-human primates (where many, many trials of perceptual decision-making tasks have been collected over the years)?",2022-10-24T11:08:05,,Anne Urai,10.1101/2021.08.20.457079,Bimodal inference in humans and mice,"Veith Weilnhammer, Heiner Stuke, Kai Standvoss, Philipp Sterzer",2022-07-05

I recently read this paper with my program’s journal club, and I want to thank you for your work on mEVs and early biomarkers of tobacco smoking-induced disease. My class learned a great deal of information while reading and discussing this paper, and I would like to present some suggestions and comments: The variety of techniques utilized to isolate and characterize mEVs here were impressive. However, I suggest including percentage breakdowns of the different populations studied on the flow cytometry plots (Figure 2A, 2B, 2E). This data may have already been calculated through FlowJo or could easily be calculated with this software, and it would be valuable to display these percentages to provide more precise quantifications of EV populations. In addition, I believe that Figure 2D may have been incorrectly referred to as Figure 5D in the results section titled “Extracellular vesicle concentration increases in circulation 1 hour after smoking in never-smokers”. Also, in the results or discussion section, I would suggest including a description of why there are four post-smoking samples in Figure 2F compared to the 20 non-smoking participants or the nine pre-smoking samples shown in Figure 2F. Next, if possible, I would also suggest conducting the tests performed on nonsmokers in Figure 1 and 2 on smokers as well, which could provide additional data on the acute effects of smoking and if these effects change with the chronic smoking of tobacco. I understand that this data may be difficult to collect, but I believe that it could bolster the content of this paper. Lastly, I was wondering what specific statistical test you conducted for this figure. The figure legend states that a non-parametric unpaired t-test was performed. However, I wonder if a paired test should have been used, as this data consists of blood from the same individuals pre- and post-smoking. Thus, I do not know if the groups can be considered independent. Also, t-tests are parametric tests, so I am unsure of what a nonparametric t-test refers to. This pattern of referring to a nonparametric t-test was also maintained throughout the paper. Was a Wilcoxon signed-rank test performed? If not, then I would suggest implementing this statistical test here, as it serves a similar purpose to a t-test but is applicable to paired, nonparametric data. For the other instances of unpaired nonparametric t-tests, I would suggest using a Mann-Whitney U test, which also serves a similar purpose to a t-test but is applicable to unpaired, nonparametric data. In Figure 4B, I would suggest expanding the heatmap to display MFI levels for each sample analyzed instead of condensing the data as shown. In this condensed form, the data is a bit difficult to interpret. Alternatively, I would suggest displaying some of the quantifications of activation marker levels described in the results section, as these quantifications would convey the same message but through a more easily interpretable form. The discussion around Figure 5 depends on a trend shown in sTREM2 expression and a statistical decrease in BDNF expression. In the results and discussion sections, the following conclusions made about the smoking-linked mechanisms of neurodegeneration may be a bit strong based on this data. I would suggest performing follow-up experiments on other neurodegeneration markers to strengthen this evidence or perhaps test BBB functionality, as this was a concept linked to neurodegeneration throughout this paper. I have a quick general note on the references section. I had some trouble finding a few of the papers cited in-text in the references section (e.g. Zalba et al. 2007, Sophocles Chrissobolis et al. 2011). My class had similar difficulties navigating the references section, so I would suggest following up on the consistency of citations in-text and within this section.

Additionally, the analysis in the results and discussion were logical and easy to follow. I do think at times there is some confusion/ambiguity regarding the sample sizes for some tissues. In the methods section, you mentioned that 3 brain samples (2 day 10, 1 day 14) and 1 heart sample (day 10) were excluded from analysis. When talking about Figure 2A, you said that the initiating VSG was detectable in 23/24 tissue samples from day 10. I was wondering if that was supposed to be 20/21 tissue samples? I had a similar comment with figure 3C and figure 4, where the legends say that n = 4 for each tissue. I think it would be helpful to mention that n=2 for day 10 brain samples and n = 3 for day 10 heat/day14 brain samples in the legends of figures 3 and 4 in case a reader did not catch that in the methods section. I also had two minor comments regarding figures. For 2A and 2C, since you are comparing the blood to tissue spaces collectively, I don’t think having the tissues being different colors is necessarily useful. It might be visually beneficial if all tissue samples were the same color (i.e. blue) like they are in 3B. Additionally, for 2A, 2C, and 5, the Y-axes say Log10(% parasites), but the tick marks show actual per cents.",2022-10-24T01:42:04,,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2022.06.27.497797,Extravascular spaces are reservoirs of antigenic diversity in Trypanosoma brucei infection,"Alexander Beaver, Nathan P.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.05.510968v1#comment-6020623263,biorxivstage,0,"This manuscript presents a wealth of supporting data for evidence of vocal learning and conformity among whale songs in the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus). Romagosa and colleagues present a twenty-one yearlong observational study of three critical components of the songs produced by male fin whales. It is the first study to suggest a mechanism driving vocal learning and conformity in animal songs, specifically pertaining to the fin whale. Romagosa & colleagues’ comprehensive analysis includes a dearth of both temporal and spatial data. The assessment the inter-note interval (INI, i.e., rhythm), the 20-Hz note, and the High Frequency (HF) note of the fin whale song is used as a conduit by which the authors reveal patterns of change and adoption of different patterns over time. The authors use a wide geographical range, inclusive of 15 sampling locations grouped into 7 separate regions, with data collection spanning between 1999 and 2020. They provide thorough consideration of alternate interpretations of their data and use the existing literature to further bolster their proposed ideologies. This manuscript has immense potential to posit something novel to the field, based on the background the authors have provided. However, due to the seeming overreliance on existing literature in the discussion, limited exploration and elaboration on the data itself in the results section, and poor articulation of caveats in the sampling methodology, the significance of the findings presented are undermined. Based on the targeted journal, a re-organization of the manuscript’s structure may be suitable to address these more structural issues. Despite the incredible amount of data, there lacks thorough explanations of how the data directly supports the conclusions presented. The results section could be elaborated upon to increase the credibility of the stated conclusions (examples starting in line 93 through 106, 119 – 127, 136-144). The discussion section does not implicate the data presented in this paper in the conclusions being made by the authors as much as it should, and it seems to rely much more heavily on existing literature in the greater field (i.e., extending beyond marine mammals). Switching some of the description of the data from the discussion section into the results section will make both sections easier to read and understand. . As these studies are purely observational, the methodology should be highlighted more, and as stated previously, perhaps may merit a structural reorganization of the manuscript itself. Because of the several sampling differences such as those in instrumentation & manufacturer, including the supporting evidence for why these data are still usable and comparable is critical to the credibility of the work (see Supplementary Material, lines 30 – 50). This experiment should be included either in the main body of the text or highlighted more explicitly in the main body, so the reader knows to find it there. The inconsistencies between recording machinery need to be explained, as the authors have performed an additional study to verify these data. Using figure 1 to be referenced primarily by the methods section is a poor choice of ordering, and perhaps the visuals provided in figure 1 can be moved into the supplement since they are not showing any data. This would leave available a spot to move the experiment in the supplementary material into the main text. Additionally, including more detailed figure legends (i.e., explaining that each symbol represents an individual recording/represents one day, explaining the red circle in current figure 1A in the legend, etc.). The same descriptive wording used in the legend for Figure 3 (specifically the information provided in line 133 – 135) should be applied to all figures in both the main and supplemental data. The rationale for the groupings of regions in the histograms of INIs and HF note peaks in Figures 4A & B is unclear and not indicated. Figure 4B is not discussed in the text either. Having panels in figures that are not described in the text is confusing, as the reader cannot understand what the purpose is of what is being presented. Generally speaking, the manuscript was a delight to read. It was well-written, and I felt that the background and foundation for the work presented was laid out very well. This data that is being presented has exciting implications for the field and fills in a clear gap in knowledge. The amount of time and dedication that was given to these studies should not be understated. I felt that the authors framed their goals and provided comprehensive context for the material being shown.

As for feedback, I gathered from the article that this research contributes to the notion that scientists need a new way to think about targeting antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Here you provide the audience with a new method of preventing the bacteria from evolving at all. While previous interventions focused on killing the evolved bacteria. However, did you ask questions about addressing the bacteria that have already developed into something like, let’s say MRSA? Your approach evaluated in this research is new and innovative, but it does not mention the life of the bacteria after it has evolved as a limitation. With that said, I feel it would greatly benefit this article to contain a limitation section so you could reflect on possible improvements for future work and shortcomings of the current work. Other questions to address in this section would be what happens if AMR bacteria does evolve and what parameters are in place to inhibit it? Specifically, you leave the audience wondering how ARM-1 can be used medically. I feel since this is a huge component of why you did this research, it should be addressed in the conclusions section. How can it be used? For whom? What would access look like? Where is it most needed? Who and what countries could benefit? Why is this intervention the best course of action for people?  How could it actually be used as an anti-evolution drug? There is a disconnect for me when I compare the outcome of the research and how it can meaningfully impact medicine beyond just stating that it can. Although this paper was scientific, it is dense for someone coming from a non-science background to digest. I did feel it was logical and well-written but could have benefited from being broken up into more sections. I found myself rereading the results section since you combined the methods, results, and figures altogether and only had four subheadings. Although you have a discussion section, I felt that your discussion section was actually in your results section and that your discussion section acted as a conclusion section. This made it challenging for the reader to synthesize the results section in an efficient manner. From reading the summary, I felt the main idea is that the inhibition of Mfd activity by the lead compound ARM-1 delays the development of mutations and resistance acquisition in pathogens. This finding then demonstrates that molecular mechanisms are targetable which ultimately could prevent AMR in future pathogens. If this is not what you are trying to convey, then I would advise reworking your summary and or introduction. I agree with others that replication of the study could benefit more concrete findings to solidify the argument this article is making. I do feel this paper dives into some really interesting questions which I feel need to be explored further. In terms of the next steps and future experiments, figuring out how your research fits into the lifecycle of the AMR bacteria could prove insightful. Overall, good job, it is an important research topic that has not been addressed in the way you present it and I feel it is adding to the field of science.

Great background information overall, nothing much to critique. The discussion I felt that you all, elaborated very well on their findings, missed out on discussing further research. I also felt that it was not as interesting as the introduction and could have added a bit more future research.

Thus, any hypothetical engineer of the RE sites would have to go to enormous lengths to purposefully mimick natural bat coronaviruses that have only been discovered in the past 2 years: a very dubious proposition. The far simpler alternative is that the sites evolved via natural recombination from natural bat coronaviruses. Further, if one examines the genomic regions around each restriction enzyme sites, we find that SARS-CoV-2 shares general genetic similarity with the virus(es) it shares the RE site (or lack therefore) with. This would further indicate that they were inherited via recombination. For example, two BsaI sites missing in SARS-CoV-2 are also missing in the RpYN06 batCoV, which follows naturally from the phylogenetic prediction that RpYN06 is the nearest neighbor in that region. Correspondingly, SARS-CoV-2 shares not just the lack of the BsaI sites in this region, but several other mutations as well: a signal entirely inconsistent with engineering and entirely consistent with natural recombination. The same is true with other natural batCoVs if you examine any of the RE sites described in this work. For the engineering hypothesis, this would have to imply that someone not only modified the RE sites to match natural viruses, but also unrelated nearby sites as well - an even more ludicrous proposition that I do not think even these authors can defend. Finally, this sort of analysis can be be done systematically by reconstructing a recombinant ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, as the two papers below did: https://www.nature.com/arti... (See Fig 2) https://www.science.org/doi... (See Fig 6) The recombinant ancestor is a reconstruction of the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and other known bat viruses in each region of the genome. The recombinant ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 indeed shares the exact BsaI/BsmBI RE pattern of SARS-CoV-2, minus a signal synonymous mutation: thus further proving that these sites were naturally acquired via recombination. This follows intuitively from the observation that different bat viruses each have some of the RE sites described in this work, and that each bat virus that shares an RE or lack therefore with SARS-CoV-2 is the most recent common ancestor of that genomic region.

Just goes to show the strength of researcher collaboration for the purposes of broadening our understanding of important topics. I do, however, have some comments on your paper which I would like to share. I should preface this with a  statement of reflexivity - noting that I am not a marine biologist or within an associated field of interest, but have a background in the social sciences and an interest in One Health. Further, as a current academic and researcher in the social sciences I view your work through the lenses inherent to my discipline. I acknowledge the limitation that my lack of prior technical knowledge in this field brings, and intend to provide a critical perspective that may conform to those that also view your paper without prior technical knowledge. That said, I was initially drawn to your article because of your title. As such, based on your title I was expecting to read about a novel new notion of 'song conformity among fin whales'. Through your background, and discussion sections, I learnt that song conformity is an established notion for many animals, and species of whales - including fin whales (Line 243). So, while the title is clear and short, it also leads the reader to expect to learn about a new concept that is 'song conformity', but you later note that evidence of song conformity exists among fin whales already. Perhaps your paper would benefit from a reevaluation of the title to clarify that you intend to show, through a synthesis of multiple study datasets, trends within fin whale songs over a long time horizon. In your abstract, I thought you presented your main arguments quite well (Lines 25-28), though could have added a little more detail on your methodological choice and your study population (male fin whales) - perhaps in Lines 23-24. In Line 29, you note that you found ""evidence of vocal learning of rhythm"" and ""conformity"" - these are strong findings - and I was keen to read more. I thoroughly enjoyed reading your introduction, and I was most interested in reading your problem statement - and more specifically, the gap in the literature that you were trying to fill. In Lines 59-63 you note four distinct gaps that is our understanding of (1) the functional mechanisms of vocal learning, (2) natural selection and learning strategies, (3) the benefits of song conformity and (4) individual decisions impacting song evolution. You also note that ""vocal learning of rhythm is ... poorly understood"" [Line 62], and research focuses on complex songs. You call for ""a broader view"" to piece a part the different mechanisms of vocal learning to better understand prevalence and evolution [Lines 63-65]. Here I was anticipating a little more detail on what you meant by ""different mechanisms"". Also, while it was certainly interesting to read about all the gaps in our understanding of vocal learning and conformity, it wasn't immediately clear to me which of these gaps your work was seeking to address. A little more clarity here would have helped. In your methods section, I was intrigued to read about the processes that were involved in the creation of your analytical dataset. It seems like you had some challenges synthesizing inconsistent recordings which created some gaps in your dataset, and necessitated the exclusion of some data. Since the data was so critical to your examination of trends in songs over time, it would have helped to provide a figure tracking the data itself - e.g., the amount/type/nature of data that was available to you, the amount/type/nature of data that was excluded, and the amount/type/nature of data that made it into your final analytical dataset. Furthermore, I would have liked to have read a little more about your statistical assumptions. You employ the use of histograms to compare song distributions among periods/regions, I would have liked to have read a little more about whether you performed statistical analyses to assess distributional similarities (KS test?). In your results section, Figure 2 was intended to demonstrate song changes over time. Using the ONA SE dataset you present avg. song INIs over time, a stacked bar chart summarizing the three song types within the period, and a spatial presentation of this stacked bar chart. Maybe I missed it, but it wasn't clear to me how you technically defined and labelled ""hybrid"" songs in your dataset - from Figure 2 Panel A I noticed song INIs that fell within the 12s-19s range but the confidence intervals appeared to overlap into both the 12s and 19s ranges. Without further information, this did not appear to be clear evidence of a hybrid song. Much more clarity on how you defined hybrid songs, as well as an accompanying (supplementary) table on statistical summaries would strengthen your work here in my opinion. Figures 3 and 4 intended to show long term song trends (in avg. song INIs and two song parameters), and distributional comparisons of song INIs for regions and periods where simultaneous recordings were made, respectively. Much more clarity on the organization and interpretation of the data for Figure 3A would have been appreciated. Multiple ocean regions are plotted on the same graph, and a trend line is plotted through them. My first question is, are these regions comparable enough to be plotted side-by-side? For in other words, did these regions start from the same origin point? Is the trend being largely driven by ONA or the BBIC? Finally, in your discussion section, you do a good job contextualizing your research. And, explain your results through factual and counter-factual arguments (e.g., these results can't mean 'this' because if they did 'this' is what we would have found). At times, you extend the meaning behind your results a little too far for comfort - for example, when describing your results in the context of mating [Lines 241-254]. The arguments make sense, but without further evidence, it veers into conjecture. Though, in my opinion, this is a problem with the way you've framed your discussion pieces rather than a problem with the content itself. It would have been helpful to read a section on the limitations of your study design, and limitations of your study findings which would have clarified areas where you noticed anomalous results (such as the Barents Sea findings). All-in-all good work, though as a lay-reader, I did need more information at times and some clarity on your processes.",2022-10-22T22:22:22,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2022.10.05.510968,Fin whale singalong: evidence of song conformity,"Miriam Romagosa, Sharon Nieukirk, Irma Cascão, Tiago A.

I was also very glad to see that ARM-1 can delay the onset of AMR in multiple strains and even in strains that already devleoped resistance, which looks much promising/hopeful. However, I do have some questions about your experimental design and results. So for your highthrough-put drug screen, I saw that you used two plasmids, one with IPTG-inducible promoter, the other one with LacI/LacO roadblock. I just wonder if IPTG, which mimics allolactose, would have any off-target effect on LacI repressor? I can clearly tell that your ARM-1 inhibits mfd by your following results, but I was just wondering why you did not use any promoter that is inducible by any compounds other than allolactose analog. (Also I could only see panel 1a for supplementary figure 1, did you forget to upload the other panels?) Another question is about Figure 2c. I noticed that with the presence or absence of ARM-1, the EC values are roughly the same in this figure. You reasoned it as ""The reduction in the ECs in the presence of ARM-1 is most likely because, at equilibrium, when RNAP cannot dissociate from DNA, it cannot re-initiate transcription, consequently preventing new EC formation."", which did not make much sense to me at first. If that is the case, the EC value with ARM-1 should still be higher than that of the group without ARM-1, unless ARM-1 is not working at all. So I checked the supplementary material, and found that you repeated the expeiment, and the mean value for ARM-1 -ve group is 0.40, that for ARM-1 +ve group (different conc) range from 0.6-0.8, and this makes much more sense now. So I think if you should put the mean value in Fig 2c instead? (For supplementary figure 3, in panel a I saw two 25 and one 12.5 microM ARM-1 tested, but in panel b I saw two 12.5 microM and one 25 microM in the table, you might want to double check on that.)

It is my pleasure to make these remarks. The work is well structured, well researched, and properly presented, easy to read even for non-scientific audiences. When going through the details though, I could not keep the concepts of hospital-acquired infections, antibiotic resistance, and the emergence of novel diseases out of my mind, particularly because of how they are linked to the overall concept of microbial diversity and adaptability. For antimicrobial resistance, for instance, the underlying factor has everything to do with the transfer of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) between two genomes. When MGEs access the chromosomes of new bacterial hosts, the outcome is phenotypical alteration. If the MGEs contained antibiotic resistance then novel or ongoing pathogenesis may result. Nevertheless, your study has demonstrated that bacterial species rarely cross environmental barriers. However, it is interesting to note that this is not the entirety of the results because there are distinct transitions between aquatic biomes, which, noteworthy, are ancient, rare, and often directed towards the brackish biome. At the same time, there are frequent transitions into brackish sites, which are harder to explain. I am just concerned, are there tests that can ascertain these claims? Previous studies have identified that bacteria are opportunistic and may manipulate any loophole to establish supremacy. The concern is further aggravated by your additional findings, that brackish bacteria often exhibit enriched gene functions for various physiological responses, including transcriptional regulation, which is integral in the re-writing genetic information, further begging the question should there be a cause for worry.",2022-10-22T00:15:10,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2022.10.03.510577,Large-scale phylogenomics of aquatic bacteria reveal molecular mechanisms for adaptation to salinity,"Krzysztof T Jurdzinski, Maliheh Mehrshad, Luis Fernando Delgado, Ziling Deng, Stefan Bertilsson, Anders F Andersson",2022-10-03
