The authors present a lot of data and the results about temperature-dependent PapR maturation reveal new information about the mechanisms underlying quorum-sensing in these bacteria. However, in my opinion, the conclusions regarding expression heterogeneity are based on data that present a major flaw. Plasmid pHT315 is not appropriate for the measurement of fluorescence intensity because it induces heterogeneity in itself, probably because of its copy number. The authors should have verified this by using a control such as the promoter of a constitutively-expressed gene. They would have seen the same kind of result as they see with PlcR-regulated genes. Plasmid pHT304 should have been used instead. The reference for plasmid pHT315 is wrong. It should be Arantes and Lereclus Gene. 108 (1991)115-l 19. The difference in cell morphology between strains that only differed by the reporter fusion they carry is also puzzling (chains or filaments, it's difficult to say, versus individualized cells ; Figure 2). Are the bacteria sick? Could this influence the expression results? It would have been helpful to show the growth curves corresponding to each strain at each temperature to determine if bacterial growth was affected by the reporters used.",2023-02-09T15:07:21,leylaslamti,Leyla Slamti,10.1101/2022.07.06.498675,From cereus to anthrax and back again: The role of the PlcR regulator in the “cross-over” strain Bacillus cereus G9241,"Shathviga Manoharan, Grace Taylor-Joyce, Thomas A.

PsaJ is just downstram from the PsaF gene, just like in most other cyanoabcteria, but for some reason the gene is not discovered/detected by annotation methods. I found it in G. violaceus and Anthocerotibacter manually, and it is indeed annotated in G. kilaueensis, I believe... it was also seen in the G. violaceus PSI structure published recently, but not annotated properly. The PsaI subunit is also found, at least in some Gloeobacter strains, and it was originally annotated as PsaZ. The new structure of the PSI from G. violaceus show that PsaZ is PsaI, it's just that they are such small genes that sequece identity become unreliable for orthology searches... It's possible that some of the other ""missing"" genes of the photosystems and cyt b6f, which are mostly very small genes, encoding a ~40 amino acid proteins, suffer of the same detectability issues.",2023-02-07T16:49:51,tanaicardonalondoo,Tanai Cardona Londoño,10.1101/2023.02.03.526606,Novel diversity of polar Cyanobacteria revealed by genome-resolved metagenomics,"Igor S.

This hypothesis is purely based on the fitting of atomic models in the extra densities. No experimental evidence to support this hypothesis is provided. The idea that RNA assembles together with amyloids has been proposed; the new contribution here is the fitting of atomic models. But, because of disorder and a possible mismatch with the imposed helical symmetry, the quality of the extra densities is generally poor. Therefore, the potential fit of atomic models of molecules in these densities is not enough evidence to conclude that such molecules are responsible for these densities. More experimental data will be needed to find out what molecules are responsible for these extra densities, which would have potentially important implications for our understanding of these diseases.",2023-02-07T09:28:11,sjors_scheres,Sjors Scheres,10.1101/2023.02.01.526613,RNA as a component of fibrils from Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerations,Leslie R.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.02.506428v1#comment-6109028475,biorxivstage,1,"The following is an anonymous review, edited by James Fraser, that is largely concordant with the reviews of this manuscript posted by eLife. James is posting it on behalf of the author (who wishes to remain anonymous) to provide additional background context on the issue of how Orf3a could be misidentified as an ion channel. This paper is welcome because the biophysical aspects of previous viroporin work are problematic. The virology and other aspects of those works are presumably technically correct. But this speaks to the problems of silos, and that at some point virology and biophysics really need to sit down and have a talk. Below, I highlight how the papers from the virology labs are weak in the biophysical aspects. Consequently, the field is replete with exceedingly poorly executed and reviewed biophysics work that has proven to be irreproducible. A nice review  ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... by Colin Nichols and Conor McClenaghan outlines the problems with the interpretations in previous work using bilayers, oocytes or mammalian cells. This paper by Miller/Clapham sets the record straight with regard to SARS CoV 2 protein 3a. It builds on Steve Grant in Henry Lester's lab at Caltech work ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih..., which has shown that there is no evidence for 3a forming functional channels in oocyte plasma membranes. The Grant/Lester paper did a nice control using Spike and nsp2, which have never been claimed to have ion channel activity. These papers are necessary because of previous, poor-quality papers, which claimed channel activity. For example, Toft-Bertelsen et al. ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go... suggested that 3a was an ion channel.  This paper claimed that numerous other viral accessory proteins - 7 or 8 of them also acted as ion channels, which prompted some skepticism in the field. That paper lacked important controls (e.g. no controls for proteins known not to be an ion channel, like Spike as done in the Grant/Lester paper). The major issue is that it was not properly controlled for the issue of endogenous background channels, sadly ( which is should be pointed out by reviewers as electrophysiology 101). Importantly, the Toft-Bertelsen work didn't even demonstrate that the proteins were in the plasma membrane. Without engineering the expression construct, it is almost certainly all in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, ERGIC). Sixteen biophysicists recently commented in Communications Biology ( https://www.nature.com/arti... on the shortcomings of the Todt-Bertelsen paper, explained several possible sources of artifact, and outlined experimental steps that could be followed to claim ion channel function. There are also papers on the E and 3a proteins that use only bilayer recordings. Two papers on SARS-CoV-1 from the Enjaunes lab show channel records that are scaled multiples of one another. In other words, the E channel (Figure 3a of Verdia-Baguena https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...) and the 3a channels (Figure 3 of Castaño-Rodriguez https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...) appear to be exact scaled copies of the same trace. This example has no rational explanation, but it is illustrative of the problems in the field. It doesn't reflect well on the reviewers and editors of those papers. An example of the steps for Ion channel function being met is observed for the E protein, which is likely to be a channel similar to the M2 of influenza ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go.... Problematic aspects of other previous studies contrasting E and 3a are also reviewed here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go.... The structure of Orf3a is described by Kern et al ( https://www.nature.com/arti.... Key evidence for the channel function is provided by its sensitivity to ruthenium red, which blocks quite a few ubiquitous channels including those found in intracellular organelles. This results provide the main reason for skepticism of an Orf3a-specific result for this due to the high protein ratios. It is possible this is real, but it is unproven. One should keep in mind that ions can get across membranes in multiple ways, so this doesn't have to be by conduction? The current Miller et al manuscript ( https://www.biorxiv.org/con... ) argues strongly against Orf3a channel function and provides an explanation for the results in Kern et al. Miller et al, only saw channels in proteoliposome patch-clamp recordings under the highest protein conditions used. These channel recordings were sensitive to DIDS and therefore likely to be due to contamination by VDAC or something similar.",2023-02-06T22:17:47,fraserlab,Fraser Lab,10.1101/2022.09.02.506428,"The SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein Orf3a is not an ion channel, but does interact with trafficking proteins","Alexandria N.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.02.514751v1#comment-6109000141,biorxivstage,2,"Cryo-crystallography is one of the most common techniques used in x-ray data collection of macromolecules. This is because cryogenically freezing crystals helps minimize radiation damage and extend crystal lifetime which allows for complete data sets collected from single crystals. However, proteins are not rigid and exist as a conformational ensemble. This is relevant for studying protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions because some binding/interaction sites may require alternative side-chain conformations or subtle backbone changes that may be inaccessible under cryogenic conditions due to shifting the energy landscape. In this paper, the authors sought to address the protein-ligand interactions at room temperature (RT) by performing a large crystallographic fragment screen. They utilized the therapeutic target PTP1B using 2 RT screens which consist primarily of fragments that have been tested previously at cryogenic temperatures. The main outcome of this paper reveals novel ligand binding poses in allosteric sites which is relevant for understanding allosteric mechanisms, however, at RT relatively fewer weakly-binding fragments are found. Along with this, a new fragment-binding site is also reported in the paper - importantly this site was identified at RT, but not by any fragments at cryo temperature. The last section of the paper also describes the identification of a fragment bound to the Lys197 of the allosteric site. The binding pose of the fragment at this position is similar to a covalent inhibitor to the mutant protein. The major strength of this paper is demonstrating that RT screening has the potential to reveal additional allosteric binding sites that may otherwise be inaccessible at cryogenic temperatures. The major limitation of this paper is the low coverage of chemical space due to focusing on previous fragments that were detected under cryo conditions and could be strengthened with a broader screen of chemical space for fragments that were not previously tested. Further, the lower hit rate compared to cryo screening may limit the utility of RT screening in a structure based drug-design approach. The paper is written concisely with a clear focus on the comparison of fragment binding at RT and cryo temperatures, however lacking few things which we would like to highlight below: Major points: In Figure 5, the authors point out that cryo and RT fragments can bind at the same site but in different poses to suggest relevance in allosteric inhibitor design but don’t fully explore the chemical rationale for alternate binding poses. It would be beneficial if the authors could describe the environment around the alternate binding poses to potentially explain if both conformations are relevant or if one is more likely than the other. In Figure 6A, the authors claim that a previously modeled cryo pose does not correspond well with the RT event map, however we feel that the event map appears to plausibly support both conformations. The only conclusion we can draw from here is the presence of water molecule in cryo and not in RT density. It may be worthwhile to try paired refinement to determine if the absence of the water at RT is due to resolution differences between the two data sets. In Figure 7A, the authors claim that the RT event map supports a flipped pose for fragments compared to cryo, however, the cryo event map is ambiguous and the absence of density (owing to lower resolution for this dataset at cryo?) suggest that the cryo ligand may be modeled incorrectly. Minor: Fig S4-H: Does the RT event map support alternate conformation for the fragment/ too ambiguous? Or is it a case of a new binding pose at the same site? In Figure 8A: 38A in legend or 40A in text? In Figure 9, the authors explain that the isatin-based fragment is covalently linked to Lys197 at RT but not cryo and suggest that the absence of this fragment from cryo may be due to insufficient soaking. It seems reasonable to follow up this “cryo-non-hit” by examining the effect soaking duration has on ligand binding for cryo. The manuscript would also benefit from a chemical schematic showing the covalent mechanism. NOTE - This paper was selected by the lab members for a group discussion. JSF was the postdoctoral advisor of Keedy and graduate advisor for Biel, who are authors on this paper - and is acknowledged in the manuscript for helpful discussions prior to posting the preprint. Thus, there is a conflict of interest that may color others' assessment of the review, which was driven by group members.

I have a suggestion if you are going to be modelling more variants in the future. I have developed a PCR based method to identify engineered missense variants and this is faster/cheaper/easier than using restriction digest. Essentially you design a PCR primer that is complementary to the engineered mutations and this will specifically amplify in the mutant. Typically there are 3-6 mutations (missense + silent) in this region so it is specific enough to not amplify wild-type.

Some figures exceeding 80% appear in the literature. As is mentioned in the article, these parasite forms are known as ""hypnozoites"", a term I coined 45 years ago [1]. This hypnozoitophilic dogma is, entirely logically, based on extrapolation from the results of drug treatment of patients with P. vivax malaria. However, the idea does not make sense to me parasitologically. It is not necessarily correct, for reasons explained elsewhere [2,3]. The point is that a proportion of relapse-like P. vivax malarial recurrences might originate from concealed merozoites (a recently confirmed parasite reservoir), as opposed to hypnozoites [3]. The suggestion was originally made 12 years ago [4]. It is not so much a question of why would these merozoites be a source of recrudescent P. vivax malaria but, rather, why would they not be? Luckily, evidence one way or the other should soon be forthcoming from drug-related experimentation using humanized mice [2]. Following on from the novel research concerning inhibition of hypnozoite and hepatic schizont activity that is reported in this bioRxiv paper, perhaps the authors could consider investigating, in addition, what might inhibit non-circulating P. vivax asexual stages (they did include P. falciparum blood stages in their study), such as occur in vast numbers in bone marrow and the spleen. I.e. if feasible. These hidden merozoites may be responsible for numerous clinical malarial episodes and it is possible that they are at least as problematic as hypnozoites.

We selected your paper to discuss in our undergraduate Journal Club seminar and I wanted to share some of the thoughts and suggestions that came up as we were discussing it. Firstly, thank you for sharing your science and for posting it here! The subject matter of this paper was extremely interesting, and we all enjoyed reading your paper. The background information was presented in a manner that was clear, concise, and detailed; this allowed us (non-experts) to easily engage with your research. Additionally, we came up with some suggestions for your paper: 1)	In Figure 5, we thought it might be nice to present the gene-network and GSEAs in another format. For individuals that are not familiar with these types of analyses, it is rather difficult to infer what’s going on within the figure from just the paper alone. Therefore, an alternative presentation of the data (perhaps in a table or heatmap format) may make it even more accessible. 2)	It seems that the same control was used within Figure 3 and 4 (as the control brain image is the same across both figures); therefore, we suggest that these be combined into one large figure. 3)	Additionally, we noted that single-end RNA sequencing was employed; however, due to the limitations with this technique, in terms of reconstructing transcripts, it may be nice to repeat this experiment with pair-end RNA sequencing. Single-cell RNA sequencing would be even better than pair-end RNA sequencing; however, we acknowledge the immense cost of this technique. 4)	In terms of the RNA experiments, we suggest that the average length of transcripts be noted within the methods section as this would give the reader an indication of the quality of transcripts. 5)	Lastly, we also suggest that the plunger plots within Figure 2 be replaced with a violin plot or a box and whisker plot. We suggest this because within Figure 2b, you can see that there is a lot of variation within the Core group. This variation would be best illustrated with a different plot type and would provide a reader with a visualization of the skew in the data. Overall, we really enjoyed reading this paper and thank you for sharing it here",2023-02-02T20:04:27,francescaday,Francesca Day,10.1101/2023.01.10.523434,Spatial distribution and functional relevance of FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression for glioblastoma tumor invasion,"Nawal Alshahrany, Ana Jimenez-Pascual, Florian A Siebzehnrubl",2023-01-10

I enjoyed reading your paper which intrigued me so much. I have some experience with glioblastoma, so knowing more about them are helpful for me. After reading through the paper, I like how you are bringing ideas on the frontline. From your paper, I learned that FGFR1 and 2 are expressed in both in vitro and in vivo but may have spatial heterogeneity in regions of tumor, also FGFR receptors have antagonist effect on tumor prognosis or potentially on invasion. I also like how the networks presented in the last figure yield some more interesting markers that could be studies further. Here is something I like about this paper: 1.	The paper uses clear languages and explanation that could be easily understand. 2.	I like how you incorporate xenograft model for in vivo study. 3.	I like how you incorporate different types of controls: loading control and positive control ShCo on WB and validation of antibodies / xenograft models. 4.	Additionally, I like how you refer back to in vitro study in your paper, while also mentioning the in vivo results. Here is something I think you could think further / consider for improvements. 1.	For figure 1, even though you test the antibodies and xenograft model, it is interesting that you put failed antibody as your first panel. I don’t usually see this in published papers, I think putting these failed ones in supplementary details are better. 2.	For figure 2, I think the way data is presented could be improved. From my perspective, the data wasn’t normally distributed, thus using mean and standard deviation, as well as plunger plots, are not good graphical choices. Better choices are violin plots and box-and whisker plots, since they show variance and raw data distribution (whether it is skewed). 3.	For study design, you mentioned that you measured percentage of FCFRs in vitro in your previous paper, would you consider also measuring the amount of FCFRs in vivo models? It might be interesting to compare how much percentage of cells express in vivo model, which may provide insights on whether targeting these receptor is good for regulating/inhibiting global tumor invasion. 4.	For figure 3 and 4, I think you also use the same control for both, which may be better to combine into one figure. Otherwise, two sets of control should be used, as the condition may have changed as you run the experiments at different times. I think using ANOVA here would be better. I am also wondering why brain slices shown are incomplete, I think for publication quality, it would be better to put full brain slice in the panel. 5.	For figure 5, I think it is hard to interpret it without some experience with bulk-rnaseq. I hope it could be explained better in the results or method section. Also, putting software generated figures is not a wise choice, because it is not annotated. I think it would be better to make your own plots, or flowchart to show how they work for clarity. My collogue also pointed out the lack of FGFR2 data here, despite it being nonsignificant. 6.	The supplementary figure is extremely blurry, which is hard to read. Overall, thank you for doing the research and sharing it here. Love the passion and hope to see more research on this. I hope my comment somewhat helps to discern some confusion from someone with a bit of cancer experience.",2023-02-02T19:51:11,disqus_3CuY4i52sl,Oliver Xu,10.1101/2023.01.10.523434,Spatial distribution and functional relevance of FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression for glioblastoma tumor invasion,"Nawal Alshahrany, Ana Jimenez-Pascual, Florian A Siebzehnrubl",2023-01-10

This immune function of DCL2 is independent of its canonical function in RNA interference through small RNA. The strength of the study is in the genetic dissection of the autoimmune phenotype caused by DCL2 that was previously described in literature. The authors use phenotypic analysis combined with RNA sequencing in Arabidopsis to show that DCL2 triggers activation of immunity and an autoimmune phenotype through at least two NLR proteins (L5 and RPP9). This is a novel and important discovery. They show that this activity is cytoplasmic and not nuclear. Interestingly, immunity is also activated in tomato by DCL2 and moss by DCL3, suggesting this mechanism is evolutionarily highly conserved. These conclusions are well supported by data and well presented. However, the evidence for an antiviral function of this pathway is not sufficient for the strong claims made in this paper. References to virus are made in the title, the abstract, results and conclusions, and are an important part of the paper, so major concerns need to be addressed. These are listed below, with suggested experiments. -	The virus infection results are not conclusive. For example, in Fig 4A dcl4/l5 line 1 shows more virus accumulation than dcl4/l5 line 2 (which in turn accumulates as much virus as the dcl4 single mutant), while in Fig 4B the opposite is true. In fact, in Fig 4B the l5 mutation is not additive to dcl4 mutation in terms of antiviral defense. In Fig 4B the dcl2 mutant shows significantly less accumulation than WT, which is not the case in Fig 4A and in literature. All this points to high stochastic variability between samples, which can be expected when working with pathogens. It is highly appreciated that the authors show conflicting results between experiments, but these results need to be robust given their importance for the conclusions of the paper. One possible explanation for this variability could be the use of labile in vitro transcripts as inoculum. This could be solved by either randomizing the plants when infecting (not one genotype after the other, if this wasn’t done) and/or use systemically infected tissues from inoculated dcl2/dcl4 mutants as inoculum for rub inoculation (although this TCV clone has no CP, which could be a problem). In any case, the infection experiments need to be repeated with more biological replicates per genotype, in the key genotypes Col, dcl4, l5, rpp9, dcl4/l5, dcl4/rpp9. -	A VSR-impaired virus should not be used to test whether DCL2 has an RNAi-independent function. As this virus is very sensitive to RNAi, in this experimental setup this pathway cannot be uncoupled from the proposed dsRNA-DCL2-NLR sensing pathway. In addition, the P38 VSR is also the viral coat protein, loss of which could impact the viral life cycle and accessibility of dsRNA structures in vivo. On the other hand, the use of wild-type TCV, encoding a very efficient VSR, would reliably show whether DCL2 has a small RNA/AGO-independent antiviral function. In this case WT, dcl4, l5 and rpp9 should show similar levels of virus accumulation, while dcl4/l5 and dcl4/rpp9 should show increased accumulation, if the hypothesis is valid. As above, several replicates should be analyzed. -	A central conclusion in this paper is that DCL2 is a sensor of dsRNA that activates innate immunity through NLRs. While the fact that DCL2 is an RNAseIII strongly suggests that it senses dsRNA, there is limited experimental evidence for this (the knock-out of RNA decay factors in literature and the experiments with TCV-deltaP38 - see comments above). Two experimental approaches would significantly strengthen these conclusions. (1) Treatment with a dsRNA analogue such as poly I:C of the various dcl/NLR mutants described in the paper. Activation of immunity can be assessed by quantifying expression of immune-responsive genes as in Supplementary Figure 1 or as described in literature (DOI: 10.1111/pbi.13327, DOI: 10.1042/EBC20210100). Performing this experiment on WT, dcl2, l5, rpp9, dcl2/l5 and dcl2/rpp9 should genetically determine whether DCL2 activates innate immunity through L5 and RPP9 NLR receptors upon detection of dsRNA. (2) Perform infection experiments with phylogenetically distant RNA viruses, and test activation of immunity as in (1). Available and routinely used in Arabidopsis are, among others, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), Tobacco rattle virus (TRV), Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV), Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and Turnip crinkle virus (TCV – see above). These virus species have very different proteomes, replicate on different organelles, have different capsid shapes, etc. If several of these activate immunity in a DCL2/NLR-dependent fashion, the case for DCL2 being a sensor for dsRNA in vivo would be far more robust. Using these viruses to infect Col, dcl4, l5, rpp9, dcl4/l5, dcl4/rpp9, then assessing viral accumulation, would indicate that in addition to activating immunity, this mechanism also has antiviral activity. If these points are not addressed, I believe that claims of immune activation by viruses and antiviral activity should not be present as major conclusions in the paper. They could be suggested in the discussion. In addition, conclusions regarding dsRNA as the trigger for immunity should be tempered. It is my hope that these experiments will be conducted, and if the current conclusions of the authors are substantiated, this is a very significant discovery and advancement in plant virology and immunity. Next are listed some minor points to address. -	The authors refer to antiviral RNAi function of DCL2 as being dependent on the genetic abrogation of DCL4. The authors state more than once that DCL4 is the main antiviral Dicer, with DCL2 dicing only when DCL4 is somehow overwhelmed by viral dsRNA. This view is not up to date, as more recent studies have shown that in WT plants DCL2 can be an active antiviral RNAi player, depending on virus species and/or tissue (e.g.: doi: 10.1038/nplants.2017.94; doi: 10.1093/nar/gkab802), suggesting that precise function and context of DCL2 in antiviral RNAi remain poorly understood. This should at least be mentioned. -	A whole section in the middle of the manuscript delineates the model proposed by the authors, while describing some of the results. In my opinion this interrupts the flow of the manuscript. The results should be presented as in the rest of the manuscript, while the model should be built in the discussion or at the end of the results. A partial model is also presented in Figure 2, taking away space for data. -	The authors end the final paragraph of the results with “when RNAi has been abrogated by mutation of DCL4”. KO of DCL4 does not abrogate antiviral RNAi, it reduces its efficacy. This should be corrected.",2023-01-31T18:53:04,,Marco Incarbone,10.1101/2023.01.10.523395,Sensing of viral RNA in plants via a DICER-LIKE Ribonuclease,"Carsten Poul Skou Nielsen, Lijuan Han, Laura Arribas-Hernández, Darya Karelina, Morten Petersen, Peter Brodersen",2023-01-11

For instance, the records and molecular data of Botrylloides niger, Symplegma brakenhielmi, and Polyclinum constellatum. Regarding P. constellatum, in fact neither Aydin-Önen et al. (2018) nor Montesanto et al. (2022) addressed this species as a cryptogenic. This species has undoubtedly recently arrived in the Mediterranean, although Virgili et al. (2022) has backdated its arrival and spread since 2014. Being the Mediterranean one of the most studied basin both regarding ascidians taxonomy and introduced species, it is odd that such an invasive species could have originated here and being totally overlooked in the past. Although I agree that relationships with congeneric species in the native areas are unclear and should be revised in the future. I may also add that the low intraspecific divergence of COI gene among different localities it is not a sign of cryptogenicity, and other markers/genes should be used to investigate this issue (see Hudson et al. 2022).

Mechanism of action: Further investigation into the mechanism of action of mifepristone on cancer cells could provide a deeper understanding of how it inhibits their metastatic abilities.

As an undergraduate student reading for a journal club course, I found the pre-print well-written with clear language and thorough explanations of background information, making it an excellent introduction to cancer biology and neuroscience research methods for someone with minimal experience in the field, like myself. However, in my opinion, there are several areas in which this publication could be made more easily digestible. In figures 3 and 4, I found some in vivo data presentation choices to be unnecessarily confusing. For instance, in figures 3b and 4b, the coronal slices are in disarray, with large portions of the mouse brain missing, and the use of gray-scale nuclear stain makes it difficult to distinguish hGBM xenografts from the surrounding neural architecture; in the shFGFR1 slice of figure 3b, the xenograft appears indistinguishable from the adjacent lateral ventricle. Moreover, the identical shCo slices presented in both figures 3b and 4b lead the reader to believe that both experimental conditions, shFGFR1 and shFGFR2, were compared against the same shCo group, in which case, the data for all 3 conditions should have been statistically analyzed together and presented in the same figure for clarity. More generally, the use of plunger plots throughout this paper conceals the spread of the data set. An alternative statistical approach, such as box/whisker or violin plots, would have demonstrated the variance in the data. For example, in figure 2b, the mean fluorescence intensity of the tumor core appears to have a more skewed distribution than the invasive edge. Perhaps, this wide range of values reflects the heterogeneity of FGFR1 expression within the tumor core such that there are discrete populations of cells in the core with higher or lower FGFR1 expression. Perhaps, in future experiments, single-cell RNA sequencing with 10X Genomics could be used to identify populations with variable FGFR1 expression within the hGBM xenograft.",2023-01-30T03:30:59,,Nicole Agranonik,10.1101/2023.01.10.523434,Spatial distribution and functional relevance of FGFR1 and FGFR2 expression for glioblastoma tumor invasion,"Nawal Alshahrany, Ana Jimenez-Pascual, Florian A Siebzehnrubl",2023-01-10

You raised very good questions and critique in regards to the role of ROS and the lack of data to back that up in our paper. To our knowledge, there was already enough data published discussing ROS expression after tobacco smoking, in vivo and in vitro. We didn't want to be redundant on that topic, but I agree with you in that we didn't further search for the role of EVs and ROS together, and that is definetly something that we could explore in the future. During the reviewing process, our cohort's demographics also came up and we analysed our data to see if BMI and/or sex switched our results and found no significant or relevant findings in this regard. In our recruitment process, we made sure to only include healthy individuals who didn't have any diagnosed disorders of any kind, so that variable is as controlled as we possibly could.

There were plenty of errors both in the way we displayed the data and in our descriptions too, and we hope that all of them are now fixed in the final version. One of these errors was definitely the description of the statistical tests used. As you correctly noticed, throughout the paper we incorrectly use ""non-parametric t-test"" when we aimed to state that non-parametric U-test for independent samples was used. When we compared dependent samples, we performed Wilconxon matched-pairs rank tests as you also rightfully suggested.

Thank you for sharing your search parameters for xiSEARCH and as a developer of that tool I second your choice of parameters completely. However, to answer the question “STY or not STY?” your current search experiment seems insufficient to us for reasons detailed below, and we would like to suggest a number of controls and changes. When allowing either KSTY or KGVL you disregard an important element of link assignment based on the often-incomplete MS data. Indeed, the MS2 data often do not unambiguously assign the linked residue by neighbouring backbone fragments and the likely link site is chosen based on the predefined chemistry of the linker. Fig 2G is a nice example of this. Depending on what you define as chemical preference of the crosslinker, you either report S or G. In all those cases, any residue is equally likely based on the MS data and your linker definition determines the reported site. If STY are disregarded and the abundant GVL are pre-defined, obviously, they will be reported. To put this to an extreme, why do you not disregard K as a link possibility and only allow GVL? We would like to suggest a couple of changes to your experiment: (1) To determine if STY are targets of NHS crosslinkers, only evaluate sites that were reported unambiguously based on MS data, i.e, with neighbouring fragments. Maybe run a completely indiscriminate crosslinker and look for enriched amino acids. Open modification search analyses linear peptides which differ from crosslinked peptides in not having a second reaction step in a spatially confined setting. The first reaction of a crosslinker brings it into the protein, the second reaction takes place with a spatially proximal residue of appropriate chemistry. The second step can only be assessed by looking into crosslinked peptides. (2) To determine if the data support STY as well or as poorly as the chemically meaningless GVL, define a linker KSTYGVL to let STY and GVL compete. Note that xiSEARCH currently will take the more C-terminal residue in any ambiguity window and thus have some random component in link site assignment. If an ambiguity window contains a K near STY, xiSEARCH has a preference setting for K, though. Consequently, if a STY is reported in favour of a nearby K, there must be supporting MS2 evidence in the spectrum for this report. (3) Do the GVL linker experiment (no KSTY). I would expect you to find many crosslinked peptides, nearly all the same peptide pairs as with K or KSTY. (4) Do KYST versus KGVL and match the YST with the GVL peptides where the are the identical peptide matches and compare the score. Plot a 2D scatter plot with score(YST) versus score(GVL). My expectation is that you will have many equal scoring peptides (ambiguity window based on insufficient MS2 data) and many cases where the score(YST) will be larger. As a final note, link site assignment is currently an open issue of crosslinking, and you are right to point this out. Curiously, speaking to Jan Kosinski as a modeller, he did not care about link sites at all. Our own work on using photo-crosslinking (where link site assignment is even more problematic because of the wider reactivity) did not show difference in protein structure model quality using link sites with a +/- 5 residue scatter (PMID: 26385339). So far, it seems to be unclear if link site precision offers any structural value. I hope it does… albeit it might not, considering the length of NHS crosslinkers and the flexibility of proteins. From a mass spectrometry side, I would, nonetheless, prefer to see link sites reported with a measure of precision.",2023-01-26T09:44:19,jurirappsilber,Juri Rappsilber,10.1101/2023.01.17.524485,Comparative analysis of chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry data indicates that protein STY residues rarely react with N-hydroxysuccinimide ester cross-linkers,"Yong Cao, Xin-Tong Liu, Peng-Zhi Mao, Ching Tarn, Meng-Qiu Dong",2023-01-18

I have some results with AF benchmarked against ANIm, but not very polished. I don't know how to share images here so I have e-mailed some rough graphs to you. The ANIu I am using has some weird AF results. It has very non-linear behavior with respect to ANIm. FastANI, skani are much more concordant with each other and ANIm. skani seems to approximate AF relatively well, but there is a noticeable underestimation that occurs with default parameters. The AF is underestimated consistently by approximate 5% (75 AF -> 70 AF). This bias decreases as you decrease the ""c"" parameter. -c set to 60 works quite well if you care about AF a lot.

Himes “A robust normalized local filter to estimate occupancy directly from cryo-EM maps.” The version posted January 20, 2023, to biorxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/202.... The problem being investigated: The interpretation and utility of cryo-EM reconstructions [maps hereafter] is often made challenging by spatially localized degradation that may arise from several sources. To this end, many tools exist to estimate and/or modulate cryo-EM maps non-uniformly. These tools are generally sensitive to artifacts in the cryo-EM maps, user-selected processing parameters like the local window size, and image intensity distributions that deviate from those generated by well-isolated globular proteins. The proposed solution: Forsberg, Shah, and Burt propose a non-linear filter based on the maximal value in a sliding window. While existing tools lean toward estimating local resolution or signal-to-noise ratios, the authors aim to avoid problems this may introduce by starting from the premise that the real-space image intensities should be relatively uniform at moderate-to-low resolution unless there is flexibility or compositional heterogeneity. By starting from this simple premise and selecting the max-value filter, the method aims to be robust as well as fast The results: The filter is implemented in Python. The authors have developed a clean and well-designed GUI that is easy to install, intuitive to use, well-documented, and interfaces beautifully with a USCF-Chimerx, a staple visualization tool in the field. The manuscript is well written, and the results clearly show they can measure non-uniformity in real-space cryo-EM maps. Beyond visualization, they demonstrate that this statistic can also be used to modify the cryo-EM map; however, the full utility of such modifications is somewhat less convincing. That is, of course, no concern, as the improved visualization should already be beneficial in cryo-EM map interpretation. Major concerns: None Minor concerns: 1.     Several minor phrasing issues result in statements that could be understood as factually incorrect if read out of context—these I’ve sent to the authors directly. 2.     “So-called ab-initio 3D reconstructions can now be made without user input bias.” It is worth noting that template-based particle picking or even blob-based picking combined with 2d classification can introduce model bias that persists even when ab-initio 3D reconstruction is used. Even the selection of 2D classes can introduce model bias from the users mental model of the target. See for example, Superstitious Perceptions Reveal Properties of Internal Representations, Gosselin and Schyns 2003 Psychological Science. 3.     Resolution in cryo-EM is not a contested term. It is the spatial frequency at which the reconstruction is no longer statistically reliable. The definition of where exactly that point is, however, has been contested in the past. 4.     A few relative qualifiers should be specific—Eg. “reasonably sized input”, “…reasonably set lower…” etc. 5.     In the methods section, the authors point out that the CDF in eq 6 is only valid for statistically independent voxels. While it is often the case that these conditions can be relaxed, I think it is reasonable to ask for an analysis of or justification for using this CDF, given that the core problem the authors address is one that, by definition, results from statistical dependence between pixels. As a simple example, consider a loop flipping back and forth between two positions, resulting in lower average occupancy. At any given time, the intensity measured in one of those positions is correlated with the intensity in the other. 6.     The value of 449’260 CPU seconds in table S1 seems unreasonably high. Are these measurements the average of several repeated experiments? Please double-check. Final thoughts: The authors have presented an algorithm that is robust to common characteristics in cryo-EM maps and developed a tool to execute that algorithm that is easy to use and open to modify. Well done! I could install this and immediately use it in a project I was working on.",2023-01-23T14:56:20,benjamin_himes,Benjamin Himes,10.1101/2023.01.18.524529,A robust normalized local filter to estimate occupancy directly from cryo-EM maps,"Bjoern O.

In the future, I will be using this approach for all of my large knock-in CRISPR experiments. In my hands, CRISPR using a ssDNA repair template for a large insertion (~1Kbp, GFP) was 30% more efficient than the corresponding dsDNA template. The protocol described in the supplemental methods was thorough and easy to follow. I appreciated the comments that added extra context. Using a single phosphorylated primer and lambda-exonuclease to generate the ssDNA template from a PCR product was simple and only added an extra hour or so to my usual protocol. The enzyme was cheap enough (~€70) and will be sufficient for 100s of reactions. The phosphorylated primer was about 5x more expensive than a standard primer but I think this added cost is worth the increase in efficiency.

But based on the data presented in this preprint, can the authors really conclude that Nr5a2 protein is not required for zygotic genome activation (ZGA)? The detection of Nr5a2 protein by immunofluorescence is technically challenging. For this reason, and because Nr5a2 is maternally provided (Gassler et al., Science 2022), can the authors rule out that Nr5a2 knockout zygotes still contain maternally provided Nr5a2 protein, which is sufficient for ZGA? We recommend using our optimized protocol, with which maternally provided Nr5a2 protein can be detected in oocytes, zygotes and 2-cell embryos (Gassler et al., Science 2022) to quantify how much Nr5a2 protein is left in conditional Nr5a2 knockout embryos.

The LINCS dataset, which includes official access instructions, is detailed in our recent paper (DOI: 10.1016/j.cels.2022.10.001) 3. We include level 3 data in that resource, but I'd advise strongly against using level 3 data. They contain unnormalized CellProfiler features that are incompatible with standard distance metrics. My assumption is that a like-to-like comparison is more suited if the full standard approaches are compared (i.e. I don't think people use the level 3 data all that often, so benchmarking against it is less valuable). I think MOAProfiler is likely to still outperform, but at a lower margin. 4. I agree that testing the generalizability is a very exciting application. I think that for my lab to use MOAProfiler, I would need to see this trade-off. Thanks again!

The observation that success and selection point to the same features is reassuring. It suggests that this population is not walking into an ecological trap, which a very interesting point. One problem with the work, though, is that an undisclosed proportion of the cavity-feature data was imputed (i.e. not actually measured in the field but inferred after the fact based on the distribution of measurements that were made - see section 2.5 of ms). Imputation may be a reasonable approach if it applies to a small enough proportion of the data.

They use this strain to quantify the number of neurons in the major sensory appendages using an existing QUAS-CD8:GFP reporter strain. The images in the paper are beautiful and the cell counts are a valuable resource for the field. No one has attempted to do cell counts like this before, and this reagent made this possible. A few suggestions to improve the paper: 1)	The authors have not formally shown that the brp-QF2w line is in fact pan neuronal. It would require significant additional work to prove this, e.g. double label antibody staining with RNA in situ hybridization against a pan-neuronal gene to show a 1:1 correspondence. I do not suggest that they do this, but it’s important to note the caveat early in the paper that the genetic reagent is assumed to be pan neuronal because the targeted locus is a neuronal gene. 2)	Speculation on phenotypic/behavioral variability caused by variation in cell number (Line 283-299) seems premature to me. It could be variation in the expression of the driver or reporter, rather than underlying variation in the number of chemosensory neurons. More experiments would need to be done to confirm that what is seen with the genetic reagents reflects actual biological variability. I might suggest that this paragraph be toned down or removed. 3)	Figure 2E-F, Figure 3E: could the authors clarify how the data are plotted and what the sample sizes are. I have the impression that the small dots are individual experiments, but it is not clear. For transparency, it might be best to not use bar plots and instead use dot plots where all of the data points are clearly visible.

Compare for example with the cryo-EM densities of apoferritin at 1.22 Å resolution (EMD-11638), apoferritin at 1.15 Å (EMD-11668), or even the maps of Beta-gal at 1.9 Å (EMD-0153 and EMD-7770). The zoomed-in densities for aminoacids presented in Figures 2d and 3a,d seem to be missing features. --While the half-map FSC extends all the way to Nyquist at a high correlation (~0.3), it starts decreasing quite early, which looks suspicious for an allegedly very high quality map.

Thanks for reviewing the preprint — it will definitely help to make the manuscript better and improve the science. For the minor comments, I will go through them individually and make changes as necessary to the paper before its official publication. For the major comments: - The repo will be made public soon depending on how quickly Pfizer’s IP department can review and approve it — apologies for the delays. - For the CP embeddings, we actually derived from two sources as described in Methods: - JUMP Pilot: We downloaded from the repo https://github.com/jump-cel.... To our understanding, this repo was created by the same people who made the JUMP Pilot dataset, and they provided the source and instructions for downloading the CP embeddings used in their study here: https://www.biorxiv.org/con.... If you have another source for embeddings, I’m happy to analyze them! - LINCS: We downloaded them from the repo: https://github.com/broadins.... To our understanding, this repo was created by one of the main developers and maintainers of DeepProfiler for use in benchmarking DeepProfiler against CellProfiler, so we thought that it was satisfactory but we could be mistaken! As with the JUMP Pilot, if there is a better source for embeddings, I’m also happy to analyze them if you can provide a CSV. - We purposefully chose level 3 (un-normalized) embeddings because the MP profiles are also un-normalized and we wanted to compare like to like. MP's embeddings are pulled directly from the model's hidden state without any post-processing or plate / DMSO normalization. Hence if there are better embedding sources, it would be helpful if you could provide level 3 ones. - We did not try combining datasets — that’s part of a potential future work which I anticipate would boost performance as we expose the model to more diversity. Although interesting, we saw this as out of scope for supporting the main claims of the paper. For this paper at least, we did not do a cross analysis (i.e. Model trained on A but evaluated on Dataset B). It might be an interesting supplemental analysis, but we thought that prediction on held-out compounds was sufficient to prove the point we were trying to make. Strong model generalizability to other datasets instead of generalizability to new compounds (as in the current study) will be left as a future (and very exciting!) exercise. Thanks for taking the time to review and help improve the work. I admire what your group is doing for advancing open science!

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.15.516561v2#comment-6082735151,biorxivstage,3,"Wong et al. present a deep learning approach called MOAProfiler (MP) to specifically predict compound mechanism of action (MOA) from Cell Painting images. They benchmark MP against CellProfiler (the standard image-based profiling approach) and DeepProfiler (an emerging image-based profiling approach also based on deep learning) using two publicly-available datasets (JUMP-pilot and LINCS). They evaluate these approaches using precision, recall, and f1 score at k for held out MOA predictions and by comparing similarity between same-MOA and different-MOA profiles. They report an astounding 1,000% performance increase for MP over CellProfiler and DeepProfiler in grouping like MOAs. We thank the authors for posting their work as a preprint - thank you! The primary innovation in MP is the specific training approach. MP uses the same architectural backbone as DeepProfiler (EfficientNet), but trains the model directly to predict compound MOA (instead, DeepProfiler uses EfficientNet to derive representations). Additionally, MP does not perform single-cell segmentation, instead training using full field of views and a series of data augmentations. The authors use the last layer as the per-compound feature embedding in their performance benchmarks. The authors also include several convincing supplementary analyses that further support their claims. Overall, the paper presents a very interesting observation and pushes against a commonly held mindset of analyzing Cell Painting data with generalist/universal approaches. Instead, the paper suggests that fine-tuned models for specific applications are vastly superior for specifically tailored tasks. However, we have two major concerns and several relatively minor comments that the authors might clarify in order to strengthen their findings and claims. Major concerns: - Our primary concern involves publicly-available resources. Namely, the github url is not public: https://github.com/pfizer-r.... Because we were unable to access the code, we were not able to perform a detailed code review. Additionally, the authors link to the CellProfiler and DeepProfiler embeddings they used to benchmark. These embeddings were derived from https://github.com/broadins.... These are not the official LINCS and JUMP resources, and at least one of the links pointed to level 3 profiles, which are not normalized. This could at least partially explain the exceptionally poor performance for CellProfiler and DeepProfiler. - Second, the authors train two separate MP models for both datasets. Did the authors try applying a trained-MP on the alternative dataset? The authors state: “To simulate the real-world use case of identifying MOAs of unknown held-out compounds, we performed an analysis where we split the dataset by compound instead of by wells (Methods).” We imagine that analyzing future compounds using embeddings of a pre-trained MP is also a common real-world application. This analysis would also reveal the level of overfitting occurring in each independently trained dataset. Would combining datasets improve performance? Minor comments and concerns: - The authors state: “​​Although traditional computer vision techniques have proved useful, they often require much fine-tuning and require human intelligence and intuition for deciding which phenotypic features and their parameters are important to measure.” We think this is a really good point, and we are glad someone else brought up the parameters and all the fine-tuning that typically needs to happen, even for generalist approaches. - The authors state: “In contrast, deep learning has emerged as a tool for learning and encoding meaningful representations (i.e. embeddings) without requiring humans to know beforehand what features may be useful for the task of interest.” We may have missed this, but the authors might decide to mention the deep learning limitation of having unlabeled and difficult-to-interpret features. - Figure 1B needs a scale bar - The authors state: “We divided the dataset such that 60% of the wells were assigned to training, 10% to validation, and 30% to test (Methods).” What does “class-balanced the training set” mean? Is this during cross validation? The authors should clarify. - The authors state: “We also ensured each MOA’s test wells spanned multiple plates (at least seven, Figure 2D, left)”. However, Figure 2D shows that most MOAs in LINCS spanned fewer than 7 plates, what did the authors do with those? - The authors state: “We also included the negative DMSO as a class to learn but excluded it from all performance metrics because of its overrepresentation in the dataset”. It would be helpful for the authors to clarify how they handled positive controls. Also related, the authors state: “we performed four analyses to assess how well the embeddings captured MOA-specific features.” How did DMSO perform? It would be interesting to see the distribution of DMSO probabilities across classes, which could point to classes with no effect or how often DMSO features might be influenced by batch effects. - For Figure 3A, the authors should clarify that their supervised learning architecture was multi-class. This is not explicitly stated. - The authors state: “On the held-out test set, the model achieved an area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.46 (random AUPRC = 0.006) for image field classification over 176 MOA classes (Figure 3A)”. How are the authors calculating this random AUPRC? If this is theoretical, the authors should compare performance with a model trained with a randomly shuffled baseline. - Additionally, the authors state elsewhere: “it was able to correctly predict MOAs for 10.2-13.6% of the compounds in a space of 176 possible MOAs. Compared to a random baseline of 0.6%, this is a 17.9-23.9x improvement.” This begs another question of how the authors formed the baselines. Also, why did the authors choose to not include DP and CP in this eval? - The Figure 4B plate map might be wrong. There are more DMSO and what are the NAs? - How did the authors determine the categories “strongly correlated” and “weakly correlated”? At different thresholds did MP still outperform? - The authors state: “Performance varied depending upon whether we predicted MOA by the neural network’s classification output or by a compound’s latent similarity to training compound embeddings”. The authors should clarify how they determined these classification outputs and latent similarities as they are introduced. - The authors state: “(delta = 0.44 for MP, Figure 3C). For both CP and DP, the difference was smaller (delta = 0.03 for CP, 0.03 for DP).” The authors define delta in the figure legend, but this should also be clearly delineated in the methods. - We were confused by the legend in figure 4D - why are each of the models showing a different k? Is this the optimal k? MP doesn’t look optimal at k=4. - The authors state: “From a low-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (TSNE) visualization of embeddings from three example MOAs, we could see that different compounds with the same MOA were clustered together with different MOAs inhabiting different areas in latent space (Figure 3G).” How did the authors choose these three example MOAs? Why not include all of them? It would be nice to visualize all embeddings for both datasets, and the TSNE plots look a bit strange, with highly similar distances between points. - The authors state: “However, the model created embeddings that were clustered by MOA despite each MOA being represented by multiple compounds (Supplemental Figure 1).” Supplementary Figure 1 is not a specific enough reference - there are multiple panels and it is unclear which panel the reader should focus on. - The authors state: “We found minor differences in classification accuracy (0.54 vs .50) suggesting that the model was not leveraging much confounding edge-specific features for its learning” Given the number of NA’s (especially in LINCS platemap in Figure 4), normalization to remove batch effects or TSNE/UMAP to suggest no batch effects would be more convincing. - Figure 6G mentions different shapes in the legend but all look like circles in the image (they are different but it's very hard to tell). The authors also forgot to include the letter g in the figure legend. - Does supplementary figure 3 show MP embeddings? This is not explicitly stated. - Performance across MOA counts for MP is impressive! Very strong performance at low n - In the discussion, the authors state: “Second, all the analyses were performed on compounds with just one known MOA. Understanding drugs that are associated with multiple MOAs is an important task, but our study did not address this question.” The authors seem to avoid explaining this in-depth throughout the article. Why is it an important task and is their justification for not including drugs with multiple MOAs good enough? They mention that they didn’t include compounds with multiple MOAs to simplify the compound space and limit polypharmacology intricacies. Did they try to include compounds with multiple MOAs? If so, I think they should report the results. If the results are bad, then that could give insight into how we can improve performance. - In the discussion, the authors state: “Although DP is another deep learning based approach to phenotypic profiling that also uses an EfficientNet backbone architecture, we observed larger performance gains with MP.” What was the authors’ rationale for using EfficientNet? Also, “architecture” here and in other sentences appears to have a broad meaning. Could another word be substituted for greater specificity? We think it would be helpful to include a diagram of their model architecture. - The authors state: “We permuted each channel’s brightness and contrast independently by a random factor in the range of 0 to 0.30 (just for the LINCS dataset).” This seems non-traditional, the authors should provide a citation. Why not perform this in the JUMP dataset? - The authors state: “As a final training augmentation step, we performed random 90-degree rotations on each image, along with random horizontal flips.” The authors should specify how many augmentations they performed, how did this expand the dataset, were any specific augmentations particularly helpful? - The authors state: “We kept only the compound data that had no more than one known MOA according to the CLUE Connectivity Map…” How often does compound data have more than one MOA from the CLUE Connectivity Map? Would it create a significant difference in results if others were included? How was CLUE connectivity data joined with or used as a filter for JUMP1? - The authors state: “We trained for 100 epochs and selected the model that had the highest accuracy on the validation set. We used a learning rate of 0.1, a weight decay of 0.0001, a dropout rate of 0.2, a learning momentum of 0.9, a learning rate scheduler with a gamma decay of 0.1 at epoch 50 and 75, and batch size of 56 for training.” Did the authors perform any sort of hyperparameter optimization? How did they select these hyperparameters? - For their CellProfiler pipelines, the authors do not explain why they used specific modules. The pipeline utilizes various different modules that I haven’t seen in other pipelines so it would help to know what is being done if there were notes. Reviewed by: Gregory P.
