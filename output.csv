What we show in Figure 5 are neither the number of genes nor the number of proteins, but the number of different mRNA transcript contigs. You are correct that this number is not the same as the gene number, and that's why the categories of the x-axis are not written in italics. However, this number strongly correlates with the gene number (the more genes, the more distinct transcripts). We are having a look at this issue at the moment and we might replace the mRNA transcript contig number by the gene number. However, that requires us to go through them one-by-one and identify those that are splice isoforms originating from one-and-the-same gene. If you know a script that can do this decision for us, please let me know; otherwise it's a painstaking job.",2022-09-23T17:21:43,JeltschM,Michael Jeltsch,10.1101/2022.09.19.507521,Expansion and collapse of VEGF diversity in major clades of the animal kingdom,"Khushbu Rauniyar, Honey Bokharaie, Michael Jeltsch",2022-09-19

Nevertheless, I have a technical issue with this manuscript: The number of mRNA transcripts contigs that you show for the different genes in Figure 5 are not well defined. You forget that genes can produce several transcripts by the process of alternative splicing. Therefore labeling the x-axis with the gene names is a bit misleading.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.31.502182v1#comment-5993461141,biorxivstage,1,"The question of how information is stored in neuronal ensembles during learning and memory has recently become accessible with IEG tagging approaches. How precisely tagged ensembles relate to the engram, or memory trace, is still not clear. Another important question is how do tagged ensembles mature or change over time and what is the precise engram that is required for remote memory recall. This preprint shows strong data supporting the idea of overlapping, but distinct ensembles involved in recent and remote memories. The authors show that tagged ensembles change their network connectivity over time, using innovative viral tracing techniques. For example, dCA1 neurons that project to the ACC are more likely to be engram cells at remote recall than recent recall timepoints, and fewer ACC to dCA1 cells are active at remote recall compared to recent recall time points. We think there are some additions that could be made to improve the conclusions and data presentation: 1.Showing individual data-points for all bar graphs would improve the interpretability of the data throughout the paper. We also noticed that in some experiments, the N values for controls vs manipulated/activated animals is vastly different (eg Fig. 4). 2. Include individual statistical tests in each figure/panel. 3.The authors quantify the overlap of engrams tagged at different time points by calculating the overlap compared to expected overlap. While this is useful to show that Fos-tagged ensembles are not random, we believe it is important to also include the absolute percentage of overlapping cells to determine the similarity of engrams. It appears from the IHC images that the absolute overlap is a low percentage of the total number of neurons tagged as engram cells at any particular timepoint. This should also include the total % of Fos-tagged cells in each experiment. Since the total % would greatly alter the expected value by chance. Indeed, in many cases it seems that there is less than the expected chance value indicating that ensembles are not activated randomly but may be distinct. 4. We appreciate the design of the first set of functional experiments where 4-OHT is administered during recall (Fig 1K). This approach shows that the same cells active in the recent recall engram are those inhibited by CNO a month later at the remote test. To take this experiment one step further, one could add a group where 4-OHT treatment is administered 2 days post-acquisition without a recall test, or with a recall test in a different context, and evaluation of fear conditioning at the remote time-point. This would be a convincing way to show that CNO is not simply inhibiting enough neurons to block the remote memory, but rather that it is the activity of those specific neurons in the original recall engram which are necessary for remote recall.

The notion of optimal coding is a further speculation: the mossy fiber - granule cell pathway is anatomically relevant to favor the implementation of internal models within the system, as MFs are sending redundant projections to send information to various locations of the cerebellar cortex. To date, there's no evidence suggesting that MF-GC projections are re-routed within the lifetime of an animal (plasticity may occur, however hard wiring is genetically driven) and therefore I see the MF system as an invariant frame. On the other hand, we have evidence that most of GC-PC synapses are silent, and Purkinje cells select relevant GC synapses based on activity. Ultimately, information can be adaptively routed within the system but it cannot override or outbound the anatomical constraint of the MF-GC pathway. There comes the question of ""how dense should be the GC-PC connectivity to allow the best performance"".

Peidli et al. present a data resource (for single-cell perturbations) and apply energy distance (e-distance) to quantify differences in perturbations. For the data resource, the authors focus on curating single-cell RNAseq and ATACseq measurements perturbed with CRISPR, drug treatments, and a few other perturbation types. The authors curate a total of 44 datasets. Overall, the paper is very well written with a sound logical flow. However, many elements of the paper seem incomplete. We provide several specific comments regarding our views on how the paper could improve. We thank the authors for posting their preprint and code publicly. Our two primary comments are: 1. The data are not harmonized from reads. Instead, the authors process (in most cases) already processed read count by gene matrices. The authors also use different versions of scanpy to process different datasets. This is definitely still valuable, but the authors should state these facts earlier and probably decrease the use of “harmonization”. Additionally, there is no evaluation to determine the effect or benefit of this read count harmonization. Calculating e-distance before and after harmonization across datasets might be helpful. 2. E-distance is not sufficiently benchmarked. The math and intuition are described marvelously, but how does E-distance behave across datasets and common perturbations? How does subsampling read depth impact E-distance calculations? How does drug dose impact e-distance? How does sequencing technology impact e-distance? How does modifying the distance metric within the E-distance calculation impact calculations? We also have several general comments on different aspects of the paper and github repository. We hope that the authors can benefit from our deep dive on the paper. Thanks again! Introduction - Definition of single-cell perturbation data (SCPD) Overall, this subsection is more of a “methods/techniques overview” of how to collect SCPD rather than defining what SCPD actually is. What is output from these techniques? - The authors should define these data in more detail. - The authors should also further define the techniques as it is helpful to have a general idea of why the data collected from the techniques are “good” and not just “more data are better”. Motivation for distance measure of high-dimensional profiles: - The authors claim that E-distance can identify strong or weak perturbations. It’s unclear what a strong or weak perturbation is. I was unable to find this information from a quick google search so I think they should define that here (not found in methods either). Motivation for unifying datasets - Their motivation only seems to be “it doesn’t exist yet because it’s difficult to do” so therefore we should do it. What will/could come of the integrated and standardized datasets? What would we hope to find? Web Interface - The authors claim, “a web interface for data access, analysis and visualization is available at scperturb.org.” There is data access on that site, but analysis and visualization appear to be absent using Brave and Safari browsers. - It seems that one would require a computer with enough memory (500G) to run scPerturb to reproduce the analysis. The authors present solutions for how to overcome these requirements, but it did not seem that they attempted to solve them. - The authors state that there are Quality Control plots for each dataset on the website but we could not find. Results - The authors should briefly describe the methods underlying the statement “dense low-dimensional embeddings of the original data (see Methods for details)” in a bit more detail upon introduction. - It is surprising to me that there are so many cells with 2 perturbations (proportionally to a single perturbation) (sup fig 1). Is this because of an overweighting of a specific study? - It might be helpful to add targeted sequencing depth to table 1 per study, also helpful to add the sequencing platforms used. - Data source trust: Zenodo sources appear to be auxiliary data downloads as opposed to direct sources. How might other researchers assume trust in the sources? Are the included metadata implied or entrusted to the authors? - Are the UMAPs in Figure 3E the same UMAP space or are the spaces fit independently in both panels? - Need to provide a bit more rationale for why the authors chose E-distance over the other options. - Did they calculate E-distance for all perturbations? Sup Fig 3 shows this, so maybe? It was not obvious where to find the measurements. - There are only 11 drug perturbations in common. This is a very interesting observation! How many genes are perturbed in common datasets? Methods - For the scATAC-Seq data, it’s not clear to me if they perform LSI jointly across all samples or not. This would cause non-interoperability across datasets if not done jointly since each LSI dimension may mean something different in each dataset. In addition, they provide peaks x counts matrix -- which is dataset specific. I would suggest aligning jointly using a uniform set of peaks -- Running MACS2 on all datasets would be a huge benefit to the community. - How do the different versions of scanpy impact data processing? Typically, harmonized data are generated with a single pipeline. - When performing subsampling to fit PCA, did the authors transform the full data subsequently? In other words, does the PCA fitting step impact cell count for e-distance calculation? - What distance measure is used in the E-distance calculation for ||x_i - x_J||? L2? For perturbations, comparing L2 to other metrics would help benchmark the method. Code/Github - It seems to us a good idea to spend time improving the existing model / code at https://github.com/theislab.... The authors should justify why they are not contributing to existing open source code. - I can’t find the script “fragments2outputs.R” in their github. From their paper: “All features described in the overview above were computed with ArchR functions. For details inspect the “fragments2outputs.R” script in our code repository (see Data Availability).” Data Repo comments: - Manual data testing for reproducibility within https://github.com/sanderla... (one must perform the steps, the repo doesn’t provide or outline within the code itself) - Suggests using “mamba” but does not provide instructions on how to install mamba - Would suggest a small description for each folder in the directory (README) explaining its contents - There’s no usage example on how to download the data or use the program - Would  be best to have a notebook (or bash script) that describes the entire workflow. - The notebooks are not sequentially executed and there are no execution instructions - What environment (OS/hardware/configuration/etc) is required to run the code? - Is notebook (.ipynb) output expected within committed code? (should these have been scrubbed with nbconvert/jupytext?) Data Availability - Based on this section, their website only contains the first three bullet points (e.g scRNA-seq data, scATAC-seq data, and details about the datasets). We could not easily find the last three bullet points (Quality control plots for each dataset, Filtering, e.g., by readout or type of perturbation, Commands for direct file download using the Unix command curl) This review was produced jointly at The University of Colorado by: Gregory P.

The purpose of the current release is merely to describe the deep learning approach and we feel that information provided is sufficient for qualified researchers to recapitulate the computational strategies. While reporting repellency in terms of protection, e.g. complete protection time, would indeed be appropriate in the context of acquiring data for registering and labeling of repellent products (per EPA & WHO guidelines), we recognise the added complexity of such studies. The complete protection time of a specific repellent can (partially) be tuned using traditional and more advanced formulations, e.g. by influencing speed of release and rate of absorption by the skin. We, therefore, think that the potency of the repellents (e.g. expressed as ED50) would be a more suitable metric at the stage of compound discovery, and complete protection time is a more suitable metric in a product development stage. We agree that a good repellent should provide approximately 100% protection from mosquito bites for several hours, in the context of topically applied repellents (typically 300-400 ug/cm2). Please note that we tested compounds at very low densities (25 ug/cm2 and 13 ug/cm2 in our membrane feeding assay and arm-by-cage assay, respectively) in order to be able to pick up responses that outperform current gold standard repellents (DEET and picaridin). As exemplified in Figure 2E the percentage protection goes up with increasing dose, and the exact nature of this dose-response relationship is the focus of our current studies. Indeed, IP considerations prevent us from releasing more data on the nature of the novel molecules that were discovered but we hope to do so with publication in a peer-reviewed journal in due time. Thanks for spotting the erroneous statements with respect to picaridin and ORs, we will correct them in a new version on BioRxiv.

Also, you also state that the sequence length is fixed at thirteen residues. In part A of the results, you mention that an advantage of BO is that the sequence length can change during optimization.

The comments were synthesized by Iratxe Puebla. The study reports two two Bcl-2 family proteins, BNIP5 and Bcl-G, which inhibit Bak-dependent apoptosis through engagement of MODE 2 inhibition. The BH3 domains of these proteins act as selective Bak activators, while not inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins, leading to increased binding of activated Bak to Mcl-1, which prevents apoptosis. The reviewers raised a couple of questions about the methodology and several other suggestions for the paper, outlined below: Methodology Throughout the study various BH3 mimetics are used, but the combinations in which they are used and/or the doses employed could be more clearly reported. For example, in Figure 1E and 1F ABT-737 and S63845 are used at 1 μM.  Then, in Figure 1H, A-331852 is substituted for ABT-737 in combination with S63845 and the concentration is not reported. In Figure 1H, ABT-737 and S63845 are used again, but this time at a concentration of 2 μM each. Other concentrations are used  in Figures 2, 3, and 5.  There seems to be a dose-response assay in Figure 3B, but it is used for a specific use case. It would be beneficial to report all combinations and doses employed, and the rationale for them in the main text, to allow readers to fully interpret the data presented. In various figures, there is a concern about the statistical approach to calculate p-values based on multiple measurements or cells within each sample. The t-test and ANOVA assume that each measurement is independent, and multiple nuclei within the same sample are not independent. Recommend either not reporting p-values or averaging together the values from each biological replicate to calculate the p-value using those sample-level means. For more information, see https://doi.org/10.1371/jou... and https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb... Specific comments Introduction ‘ The two MOMP effectors Bcl-2 associated x (Bax) and Bcl-2 antagonist killer (Bak) are inactive in resting cells as these cells exhibit low levels of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (e.g. BIM)....and some are additionally able to activate Bax and Bak (sensitizers and direct activators, e.g. BIM)’ - Recommend revising the fragment for clarity, adding references to support the statements and possibly an introductory figure to help visualize the proteins involved. Introduction, last paragraph ‘ We found that two Bcl-2 proteins, Bcl-2 interacting protein 5 (BNIP5) and Bcl-G, act as selective inhibitors of Bak-dependent but not Bax-dependent apoptosis…’ - The fragment is unclear, BNIP5 and Bcl-G are first reported as Bak-inhibitors, then activators and back to inhibitors. Does this mean to describe protein-protein interaction and changes in conformation? Figure 1 - Recommend using a different color scheme for Figure 1E to assist visual interpretation of the results, in particular consider using a color-blind friendly color palette. - ‘ colony formation (F)’ - The text later on refers to ‘clonogenic survival’, would it be possible to clarify in the legend or text what is being assessed, i.e. recovery assay, clonogenic survival or colony formation? - Figure 1G - Please clarify whether 2 uM of each are used in this experiment. - ‘ We transduced PC9 lung cancer or A375 melanoma cells…’ - It is nice to see that different cell lines were assessed to address any cell line-specific effects. Would be interesting to see if this effect occurs in normal cell lines and not just cancer cell lines. Figure 2 -  The inline color-coded legends are useful when bars are displayed but in the figure several bars are close to zero, consider an alternative method to label the bars. Results ‘...suggesting posttranscriptional regulation of Bak levels by BNIP5 ’ - Maybe large proteome databases of multiple cell lines (e.g CCLE) can be datamined to determine the correlation between BNIP and Bak expression? Figure 3B, 3D and 3E - Please clarify the concentrations used for each treatment in the figure legend. Methods, Cell viability and cell death measurements - The study assessed cell death or cell viability with either live cell imaging, or in fixed cells, can the methodology for this be elaborated upon? Also, propidium iodide staining is used in several sections of the results, recommend adding information about this under the Methods section.

The comments were synthesized by Richa Arya. The reviewers like the motivation behind the study as a lot is still unknown about the impact of fluorescent tags on various mechanisms in biology. The work is impactful. However we outline below some major questions and several minor points: 1.	Related to the data analysis: The findings are valuable however the analyses may not be sufficiently sensitive to pick up morphological changes. Maybe other more sensitive approaches for measuring interference in the biology of these neurons could also be tested, like bulk growth rates, a stimulus added to the culture medium or other? Some of the phenotypes (see Figure 1D and Figure 3D) are relatively subtle and the manuscript relies heavily on statistics to support the claims. Independent of the statistics, the differences are not striking by eye examination. Perhaps more data is necessary to bolster some of the reported claims. As continuation to the expression analysis, it is important to estimate the expression levels of the actin binding probes used, in order to rule out the fact that some of the observed differences between LifeACT-GFP and AC-GFP may be due to discrepancies in the extent of overexpression of these probes. It would greatly add to the study to include, at least for some of the phenotypes, whether the measured parameters respond to the low versus high expression levels of the same probe. 2.	Related to the transient expression: Figure 1: The transient expression method used in the manuscript shows a lot of variability in expression levels, between cells, and between replicates. Expression levels could confound the interpretation. One of the constructs could be expressed more or less than the other, resulting in stronger or weaker phenotypes, not because it is more or less toxic than the other per se but because its expression level is different. It would be relevant to ""normalize"" for the expression level of each construct. Another way to circumvent this, at least partially, would be to substantially increase the number of cells analyzed, which would allow for a range of expression values to be represented in the data. 3. 	Related to FRAP analysis Last paragraph result 1:  ‘ and depends only on their affinity to F-actin, that is similar in AC-GFP and LifeAct-GFP (Figure 1A, Figure 1B, Supplementary Video 1). In addition, our results suggest that even without photomanipulation, minor changes in actin reorganization cannot be revealed when using actin-binding probes… ’ - Based on the images reported, it is not possible to establish how much of the signal is due to the population of probes being bound to actin versus the population that is free floating in the cytoplasm. The recovery could be due to the diffusion of free-floating probes and therefore give no information about affinity for actin. EGFP alone was used as a baseline for cytoplasmic diffusion, the slower recovery from the EGFP-actin implies that some portion of the EGFP-actin is incorporated in filaments. Recommend replacing  ""Affinity"" with ""relative ability to incorporate into filaments.""  A possibility to address the issue of size-based diffusion in cytoplasm is to complete FRAP measurements in latrunculin-treated cells that depolymerize most of the actin filaments. This will enable to set a baseline for each of the probes here (which will now probably be either free or G-actin bound) and provide a complement to the Jasplakinolide treatment. ‘ In addition, our results suggest that even without photomanipulation, minor changes in actin reorganization cannot be revealed when using actin-binding probes. ’ - There has been only two actin binding probes tested, both with similar turnover as measured in FRAP in their own assay. It might be worth making a comparison in this experiment with a very strong actin binding probe as control, such as Utrophin. 4. 	Figure 2: Theat measurement shown is not a very good proxy for filopodia motility. The study used an intensity-weighted center of mass. This means that the center of mass moves, not only because the shape of the filopodia changes but also because the signal intensity changes. In other words, the shape of a filopodia could be constant (no motility) and yet have a center of mass that moves because the mCherry signal fluctuates inside it. This could be avoided if the center of mass of the shape is used, not weighed by intensity.  This is especially a concern because the signal from the cytoplasmic mCherry is used for the analysis. If a folipodia locally thickens in the Z-direction, the cytoplasmic signal will increase locally, displacing the intensity weighted center of mass even if the 2D contour has not changed. Using a membrane signal would provide a better alternative. It would also be possible to make use of the resource Filotracker, that tracks the length of the filopodia as a measure of filopodia dynamics. Find the paper and the resource here: https://www.molbiolcell.org... 5. 	Result 2 last para, ‘ We found no significant difference in center of mass displacement between actin probe expressing cells and EGFP expressing control filopodia (Figure 2B)… ’. This section needs more clarity and evidence to conclude that the probes do not alter filopodia dynamics. Maybe filopodia growth rate or some additional measurements? Failing to find significance does not equate to finding evidence of absence. It may be that this one parameter is not sufficiently sensitive. Maybe this possible uncertainty should be discussed in the last sentence of the paragraph, to note that the data highlights the possibility that the tested actin labeling proteins do not interfere. Minor Comments Introduction: ‘Actin is a key cytoskeletal element in mammalian cells involved in many cellular mechanisms ’. mammalian cells can be replaced with eukaryotic cells. It would also be nice to mention some of the cellular mechanisms involved such as cell division, and migration, among others. Introduction: it would be good to describe the various phenotypes observed in previous studies when actin was labeled or when actin-binding proteins were used. It would give readers context about the level of toxicity and what phenotypes to expect. Introduction last paragraph: ‘…and to exclude certain actin structures from labeling (Munsie et al., 2009)’ : one more reference could be added for this statement: Sanders et al., 2013 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go... Figure1: It would be nice to have grayscale images of the actin channel in addition to the overlay. Figure 1 B, C: For all of the FRAP recovery curves, recommend providing insets, zooming in on the first 30 to 60 sec of the recovery, as that's when most of the recovery happens. The last 120 sec of the plots show a ""flat"" plateau. Figure 1D, in the fluorescence recovery plateau %."" In addition, our results suggest that even without photo manipulation, minor changes in actin reorganization cannot be revealed when using actin-binding probes."" This claim relies on the p-values. In looking at Figure 1D, left panel, EGFP-actin (orange) dots there appears to be an outlier. Independent of the outlier, the collection of dots does not appear that different by eye, recommend providing additional data to support this claim. Result 1: ‘ In Jasplakinolide-treated neurons, as expected, we observed an almost immediate recovery of fluorescence in the EGFP expressing group, whereas the EGFP-actin signal did not recover… ’. The fact that the EGFP-actin signal did not recover is surprising. Normally not all of the actin present in the protrusion is incorporated into filaments, some of it is floating around freely. Hence, some of the signal should be recovering, even after stabilization of the actin filament, simply due to diffusion. For example, the EGFP signal recovers in presence of Jasp. due to diffusion of the free-floating probe. Recommend some discussion about the absence of recovery for the EGFP-actin. Figure 2A: ‘ Red lines show the movement track of intensity weighted center of mass.. ’. The red dots for the center of mass cluster and overlap, recommend color coding the dots so that it is clear visually what the displacement of the center of mass was and showing an overlay of the contours used for the analysis. Additionally, in the Supplementary Video 2 it looks like EGFP and EGFP-actin centers of mass are more displaced than AC-GFP or LifeAct-GFP. It would be good to clarify if this is exactly the same example as shown in the figure. Figure 2B: ‘ Average intensity-weighted center of mass displacement over 60s time periods…’ Why was only a 60 sec interval considered when there are  images up to 120 sec and the video goes until 180 sec? Additionally, please specify if these are the first 60 sec of imaging. Result 3: It is known that expression levels of actin binding probes can alter actin structures and their dynamics. It would have been great to do the following: (a) estimate the levels of expressed lifeact-GFP/AC-GFP and see how they compare with each other, (b) note or look for phenotypic differences as a function of the expression levels of these probes. It might be worth plotting the spine morphometric data in categories of low, medium and high expression levels of the two actin binding probes as well as EGFP-Actin (since this can affect nucleation/treadmilling etc at very high expression levels). Just as the identity of the actin binding probe being used is an important consideration in studies of actin dynamics, so is the expression levels of these probes. Result 3: use p-values to compare different cell lines, the n used in the statistics should be the number of samples, not the number of spines. Result 3: ‘ This is like due to the known high background fluorescence level of LifeAct, originating from its affinity to G-actin (Melak, Plessner and Grosse, 2017)… ’. Actin chromobody is also known to bind G actin. Is there a significant difference in G Actin binding affinity for LifeACT versus AC that can account for this explanation? Figure 3C ‘ Expression of EGFP-actin or LifeAct-GFP for 24 hours did not influence total protrusion density’ - Please indicate whether these morphological analyses were done blinded as to what the cells were expressing, or any steps taken to reduce bias. Figure 3D: There is a similar concern here as for Figure 1D. Here the number of cells is higher, but the density of the points is not shown. By eye the box plots do not look very different, violin plots may be better for these data so that the distribution of data points is more apparent. Figure 3F: it would be useful to have a representative image of each (stubby, thin, and mushroom) class, to help non-experts better visualize what's being analyzed . Result 4, paragraph 1, ‘..whether dendritic arborization is altered within 24 h after the transfection of the tested probes… ’ All the experiments were performed 24h after transfection, would it be worth testing different time intervals (e.g. 12-16h and/or 48h)? Result 4C,D E:  suggest adding quantification to enhance the data. Materials and Methods section, ‘ Live cell imaging and FRAP experiments,  post-bleach in every case (Supplementary Video 2)… ’.

It seems like the main benefit of BO is that it could require less forward passes through the network to find a binder with high pLDDT, but since extra time is required to embed the sequence with uniref, train the MLPs and find the gradient, it’s not clear how significant the speed up will be. Regarding the alphafold predictions of your design and the patgiri peptide, it seems like loop 1 is collapsed into the protein domain, as opposed to wrapping around the peptide, as one might expect it to given the Ras-SOS complex (PDB ID: 1NVW). Do you think it’s possible that alphafold is struggling to model the binding of the patgiri peptide due to the flexibility of the loops, and that is responsible for the abnormally low pLDDT?

The previous authors’ conclusions might or might not be correct. An alternative possibility is that some or all of these recurrences are/were, in fact, hypnozoite-unrelated in that they were recrudescences (not relapses), homologous recurrences being highly suggestive of a clonal merozoite (perhaps non-circulating) origin.

I like the approach of performing repellency tests with a higher throughput assay but having an exit hands-on-cage (real-world) assay. A few relevant issues occurred to me, which the authors may want to consider: 1) It might be more appropriate to report repellency in terms of protection (per EPA & WHO guidelines). Also, it seems that 75% repellency is too low. A good repellent should provide approximately 100% protection for a couple of hours. 2) As you know, the core principle of scientific publication is to provide enough information that a qualified person can perform the work. Several qualified researchers could test whether the newly discovered repellents are indeed more effective than DEET. However, the names of the new repellents, their sources, and chemical characterization (if newly synthesized) were not disclosed. {Is there a SI file I missed?] 3) Suppose there is an issue of intellectual property. In that case, this issue should be addressed first, and then the work should be considered for publication with a complete list of compounds tested, particularly those claimed to be more effective than DEET. Other minor issues for your consideration: 1) In the introduction, the sentence referring to the discovery of picaridin needs to be re-phrased. Picaridin was developed before insect ORs were discovered, let alone the co-receptor Orco. 2) Insect ORs are not G-protein coupled receptors, as implied in the introduction. Thank you for sharing a preprint in BioRxiv. It is a remarkable development.

Re: On the therapeutic potential of MAPK4 in triple-negative breast cancer Feng Yang Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas * Corresponding Author: Feng Yang, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX, 77030. Phone: 713-798-8022; Fax: 713-790-1275; E-mail: fyang@bcm.edu Boudghene-Stambouli et al. recently published “On the therapeutic potential of MAPK4 in triple-negative breast cancer” in BioRxiv concerning our Nature Communications publication, “MAPK4 promotes triple negative breast cancer growth and reduces tumor sensitivity to PI3K blockade.”, published 11 January 2022 (1). We want to reply to their comments as follows. Boudghene-Stambouli et al. essentially detected a similar MAPK4 protein expression pattern (Our report (1) vs. Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Fig. 1c) in the human TNBC cells, when using the same commercially available antibody AP7298b. However, they claimed, “We failed to detect a specific ERK4 band in any of the cell lines, including Hs578T cells transfected with human ERK4 cDNA.” They then used their own “validated custom polyclonal ERK4 antibody that we use routinely in our laboratories” to produce a different MAPK4 expression pattern (Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Fig. 1c). They provided a siRNA knockdown for the “validation” of their antibody. In this case, Boudghene-Stambouli et al. largely ignored our previous publications using the commercially available AP7298b to successfully confirm the overexpression, knockdown (up to five independent shRNAs), and knockout of MAPK4 in many human cancer cell lines and in “normal” cells (1-4). AP7298b can also detect a purified GST-MAPK4 fusion protein in the GST pulldown assays and the purified Flag/His-tagged wild-type and mutated MAPK4 proteins in the in vitro kinase assays (2). It should be noted that instead of our extensive validation of AP7298b using many MAPK4-overexpressing, knockdown (up to five independent shRNAs), and knockout cells as well as purified MAPK4 proteins (overexpressed/purified from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells), Boudghene-Stambouli et al. only used a single siRNA to “validate” their un-named custom antibody. Besides, they did not confirm HA-MAPK4/Erk4 overexpression in their Hs578T cells (Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Fig. 1c). Please note, due to the sensitivity of different antibodies, even if an HA-positive western blot is provided, it may not confirm significantly increased ectopically overexpressed MAPK4 expression over the endogenous MAPK4. Finally, their custom antibody detected many non-specific bands compared to AP7298b (Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Suppl. Fig. 1c, which was included in their submission recently rejected by [Journal name redacted to follow bioRxiv's policy] after peer-review). Therefore, we have concerns over Boudghene-Stambouli et al.’s concern on MAPK4 protein expression levels in the MAPK4-high TNBC cell lines that we used in our study (1). It is well-known that mRNA and protein abundances may not correlate well in biological systems. Therefore, Boudghene-Stambouli et al.’s concern about the variation of MAPK4 mRNA expression across the cell lines will not carry that much weight. We also noticed that Boudghene-Stambouli et al. used our reported 5’ primer but a modified 3’ primer for their qPCR data in Fig. 1a. We wonder whether they have performed qPCR using our reported 5’ and 3’ primers to detect MAPK4 expression (3), and what were the results? Besides, although we have not systematically examined MAPK4 mRNA expression in human TNBC cell lines as we did for human prostate cancer cell lines (3), we did qPCR confirmed MAPK4 expression in MDA-MB-231, SUM159, as well as the non-small cell lung cancer H1299 cells. Besides, Zheng et al. independently showed MAPK4 mRNA and protein expression in HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231 cells (5), two of the TNBC cell lines concerned by Boudghene-Stambouli et al. Without knowing the quality of Boudghene-Stambouli et al.’s RNA-seq data, we could not comment on their Fig. 1b data. Another concern of Boudghene-Stambouli et al. is their failure to verify our reported MAPK4-AKT signaling axis, a conclusion drawn from their Fig. 2 data. Without providing their data, the corresponding author Dr. Meloche has communicated with me about this issue. At that time, I provided the following answer. “I am not sure if you did a transient transfection in the 293 cells. Unlike MK5, phosphorylation of AKT is subjected to many more direct and indirect regulations in the cells. It is hard to imagine that you can easily detect MAPK4 phosphorylation of cell endogenous AKT in the transiently transfected 293 cells. It can be a hit and miss, especially if you do not carefully monitor cell confluency. I think that we only reported data from the stable 293T cells overexpressing MAPK4 or MAPK4 phosphorylating a co-transfected AKT in 293T cells. In the latter case, we suspect that these ectopically overexpressed AKT are less susceptible to endogenous cellular posttranslational modifications and more susceptible to the regulation of overexpressed MAPK4. Again, unless you can’t repeat our data, such as MAPK4 phosphorylating a co-transfected AKT in 293T cells, I do not see a common ground for our debate here either.” Now I see the experimental data, and Boudghene-Stambouli et al. did perform a transient transfection and tried to detect phosphorylation change of endogenous AKT, which we have already expressed concern about in our previous personal communications. Interestingly, as a positive control for their Fig. 2 data, Boudghene-Stambouli et al. showed MAPK4 enhanced the phosphorylation of an ectopically overexpressed but not endogenous MK5, raising concern about this so-called positive control per se. We are also unsure how much MAPK4 was overexpressed compared to endogenous MAPK4 (Western blots on GFP could not provide that information) nor the nature of the seemingly increased AKT T308 phosphorylation in the MAPK4 transfected 293 cells (Boudghene-Stambouli et al., Fig. 2). I want to finish this discussion using what I wrote to Dr. Meloche in another email. “Without detailed information from your side, it is hard for me to guess what happened. I want to emphasize several technical details that may help. 1. Please collect cells at about 50%-70% confluency. If your lab collected cells at very high confluency, please try this. 2. We have been using Dox-inducible knockdown and overexpression approaches. We typically maintain the cell culture without Dox induction and do a couple of days (such as three days) induction just before the experiments. 3. If you use a non-induction system as we did in some of our studies, please ensure that you only use the engineered cell lines at early passages. You can do this by freezing down many vials from a very early passage and only using the thawed-out cells for minimal additional passage(s). The cancer cells in culture may adapt to the cellular “stress” from long-term MAPK4 overexpression or knockdown.” We welcome open discussions based on solid experimental data. We will do our best to help if any group meets technical difficulty in repeating our data under the reported experimental conditions. We have validated our MAPK4-AKT signaling in more than 20 human cancer cell lines (Ref. (1-3), and unpublished data), and additional independent reports also confirmed MAPK4 phosphorylates/activates AKT in human cancer cells (5, 6). We welcome and are looking forward to more independent studies in this area. References 1. Wang W, et al.

I really love the inventiveness of the experimental set up! The results are really unexpected. The finding that phosphate starvation proceeds ABA mediated drought responses is interesting on a mechanistic basis and will likely have direct implications for crop management practices. The field-to-lab experimental pipeline looks really effective and I look forward to more people taking up this approach. I do have a couple of points that I believe the authors could discuss in more depth. In their ridge trials, the geometry of the soil may play a role. Phosphate starvation induces a lot of lateral roots close to the soil surface, to maximise phosphate capture. In the ridge set-up, lateral roots are restricted to only a single plane. Is it possible that this contributes to the PSR in ridge-grown plants? It is also possible that increased rooting depth under mild-drought treatment also reduces phosphate uptake. If the authors see a reduction in PSR gene expression after re-watering ridge plants, this may help to rule out geometric explanations. It should be noted that the pot experiments do already indicate this to some extent. I am also not so sure about the authors’ conclusion on why PSR is induced at mild drought but suppressed under severe drought “Under severe drought conditions, given the circumstantial evidence, our observations would support the notion that PSR induction is suppressed by a relative increase in Pi concentration due to a decrease in leaf water content (Fig. 4).” I would argue an alternative, more straight forward hypothesis, that plants simply prioritise drought stress over this level of phosphate starvation when drought is severe. Would the authors expect to see a recovery of the PSR if Pi levels dropped even lower? Once again, thanks to the authors for their very through-provoking study!

The comments were synthesized by Ehssan Moglad. The study conducted by Doyle et al. aimed to test the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) transfer activity of the human ORP5 protein via orthogonal targeting of different sites of membrane contact, namely, between the plasma membrane (PM) and the mitochondrial outer membrane. Major comments Figure 1: The idea behind the experiment is great, however, there are some questions about the data presented: - Recommend using better representative images, the morphology of the cells in panels B and C appears distorted, are these cells undergoing some death? This would make interpretation of the data difficult. - In Figure 1B, the control experiment should be done with a known mitochondrial marker to test if the construct works as expected. - P14P measurement using the P4M probe is unclear from the images and quantification provided. Please provide a multi-plane image of the probe showing its distribution on the PM and at the ER-PM or ER-mito contact site. - Please provide an additional graph to show the relative change of PI4P at the PM compared to the rest of the cell or respective contact site. - For a better comparison, recommend showing the normal (control) distribution of PI4P in the images. Results: ‘ As expected, we did not see the accumulation of PI4P at these contact sites (see graph in Fig. 1C), presumably due to SAC1 activity in the ER. Instead, the fluorescence of PM PI4P seemed to decline ’: Please indicate whether this result is statistically significant. Figure 2: The experiment with the FKBP-PI4KC1001 construct is not discussed in the text. Also, further clarification would be helpful for the results presented in panel B. In +SAC1mito, it is showing accumulation after Rapa treatment, please discuss why PI4P is not showing accumulation. 'The rationale was that without inhibition of PI4P synthesis, observing reductions in PM PI4P catalyzed by transport of PI4P out of the PM would require a rate that exceeded synthesis, which may not be possible through reduced flux at the much smaller surface area of induced PM-mitochondria contact sites, compared to ER-PM contact sites (compare Figs. 1C and D). We also imaged by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) to more sensitively detect changes in PM PI4P with the high-affinity PI4P biosensor, P4Mx2.': Recommend revising the fragment for clarity. Figure 3: The shape of the cells across figure 3 varies substantially, can some text be added to discuss why this is the case? Figure 3: The authors have already shown in a previous paper that SAC1 predominantly acts only in the 'cis' configuration. However, induced coupling of overexpressed ORP between ER-PM and mito-PM using rapamycin might bring these membranes closer than usual or cause the formation of more membrane contact sites. Thus, there may be some possibility for SAC1 to act in 'trans'. Alternatively, there could be indirect changes in PM PI4P due to increased activity of endogenous ORP5 at these induced contact sites. To address this: - Would it be possible to confirm if there was an increase in the number/size of contact sites by checking for mapper expression and localization when ORP5 constructs are expressed and coupled with Rapamycin? Lipid binding mutants of ORP5 could also be used to show that those lipid binding mutants do not cause a depletion upon coupling with Rapamycin. - For experiments where SAC1 (Fig 3) was overexpressed along with FRB::FKBP-ORP5-ΔTMD, please show control conditions where the SAC1 alone was expressed without the ORP5. Also, in a control condition where lipid binding mutants of ORP5 are expressed along with SAC1, there should be minimal effects on PM PI4P depletion compared to WT ORP5. Adding these controls will further confirm prior observations and substantiate the effects of FRB:: FKBP-ORP5-ΔTMD expression, and rule out any potential artifacts from overexpression of just SAC1. A major confound across all the experiments is the activity of endogenous ORP5 that is not measured. Is it possible to perform experiments (such as in Figure 3) where the endogenous ORP5 is downregulated using siRNA or shRNA and a siRNA/shRNA-resistant version of ORP5 is overexpressed in this background? There could be potential compensatory effects from other ORP5, and this would require simultaneous knockdown of multiple ORPs. Minor comments Figure 1: It could be helpful to start Figure 1 using a scheme of the two hypotheses on how ORP5 regulates PI4P levels at the plasma membrane. This will help easily assess the data presented in the Figures for and against the hypotheses. Figure 1A: It is difficult to see the co-localization in the current color scheme. It would be helpful to use a different color combination, provide zoomed-in images, or use pointers to highlight. Figures 1C and D: Please specify in the legend the timepoint when rapamycin was added and the subcellular membrane the measurements were made from. In discussion: 'In principle, this observation does not demonstrate lipid transfer (though it is compatible with it). Although tethering at a site of membrane contact seems to facilitate access of PI4P to SAC1, ORP5 could simply be presenting the lipid to the phosphatase, as opposed to depositing PI4P into the membrane for subsequent hydrolysis by SAC1. If ORP5 works in such a presentation mode, it is not clear to which membrane the resulting PI lipid is released: either back into the PM, or into the tethered membrane. In other words, lipid transfer is not necessarily part of the reaction '. Are there ways in which this can be tested? Suggest proposing some future experiments in the text.",2022-08-31T13:08:23,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2022.08.04.502856,Depletion of Plasma Membrane PI4P by ORP5 Requires Hydrolysis by SAC1 in Acceptor Membranes,"Colleen P.

Indeed, since our method is based on the number of reads at each location along the genome, sequencing-induced anomalies would in fact lead to spurious results if the method was used on unprocessed data. We have described our approach to reducing these effects in detail within the supplemental methods (Section IIIC, in particular subsections 2, 3, 4, and 10). In short, the analysis only uses loci that can be properly mapped. We first bin the reads into 1 kb regions, calculate the deviation of the reads from a 200 kb centered median, and then exclude the 10% most extreme 1 kb regions. We have found that this removes most (if not all) of the regions that have spurious local maxima/minima caused by the technical factors you've mentioned. In addition, for organisms in which there are known regions of poor compatibility with sequencing (Vibrio cholerae in particular), we have removed those anomalous regions by hand. We also use the standard method of dividing the exponential phase data by stationary phase data, since the sequencing-induced features are typically present in both cases. To further reduce the effects of noise, we have used the Akaike Information Criterion to select the ideal coarse-grained genomic resolution, thus optimizing the amount of signal we can obtain while minimizing the ability of noise and outliers to influence results. I hope that answers your question! Thank you so much for your interest in our pre-print!

The authors used distant Vespertilionids to place this root (instead, they could have used Kerivoulinae or Muriniae representatives, i.e. the sister-group of Myotinae, which would have been more effective in placing this root of Myotis). Also because they used only few Old World species, they gave little chance for that group to represent its full diversity.
