An example we touch upon are the changes in properties of inferred proteomes. Expression of the proteins and their modifications can profoundly impact the  real-life situation. I agree, including other  brackish basins is an important way forward. High quality Black Sea MAGs are now available (link below). Whey are an important resource for any follow-up studies, as it is not only more data, but qualitatively different ecosystem (different salinity, around 22PSU). What do you mean by Salian Sea?

In this figure it is not immediately clear how these mutant proteins were produced (extended data 7 makes clear this is from Pichia), this should be highlighted in the figure 3 legend. Additionally, the western blots for the truncations appear to be missing and perhaps the western blots for the individual cysteine mutations should be moved to the main figure. Finally, the interpretation of this data is that there is differential recognition of these SCPSs mutants and fragments between species, indicating that either there are additional receptors, or different epitopes are recognized by SCPSs-recognizing receptors in these species, or the SCPSs-recognizing receptors differ in their robustness of recognition. One alternative interpretation is that the apoplastic conditions are different between these species, and therefore these SCPSs mutants/fragments may behave differently depending on the species. Either this could be mentioned in the text, or a western blot should be added after infiltration to show the stability of these mutants in the apoplast of the different species.",2022-10-26T13:03:22,dianacamilagmezdelacruz,Diana Camila Gómez De La Cruz,10.1101/2022.10.06.511083,Convergent evolution of plant pattern recognition receptors sensing cysteine-rich patterns from three microbial kingdoms,"Yuankun Yang, Christina E.

This is demonstrated using T-DNA knockout lines, complementation, and CoIP. The authors show that SCPSs-like effectors from fungi other than S. sclerotiorum, oomycete and bacterial pathogens are also recognized by RLP30. In addition, they also show that SCPSs is recognized by different plant species. Based on sequence similarity to VmE02, the authors identify that the N. benthamiana receptor RE02 (also known as NbCSPR) can also recognize SCPSs. The authors then go on to delineate the recognized peptide from SCPSs, showing there is variation between plant species in the ability to recognize fragments derived from SCPSs. Finally, the authors show that RLP30 can also recognize an unknown elicitor found in small molecule fractions from Pseudomads, unlike the NbRE02. We enjoyed reading this well-written paper!

This would enable many new lines of questioning. Are MigPSY peptides triggering an immune response or mediating any sort of PTI-like response (i.e. triggering a ROS burst) in any root knot nematode hosts (i.e. rice)? How do plant receptors (such as Xa21) distinguish between endogenous and parasite derived PSY peptides? What are the molecular determinants for this specificity? It would be super interesting to study the potential co-evolutionary arms race between pathogen PSYs and host receptors. How did plant pathogens acquire PSY peptide mimics, evolutionarily speaking? Do non-plant pathogenic nematodes also have PSY peptides? Is it possible that non-plant pathogenic nematodes also produce these or similar peptides for other unrelated endogenous processes and then these were co-opted over evolutionary time to fulfil a role in pathogenesis?",2022-10-26T10:34:06,mauriciocontreras4,Mauricio P.

I think that this article was incredibly effective in proving the points hypothesized in the introduction and abstract. All of the information in the article tied back to information first brought up in the introduction, which helped me as the reader follow along and see the significance of the information being provided. I also appreciate how clearly the thesis statement is addressed in the introduction of the paper. The main idea of the paper is that physicochemical factors largely contribute to the phylogeny of aquatic bacteria. This is proven by the methods mentioned in the thesis, which is a phylogenetic and MAGs analysis. Although the purpose of this paper was briefly mentioned in the introduction as relating to climate change and understanding how changing environmental conditions might affect bacteria, the authors could have been a bit more explicit about how these findings affect this field of study. I would rate the significance of this paper as a modest contribution, because although the authors did tie its importance to climate change, more context regarding its place in the field would allow me to have a better understanding of its significance. The findings are important for understanding how climate change affects ecosystems and the organisms such as bacteria living within them, but again, more context would help in understanding the gravity of these findings. The methodology in this paper is convincing, and the only area I find questionable is the validity of MAGs in acting as an accurate representation of bacterial genomes. This question however is one addressed by the authors and accounted for in the data collection. The writing quality is a particular strength of this paper, and I thought the figures and thought process behind the data collection was well communicated to the reader.

It was very educational and understandable, even with limited knowledge of the field of Trypanosomes and parasitology. The contribution of the paper to really delve into the immunogenic capabilities of antigen variability of Trypanosoma is really providing a different perspective as to how it undergoes immune evasion. This detail really aided in surmising the paper's focal target of Trypanosoma responding to cells within extravasuclar spaces and their respective capabiltiies of changing their VSGs in such an environmental niche to best suit their survival as a whole. I was a bit curious of whether the tissue-dependency of this organism could be affected by different tissue types and extravascular conditions? For instance, would meningital tissue and extravascular spaces in the cranium feature a different response than enteroid tissue in the gut, and extravascular spaces there? The writing overall was very thorough and really helped to build my understanding.

Not only did confirm a lot of speculations that were proposed in prior studies, but it also highlighted a lot of new information about an aquatic environment (ie. brackish biomes) that has not previously been elucidated. It is intriguing that the transitions of bacterial communities both into and out of brackish bodies have glossed over in the field despite such type of environments taking up such a large portion of global waters. Some strong points of the paper that I noticed was that I liked how for the most part the figures in the paper were properly explained in the written portion and that the conclusions drawn were easily traced back to the data in the figures. It made going through the findings of the study a pretty straightforward process. In addition, I liked how you acknowledged the missing information from this experiment in your discussion section, such as exactly why transitions were more frequent into than out of brackish biomes.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.27.497797v1#comment-6021551985,biorxivstage,0,"Summarize the (at most) 3 key main ideas. The three key ideas I gathered from this paper were – 1.	Extravascular spaces appear as an important and previously overlooked niche for antigenic variation in T. brucei infection. 2.	Extravascular-resident T. Brucei play a profound role in the longevity and persistence of T. brucei infection by exhibiting novel immune evading VSGs. 3.	Extravascular spaces potentially facilitate antigenic variation by providing parasites extra ‘time’ to reside in the same. Main contribution of the paper This paper highlights the role of the extravascular spaces in enhancing and or prolonging T. Brucei infection. This is a novel finding because previous work on T. Brucei has barely studied antigenic variation in extravascular spaces. Most studies have been conducted on blood resident T. Brucei. Claims that state that T. brucei populations residing in the blood fully represent the antigenic complexity of T. brucei populations have been falsely passed on. Consequently, this paper helps break such false beliefs. Besides breaking false beliefs, the importance of this paper is further highlighted in the introduction section which states that most T. Brucei parasites reside in the extravascular spaces during T. Brucei infection. By providing a rationale over why they do so, this paper helps guide effective strategies to eliminate T. Brucei infection. Now for example, researchers are more likely to focus on preventing the entry of these parasites into the extravascular spaces since it is these spaces which provide the parasites their key pathogenic mechanism and or strategy. Critique One of the claims researchers make to explain how extravascular spaces help enhance and or prolong T. Brucei infection involves the immune system. The researchers specifically claim that extravascular spaces provide the parasites additional time to carry out antigenic variation. While the researchers have provided an immunological basis for this hypothesis of theirs (by including the IgM antibody), I do feel that it still too far-fetched. It could be the extensive VSGs found in the extravascular spaces provide parasites additional time to carry out more antigenic variation rather than the extravascular space itself providing the parasites additional time to carry out antigenic variation (through blocking IgM). To solidify their IgM hypothesis, perhaps they can block the IgM antibody of mice and then infect them. This way the additional time earlier enjoyed by only the extravascular residing parasites can also be enjoyed by the blood resident parasites. If blood-resident parasites in this condition just like the tissue-resident parasites start to demonstrate higher antigenic variation, then this can provide support for the researcher’s claim that the tissue’s provision of extra time is what makes the parasites undergo more extensive antigenic variation within the extravascular spaces. It is important to note that the researchers in this study made use of a specific model of T. Brucei. They used T. brucei EATRO1125 AnTat1.1E 90-13 parasites which are incapable of developing into their short stumpy forms (McDonald et al., 2018). This appears risky since the short stumpy forms of the parasite enable it to undergo apoptosis and cell death. Hence it could be that the parasites continued existence in the tissue could be due to their inability to undergo apoptosis rather than the VSG itself. This definitely poses challenges on the main contribution of the paper which associates prolonged T. Brucei infection to VSGs and antigenic diversity.   Hence while using this cell line helps researchers account for antigenic variations which are independent of development, it also likely causes continued parasite pertinence due to the inability of the same to undergo apoptosis. Surface proteins like VSGs which serve as key players in host-pathogen interactions are often subjected to strong selection pressures resulting in rapid evolutionary changes through mutation, recombination, and gene duplication. Consequently, studying VSGs repertoires is very challenging and I wonder how the researchers ensure the initial stability of VSGs for comparison post antigenic variations. Significance While I do think that the finding is novel and hence significant, I believe that the researchers can do a better job in explaining the applicability of this finding in the field of vector biology. There also exist some issues (model of the parasite used) which may make one skeptical about the paper’s main contribution and hence significance. Methodology I believe that the experiments were well-designed. This is because they made use of appropriate and highly accurate reagents and techniques. For instance, after obtaining the tissues from mice who had been infected with T. Brucei infection, the tissues were treated with TRIzolTM LS to obtain RNA. Usage of TRIzolTM has long been considered the “gold standard” for RNA purification. The all-in-one reagent can lyse extremely complex samples, is easily scalable, generates and or recovers ample RNA yield and is also effective in inactivating RNAses. This way the researchers ensure that they preserve the RNA quality, integrity, and quantity. To get rid of any contaminating DNA researchers also make use of DNases This prevents their sample from being contaminated and hence ensures the integrity of their data (and therefore claims). Additionally, the researchers also make use of the Mag-Bind Total Pure NGS which refers to a reliable solution used for the purification of both DNA and RNA for next-generation sequencing workflows. The technique enables the researchers to selectively bind fragments thereby providing the flexibility of left, right or double-sided size selection. The purified RNA generated post this technique is suitable for a variety of downstream applications such as NGS library preparation, microarrays, automated fluorescent sequencing. Knowing that the researchers use such a reliable technique to purify and select their RNA gives me confidence over some of their results such as the one presented in the abstract – the expressed VSG repertoire is not uniform across populations of parasites within the same infection. Following extraction of the RNA from the extravascular tissue post T. brucei infection, the researchers then obtain cDNA from the RNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase and a primer that binds to the conserved VSG 14-mer in the 3’UTR. Using the enzyme Superscript III reverse transcriptase to carry out the reverse transcription definitely serves to be advantageous. This appears to be an effective strategy since the particular enzyme has been modified to have a higher half-life, higher thermal stability, and reduced RNase H activity. Furthermore, using primers that specifically bind to the VSG gene enable, the researchers to obtain cDNAs of VSG. cDNA’s reflect expressed genes and obtaining the same for VSG hence helps provide researchers an idea of the extent of VSG expression. Post obtaining the cDNA the researchers then subject the same to 25 rounds of PCR using VSG-specific primers that contain a Phusion polymerase. Use of such a polymerase definitely serves advantageous since, the polymerase brings together a novel Pyrococcus-like enzyme with a processivity enhancing domain. This enables the generation of PCR products with accuracy and high speed which is something previously unattainable with single enzymes. This further adds to my believability of the results since the reagents chosen to appear to be high quality and error aversive. Once the PCR products are obtained, they are then quantified using QuBit HS DNA kit which is a kit that enables accurate and precise quantification of dsDNA. The resulting DNA which represents VSG genes present in extravascular tissue post infection with the parasite, are sequenced using Illumina sequencing which is a high-throughput sequencing technique. Consequently, through using high-throughput, modern and accurate techniques, the researchers definitely make their data appear accurate. Using these techniques also helps the researcher’s study both the genetic and epigenetic bases of antigenic variation. Antigenic variations often occur by altering the DNA sequence of an antigen encoding gene or the regulatory elements. The changes then cause alterations in the expression levels of the antigen.  Since the researchers in this study not only sequence the VSG specific genes but also obtain and quantify the cDNA extracted from the RNA of TRIzolTM incubated extravascular tissue, this method enables them to assess both and account for both the genetic and expression level changes that associate with the genetic basis of antigenic variations. In fact, this method even enables the researchers to account for the epigenetic variations of antigenic variations. During epigenetic variations, antigenic variations manifest as changes in their expression levels as opposed to changes in their genes. Hence even if sequencing data shows no changes which may lead to the assumption of no antigenic variation, coupling this method with cDNA acquisition and quantification, definitely enables researchers to account for the epigenetic basis of antigenic expression by providing the researchers a chance to study changes in expression levels (Cortés & Deitsch, 2017). According to (Stockdale et al., 2008), three key things are required for antigenic variation. The first requirement includes the need for a family of genes encoding antigenically distinct surface antigens. T. brucei contains more than 1000 VSG genes. Through having access to those genes using VSG-specific primers, PCR, and sequencing and that too of extravascular tissues post the parasite’s infection, this technique enables researchers to assess antigenic variations in extravascular tissue. Another requirement for demonstrating antigenic variation includes the need for a single pathogen to express one variant antigen gene at a time. This prevents the over exhaustion of the surface antigens repertoire. Through extracting and quantifying cDNA which represent genes which have been expressed post extravascular T. brucei parasitic infection, the researchers can assess the same as well. The third and final strategy needed to achieve antigenic variation includes a mechanism which enables the microbe to switch the single expressed antigen gene. T. brucei appears unique in that it actually acquires two mechanisms to achieve those switching. The first mechanism involves a single antigen gene being expressed and then being periodically silenced with another gene being activated. This can be assessed by the chosen method since it makes use of cDNA analysis. The second strategy used relies on recombination. Specifically, there exist a site for antigen gene expression. Switching to new antigenic variants is achieved by recombination into the specific site. Often times a silent antigen gene is copied and duplicated into the expression site deleting the resident gene. I am not exactly sure how the method helps researchers study such form of homologous recombination. Perhaps researchers can further venture into this. Most important limitation I believe the most important limitation of this study is the utilization of a model of T. Brucei which is incapable of undergoing apoptosis (due to the model’s inability to form short stumpy bodies). Since the entire study focuses on assessing parasitemia and relating the same to antigenic variation, how do researchers control for the effects of reduced apoptosis on the parasitemia? Another important limitation I would like to highlight is that involving the data presented in figure 5. The data in this figure is generated by the researchers testing for unique VSGs generated on day 6 in the blood. I wonder why this is the case. This is because in an earlier section, the researchers specifically mention that they did not assess for unique VSGs in day 6 since there were too few VSGs generated at the time. This makes me a bit skeptical about the results generated in day 6 since the data for the same in the context of unique VSGs was never presented. Another question that arises is why the authors specifically chose to study day 6 VSGs and exclude day 10 and 14 VSGs for this analysis. I believe that some rationale could be provided to better understand this choice of the author. Writing I would give this paper a score of 4 for its writing. This is because I genuinely feel that the researchers were able to communicate complex ideas in a simplistic and comprehensible manner. However, I think that certain terminologies such as tissue tropism, and certain concepts such as immune evasion could be further explained, since the audience may not have much science background. While I did not find any grammatical errors, I do think the researchers should keep track of the claims they make. For instance, in one section of the paper, the researchers wrote that they did not assess unique VSGs on day 6 since none were generated by then. However later onwards when describing the findings presented in figure 5, they stated that they assessed/looked for the unique VSGs on day 6 in the blood. These two statements appear contradictory and makes one skeptical over the writing and hence the overall study. Any questions the work leaves open? In this study the researchers find what they like to call unique VSGs. Unique VSGs are VSGs only expressed in certain spaces. I believe that the researchers can further expand on their study by assessing the role of these unique VSGs in tissue tropism. If the identified VSGs do play a role in tissue tropism, this can significantly uplift the impact factor of this research study given that tissue tropism changes during the course of infection and hence potentially serves a diagnostic tool. For instance, acute Toxoplasma gondii infections associate with gut cell invasion whilst chronic disease is characterized by brain invasion and neurological impairment. Trypanosome tropism towards the central nervous system causes a variety of sleep disturbances, psychiatric, motor, and sensory malfunctions. Hence understanding the potential of those unique tissue specific VSGs in T. brucei specific tropism can definitely improve the applicability of this particular paper. In this paper, the researchers show that majority of antigenic variation takes place in the extravascular spaces. It would be interesting to evaluate the survivability of the blood-resident VSGs prior to extravascular invasion using in vitro studies. This could potentially enable drug development which prevents the entrance of T. brucei into the extravascular spaces. In this study, the researchers only study VSGs for up to 14 days. At this point according to the researchers, tissue-resident populations only begin to diverge from one another and the blood. Studying longer periods of VSG expression can definitely help the researchers further address their aim of studying the role of extravascular parasites in T. brucei infection. I wonder why the researchers choose to only study 14 days post infection. Are there any limitations that restrict them for studying T. brucei for longer periods of time. The researchers in this paper also discuss about tissue-specific VSG selection. This seems to make quite a lot of sense. This is because other parasites like Plasmodium do express different var genes Besides studying for tissue-specific VSG selection, researchers in this study can also study the role of VSGs in things other than antigenic variation. According to Silva Pereira (20220, researchers are currently underestimating the extent to which VSGs are repurposed beyond their role as variant antigens. Indeed, there do exist nonvariant VSGs that perform specific functions such as serum-resistance associated VSG. To relate this future study with their antigen specific aims, they can assess how antigenic variations in VSGs evolve and or modify VSGs to carry out other unique functionalities. The researchers in this study discuss the applicability of their findings in the context of natural infections. They specifically claim that the variations can help the parasite survive in wild animals who may already have anti-VSG immunity. However, I feel that to improve the generalizability of the research’s findings to humans, researchers can assess if these antigen variation strategies enable the parasite to survive longer in a vaccinated human already acquiring VSG active immunity, nonvaccinated human already acquiring VSG herd immunity or infant already acquiring anti-VSG passive immunity. This can definitely be an interesting arena to look into.",2022-10-24T23:55:58,ShreyaJolly,Shreya Jolly,10.1101/2022.06.27.497797,Extravascular spaces are reservoirs of antigenic diversity in Trypanosoma brucei infection,"Alexander Beaver, Nathan P.

I enjoyed reading the article and it was fun to learn a little more about whale songs and their potential influences. Understanding how vocal learning and conformity is especially important as the noise environment continues changing in the ocean. Overall, the article had a lot of information that supported how much fin whales depend on vocal learning and conformity. I felt that your abstract and introduction requires additional information to understand the paper. There was a clear definition for vocal learning, but conformity and what a singing season is was not well defined. Additional information on fin whales would have also been nice to better understand their behavior not in the context of song. I liked how you included other examples of species to gain a better understanding and it also helped show that this study could potentially translate to those species as well. It was clear what questions you were trying to answer with your study, and you defined your results clearly without going too deep into it. For the most part your methods and results were clear to understand even for someone who has no background in what was studied! In Figure 2, I thought that I had was to potentially add a comparison in Panel C to the 1998/1999 season. It would be interesting to see the change that occurred in all the locations in the ONA region instead of just seeing the one shown in Panel B. Figure 3 was clear to understand and it supported most of the claims that were made in the introduction. I thought it was very cool to see how many ways these figures could be interpreted. An additional suggestion that I have is for Figure 4, I felt like the figure caption was bare and was missing some information to make it easier to understand and there was not much detail into what this figure was supporting so I had to make my own inferences into what was being shown there. Additionally, frequency of note was spoken throughout the article so the frequency on the y-axis was confusing so potentially changing or clearly defining that axis title would be beneficial. The discussion section in your paper went into a lot of detail and at times felt like too much. The discussion of the results that you obtained were lost in a lot of the extra information that was in it and at times were confusing since it felt like it was jumping around too much. At times it felt like I was reading a review article on animal songs instead of results from a study, but some of this information may be beneficial to have in the introduction section instead.

Your paper on random subcloning was a fun read! It's a similar result to MacArthur's Broken Stick model for species-abundance distributions, and a cool analysis. While the maximum fragment length has high variance under the null hypothesis you consider elegantly in random subcloning, it does not have high variance under engineered infectious clones. The statistic ends up being elegant because not only does it contain information on regular spaced-ness of the restriction sites, but it also relates directly to the bioengineering constraint of plasmid stability. If we assume the probability of prohibitive plasmid instability increases monotonically with fragment length, longest-fragment-lengths give us a meaningful lower-bound on the probability a given infectious clone is synthesizable. Consequently, we chose maximum fragment length as our summary statistic of the restriction map to capture both even-spaced-ness and synthesizability, believing this would be the best statistic (if we had to choose just one) for identifying infectious clones. That said, we're fascinated to see what future work lays ahead, and believe it's likely better statistics and classifiers of infectious clones may exist, although with such a small sample size it's also quite easy to dredge the data and so we chose one statistic very carefully & stuck with that in our work here.

Regarding the result, I noticed from Fig 5 that there are clear increases in acidic protein proportions for all transitions, but for the frequency of basic proteins, only the BM transition showed a slight increase. I was curious if there is an explanation for this. Additionally, I was a little confused if this paper is trying to suggest a causal relationship between functional gene content changes and cross-biome transitions, or if it aims at showing the association between these two events. Lastly, I was wondering if there are other ways (both computational and experimental) to validate the findings from this paper.

I’ve often read about this topic before, but this was a really novel take on the topic of antimicrobial resistance. Beginning with the introduction and abstract I thought there was sufficient background information provided on why this topic is important,  and why it is relevant to study today. In addition, it was also clear to me what the goal of this paper was (studying the effects of ARM-1 on Mfd). However, I would have preferred to see a little more background information on the Mfd compound. I understood how it operates to produce mutations, but I wish this compound was expanded upon a little more. Perhaps including some information on whether this compound is only seen in bacteria, and if not, are there any analogs in other organisms? Moving on to the first experiment, this was the only part of the study I had a little trouble understanding. I understood the underlying mechanisms that displayed the relationship of Mfd to the RNAP molecule, and how the ARM-1 compound thwarts this relationship. I just wish a little more context was provided as to how you arrived from 43 hits to ARM-1. When focusing on the next three figures presented I think that these were all done very well. I will, however, suggest for figure 2 perhaps splitting up the figure into two separate figures/parts. The first part containing information for figures 2A and 2B, and the next part containing information for figures 2C and 2D. I suggest this because the two halves of figure 2 discuss information that deals with separate topics. I thought that figure 3 was very clear and displayed your findings quite well! The only suggestion I have here is to define what “CTL” is. I tried to find a specific definition for this term in the paper but was unable to do so. Figure 4 was quite clear, and I found everything quite easy to understand! Overall, I really enjoyed reading this paper.

In comparisons of slightly more distant relatives, one could not really see the inversions but we saw an X-like pattens of conservation.

This papers analyses the autocorrelation in perceptual decision-making, and finds that it fluctuates between externally- and internally-driven strategies in ways that are strikingly similar between humans and mice. I very much enjoyed reading this work. The topic is exciting, and together with the Ashwood paper (which I see as a companion) this work will undoubtedly spur many future developments across psychology and neuroscience. The author's commitment to open science is laudable, and I am glad to see them making such good use of open, large-scale, community-curated datasets. I do have a few questions that are important to fully understand and validate the author's conclusions, and several minor suggestions. My expertise lies in the analysis of behavioral data, so I will mostly comment on main figures 1-4 rather than the model in figure 5. I thank the authors for also sharing this work as a preprint. As a signatory of Publish Your Reviews, I have committed to publish my peer reviews alongside the preprint version of an article. Specfically, this review will also be posted on the bioRxiv comments section. For more information, see publishyourreviews.org. Major questions 1. Do mode fluctuations have a characteristic timescale? I find terminology like 'oscillated as 1/f noise' (l. 985) a bit confusing - there may be frequency-specific oscillations, *or* a 1/f spectrum, but these are not the same ( https://www.nature.com/arti.... While the 1/f characteristic is clearly shown in Figures 2D, 3D, 4D (and the authors discuss self-organized criticality), I could not reconcile this with some other aspects of the analyses and writing. First, are phase and coherence not usually computed as a function of frequency? If so, which frequency is used in Figure 2E,F? Methods section 7.3.4 and l. 148 could be elaborated for readers unfamiliar with spectral analyses of behavior (how should the units of coherence be intrepreted?). Second, how can the simulation with a phasic mode switch at a single frequency (Figure 5A) give rise to a 1/f spectrum (Figure 4D), rather than a spectrum with an oscillatory peak (l. 425)? Third, there is a long history of investigating oscillations in perception (work by Fries, VanRullen, Kastner and many others, as the authors cite) albeit at a much faster timescale than shown here. Since the unit in this manuscript is trials (not time), are these two lines of work inherently incomparable, or can something be said about the typical trial length and therefore the interpretation of the best-fitting f = 0.11 in their model fits (l. 890/891)? Throughout the manuscript, it would help to distinguish oscillatory vs. 1/f. Alternatively, I may fundamentally misunderstand the results, in which case further elaboration and clarification would be great. 4. It would be very helpful if the full set of figure panels (as in Figures 2, 3, 4) was reproduced for each of their control simulations (S4, S6, S7), to better compare these models' behavior against human and mouse data. This would increase confidence in the main findings, and further pinpoint what exact behavioral signatures are unique to bimodal inference (rather than arousal fluctuations or decision bouds). I would like to suggest further control analyses to strengthen the existing ones. First, to conclude that internal-external mode fluctuations do not reflect periods of 'limited capacity', 'energy budget' or 'unstructured neuro-cognitive noise' (section 5.3), can you simulate and fit data from a process that additionally (or only) has periods of low/high perceptual sensitivity or task engagement (for instance, simulating high lapses)? Especially in the mouse data (and shown by Ashwood, there are likely periods of disengagement from the task, e.g. when mice become satieted towards the end of the session. One prediction may be that this would lead to more errors in history-congruent modes (as in 3A), Second, recent work (reviewed in https://doi.org/10.51628/00... has shown that slow drifts in decision boundary, without any strategic history-dependent updating, may give rise to statistical confounds and apparent history-dependence. It is difficult to intuit how such a process may affect the analyses presented here: could the authors simulate a process with only a slowly drifting bound (beyond the static response bias in section 5.4)? Minor suggestions 1. I applaud the authors for sharing their full workflow on OSF. However, I did find the format (all files in a zip) a bit difficult to work with: for instance, it's not possible to view the code in-line without downloading. To further increase the usefulness of the codebase to others, consider exploring ways to present the code in a way that allows easy re-running, inspection and versioning (e.g. in a notebook form, or at least with the scripts on GitHub). Also, comments on how to use the files (where to start? how to install/run? what are the dependencies? what version of R?) would be of great help to others who want to implement the same method. 3. Could the authors show standard (and history-conditioned) psychometric curves in both modes? This would show if there are considerable lapses, which can bias the estimation of history-dependent logistic regression models (see http://www.journalofvision..... If lapses are considerable, this may need to be taken into account in the model (or at least simulated to check that it doesn't introduce confounds). Related to this, how many human studies did not have stimulus strength information (and thus presumably only one level of task difficulty), and do the results look the same without studies with these missing data? 17. The authors recognize that trial-to-trial variations in stimulus strength (i.e. task difficulty) are a major driver of choices, and account for this in their control analysis. However, when defining stimulus-congruence, this is (as far as I can tell) only done based on the sign (i.e. a binary indicator), thus removing the _degree_ of stimulus congruence. Would the results look the same is stimulus-congruence was instead coded as a continuous variable, i.e. being more congruent when stimulus strength is high? 18. Why not show the logistic regression results in Figure 2B, which takes into account several confounds that are now hidden in the supplement? 19. Why do the mixed effects models only have random intercepts, and not random slopes? It seems that sensory and history dependence vary substantially across observers, which random slopes could capture. 20. Consider visualizing the phase information (Figure 2E) on a circular plot. To better interpret the coherence and phase information (see my first main question), it would be very helpful to discuss whether the two modes are anti-correlated/alternate at a specific frequency. 21. Please define 'infra-slow' when first used (see first main question). Is this characterized by a specific frequency range? 22. I am unsure if the selection of IBL mouse sessions may affect these results. Specifically, the authors here use a simple performance criterion of 80% in easy trials. However, in this task contrasts were introduced gradually, meaning that 80% correct on easy trials may happen early on in training as well as very late (with very different contrast sets). In Figure S5, could it be indicated which sessions were incorporated into the main analysis? Would the results hold if using a more stringent criterion to consider animals 'trained', as proposed in the original IBL paper ( https://github.com/int-brai..., which also incorporates bias and lapses)? A related point is that TDs are a lot larger (Figure 3H) than in the original paper (IBL et al. 2021, Figure 3 - supplement 2A), which may be remarked upon. 23. Also Figure S5: it would be of great interest to also see the within-session changes in mode, for mice as well as humans (see also my main question above on satiety). 24. The green plots in Supplementary Figure 2 are interesting but also a bit worrying, showing all sorts of autocorrelation in the stimulus sequences that make the paper's conclusions trickier to assess. The authors already discuss some features of the IBL task design that introduce specific autocorrelation patterns (i.e. post-error bias correction). Is such information, describing the specific algorithms for sequence generation, available for the studies from the confidence database? And could the authors relate specific stimulus sequences to the behavioral modes they observe? 25. In section 5.7, it should be noted that mice did receive single-trial feedback. How about humans? Splitting the confidence database into those studies with and without single-trial feedback could be used to nicely test the predictions in line 549 / Figure 5. 26. RT distributions are characteristically long-tailed, which can strongly affect scaling them. I am a bit confused that all values in Figure 2H lie below zero, should this not be zero-meaned? Was a transform (e.g. log) used before zscore? If not, could the authors show the RT distributions per study before and after outlier removal and scaling, to give a better sense of the distributions that were used in the analyses (or replicate 2H without normalization so that the real RT units are visible, as in 3H)? It would also be nice to add the range of individual cutoff values used for exclusion criteria (l. 776). 27. To make the magnitude of weights in figure 2B, 3B and 4B easier to interpret, consider adding the weight for sensory stimuli (see Abrahamyan figure 3 - may need to be on a differen y-scale). 28. lines 436-445: are these correlations linear, or may there be quadratic relationships between posterior certainty and RT, confidence, TDs? A supplementary figure would be nice. 29. Very minor: I had some issues printing the figures, likely due to many transparent datapoints in the pdf. For the final version, consider exporting the figures to a high-resolution bitmap format to reduce the size. 30. The work contains a couple of remaining typos (e.g. ressource'), duplicate words, etc. 31. l. 148, S2F -> 2F. 32. l. 653, where in the Ashwood paper is this number of >100 trials mentioned? As far as I can tell, they only analyze the first 90 trials of each session (see their figure 3E). 33. Some references should be updated: for instance, 21 is now published in eLife, and 12 & 66 point to the same paper (published and preprint). Please check all the references to make sure that they point to the most recent versions. 34. Consider adding author contribution statement and/or displaying this visually (see e.g. https://twitter.com/Steinme..., https://elifesciences.org/a... figure 6). Also, is there a reason why one author is now omitted, compared to the first bioRxiv version? Further questions As with all fresh ideas, this work raises many more questions that it can answer: while beyond the scope of this manuscript, I list some here so that they may be of use to the community. - Especially together with the paper by Ashwood et al., the obvious next question is the structure of mode fluctuations: are there two modes (as suggested here) or more (as suggested by Ashwood)? Do these switch in a discrete vs. continuous way? - At what timescale do states/modes change? How does this relate to even slower timescales in biology, e.g. at the level of circadian rhythms? - It is fantastic to see that large-scale databases are increasingly being used for cross-species comparison. In a way, it's a shame that these exist only for humans and mice. Are there plans or efforts to collect and publish similar databases from non-human primates (where many, many trials of perceptual decision-making tasks have been collected over the years)?",2022-10-24T11:08:05,,Anne Urai,10.1101/2021.08.20.457079,Bimodal inference in humans and mice,"Veith Weilnhammer, Heiner Stuke, Kai Standvoss, Philipp Sterzer",2022-07-05

I recently read this paper with my program’s journal club, and I want to thank you for your work on mEVs and early biomarkers of tobacco smoking-induced disease. My class learned a great deal of information while reading and discussing this paper, and I would like to present some suggestions and comments: The variety of techniques utilized to isolate and characterize mEVs here were impressive. However, I suggest including percentage breakdowns of the different populations studied on the flow cytometry plots (Figure 2A, 2B, 2E). This data may have already been calculated through FlowJo or could easily be calculated with this software, and it would be valuable to display these percentages to provide more precise quantifications of EV populations. In addition, I believe that Figure 2D may have been incorrectly referred to as Figure 5D in the results section titled “Extracellular vesicle concentration increases in circulation 1 hour after smoking in never-smokers”. Also, in the results or discussion section, I would suggest including a description of why there are four post-smoking samples in Figure 2F compared to the 20 non-smoking participants or the nine pre-smoking samples shown in Figure 2F. Next, if possible, I would also suggest conducting the tests performed on nonsmokers in Figure 1 and 2 on smokers as well, which could provide additional data on the acute effects of smoking and if these effects change with the chronic smoking of tobacco. I understand that this data may be difficult to collect, but I believe that it could bolster the content of this paper. Lastly, I was wondering what specific statistical test you conducted for this figure. The figure legend states that a non-parametric unpaired t-test was performed. However, I wonder if a paired test should have been used, as this data consists of blood from the same individuals pre- and post-smoking. Thus, I do not know if the groups can be considered independent. Also, t-tests are parametric tests, so I am unsure of what a nonparametric t-test refers to. This pattern of referring to a nonparametric t-test was also maintained throughout the paper. Was a Wilcoxon signed-rank test performed? If not, then I would suggest implementing this statistical test here, as it serves a similar purpose to a t-test but is applicable to paired, nonparametric data. For the other instances of unpaired nonparametric t-tests, I would suggest using a Mann-Whitney U test, which also serves a similar purpose to a t-test but is applicable to unpaired, nonparametric data. In Figure 4B, I would suggest expanding the heatmap to display MFI levels for each sample analyzed instead of condensing the data as shown. In this condensed form, the data is a bit difficult to interpret. Alternatively, I would suggest displaying some of the quantifications of activation marker levels described in the results section, as these quantifications would convey the same message but through a more easily interpretable form. The discussion around Figure 5 depends on a trend shown in sTREM2 expression and a statistical decrease in BDNF expression. In the results and discussion sections, the following conclusions made about the smoking-linked mechanisms of neurodegeneration may be a bit strong based on this data. I would suggest performing follow-up experiments on other neurodegeneration markers to strengthen this evidence or perhaps test BBB functionality, as this was a concept linked to neurodegeneration throughout this paper. I have a quick general note on the references section. I had some trouble finding a few of the papers cited in-text in the references section (e.g. Zalba et al. 2007, Sophocles Chrissobolis et al. 2011). My class had similar difficulties navigating the references section, so I would suggest following up on the consistency of citations in-text and within this section.

Additionally, the analysis in the results and discussion were logical and easy to follow. I do think at times there is some confusion/ambiguity regarding the sample sizes for some tissues. In the methods section, you mentioned that 3 brain samples (2 day 10, 1 day 14) and 1 heart sample (day 10) were excluded from analysis. When talking about Figure 2A, you said that the initiating VSG was detectable in 23/24 tissue samples from day 10. I was wondering if that was supposed to be 20/21 tissue samples? I had a similar comment with figure 3C and figure 4, where the legends say that n = 4 for each tissue. I think it would be helpful to mention that n=2 for day 10 brain samples and n = 3 for day 10 heat/day14 brain samples in the legends of figures 3 and 4 in case a reader did not catch that in the methods section. I also had two minor comments regarding figures. For 2A and 2C, since you are comparing the blood to tissue spaces collectively, I don’t think having the tissues being different colors is necessarily useful. It might be visually beneficial if all tissue samples were the same color (i.e. blue) like they are in 3B. Additionally, for 2A, 2C, and 5, the Y-axes say Log10(% parasites), but the tick marks show actual per cents.",2022-10-24T01:42:04,,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2022.06.27.497797,Extravascular spaces are reservoirs of antigenic diversity in Trypanosoma brucei infection,"Alexander Beaver, Nathan P.

Romagosa and colleagues present a twenty-one yearlong observational study of three critical components of the songs produced by male fin whales. It is the first study to suggest a mechanism driving vocal learning and conformity in animal songs, specifically pertaining to the fin whale. Romagosa & colleagues’ comprehensive analysis includes a dearth of both temporal and spatial data. The assessment the inter-note interval (INI, i.e., rhythm), the 20-Hz note, and the High Frequency (HF) note of the fin whale song is used as a conduit by which the authors reveal patterns of change and adoption of different patterns over time. The authors use a wide geographical range, inclusive of 15 sampling locations grouped into 7 separate regions, with data collection spanning between 1999 and 2020. They provide thorough consideration of alternate interpretations of their data and use the existing literature to further bolster their proposed ideologies. This manuscript has immense potential to posit something novel to the field, based on the background the authors have provided. However, due to the seeming overreliance on existing literature in the discussion, limited exploration and elaboration on the data itself in the results section, and poor articulation of caveats in the sampling methodology, the significance of the findings presented are undermined. Based on the targeted journal, a re-organization of the manuscript’s structure may be suitable to address these more structural issues. Despite the incredible amount of data, there lacks thorough explanations of how the data directly supports the conclusions presented. The results section could be elaborated upon to increase the credibility of the stated conclusions (examples starting in line 93 through 106, 119 – 127, 136-144). The discussion section does not implicate the data presented in this paper in the conclusions being made by the authors as much as it should, and it seems to rely much more heavily on existing literature in the greater field (i.e., extending beyond marine mammals). Switching some of the description of the data from the discussion section into the results section will make both sections easier to read and understand. . As these studies are purely observational, the methodology should be highlighted more, and as stated previously, perhaps may merit a structural reorganization of the manuscript itself. Because of the several sampling differences such as those in instrumentation & manufacturer, including the supporting evidence for why these data are still usable and comparable is critical to the credibility of the work (see Supplementary Material, lines 30 – 50). This experiment should be included either in the main body of the text or highlighted more explicitly in the main body, so the reader knows to find it there. The inconsistencies between recording machinery need to be explained, as the authors have performed an additional study to verify these data. Using figure 1 to be referenced primarily by the methods section is a poor choice of ordering, and perhaps the visuals provided in figure 1 can be moved into the supplement since they are not showing any data. This would leave available a spot to move the experiment in the supplementary material into the main text. Additionally, including more detailed figure legends (i.e., explaining that each symbol represents an individual recording/represents one day, explaining the red circle in current figure 1A in the legend, etc.). The same descriptive wording used in the legend for Figure 3 (specifically the information provided in line 133 – 135) should be applied to all figures in both the main and supplemental data. The rationale for the groupings of regions in the histograms of INIs and HF note peaks in Figures 4A & B is unclear and not indicated. Figure 4B is not discussed in the text either. Having panels in figures that are not described in the text is confusing, as the reader cannot understand what the purpose is of what is being presented. Generally speaking, the manuscript was a delight to read. It was well-written, and I felt that the background and foundation for the work presented was laid out very well. This data that is being presented has exciting implications for the field and fills in a clear gap in knowledge. The amount of time and dedication that was given to these studies should not be understated. I felt that the authors framed their goals and provided comprehensive context for the material being shown.

As for feedback, I gathered from the article that this research contributes to the notion that scientists need a new way to think about targeting antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Here you provide the audience with a new method of preventing the bacteria from evolving at all. While previous interventions focused on killing the evolved bacteria. However, did you ask questions about addressing the bacteria that have already developed into something like, let’s say MRSA? Your approach evaluated in this research is new and innovative, but it does not mention the life of the bacteria after it has evolved as a limitation. With that said, I feel it would greatly benefit this article to contain a limitation section so you could reflect on possible improvements for future work and shortcomings of the current work. Other questions to address in this section would be what happens if AMR bacteria does evolve and what parameters are in place to inhibit it? Specifically, you leave the audience wondering how ARM-1 can be used medically. I feel since this is a huge component of why you did this research, it should be addressed in the conclusions section. How can it be used? For whom? What would access look like? Where is it most needed? Who and what countries could benefit? Why is this intervention the best course of action for people?  How could it actually be used as an anti-evolution drug? There is a disconnect for me when I compare the outcome of the research and how it can meaningfully impact medicine beyond just stating that it can. Although this paper was scientific, it is dense for someone coming from a non-science background to digest. I did feel it was logical and well-written but could have benefited from being broken up into more sections. I found myself rereading the results section since you combined the methods, results, and figures altogether and only had four subheadings. Although you have a discussion section, I felt that your discussion section was actually in your results section and that your discussion section acted as a conclusion section. This made it challenging for the reader to synthesize the results section in an efficient manner. From reading the summary, I felt the main idea is that the inhibition of Mfd activity by the lead compound ARM-1 delays the development of mutations and resistance acquisition in pathogens. This finding then demonstrates that molecular mechanisms are targetable which ultimately could prevent AMR in future pathogens. If this is not what you are trying to convey, then I would advise reworking your summary and or introduction. I agree with others that replication of the study could benefit more concrete findings to solidify the argument this article is making. I do feel this paper dives into some really interesting questions which I feel need to be explored further. In terms of the next steps and future experiments, figuring out how your research fits into the lifecycle of the AMR bacteria could prove insightful. Overall, good job, it is an important research topic that has not been addressed in the way you present it and I feel it is adding to the field of science.

Thus, any hypothetical engineer of the RE sites would have to go to enormous lengths to purposefully mimick natural bat coronaviruses that have only been discovered in the past 2 years: a very dubious proposition. The far simpler alternative is that the sites evolved via natural recombination from natural bat coronaviruses. Further, if one examines the genomic regions around each restriction enzyme sites, we find that SARS-CoV-2 shares general genetic similarity with the virus(es) it shares the RE site (or lack therefore) with. This would further indicate that they were inherited via recombination. For example, two BsaI sites missing in SARS-CoV-2 are also missing in the RpYN06 batCoV, which follows naturally from the phylogenetic prediction that RpYN06 is the nearest neighbor in that region. Correspondingly, SARS-CoV-2 shares not just the lack of the BsaI sites in this region, but several other mutations as well: a signal entirely inconsistent with engineering and entirely consistent with natural recombination. The same is true with other natural batCoVs if you examine any of the RE sites described in this work. For the engineering hypothesis, this would have to imply that someone not only modified the RE sites to match natural viruses, but also unrelated nearby sites as well - an even more ludicrous proposition that I do not think even these authors can defend. Finally, this sort of analysis can be be done systematically by reconstructing a recombinant ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, as the two papers below did: https://www.nature.com/arti... (See Fig 2) https://www.science.org/doi... (See Fig 6) The recombinant ancestor is a reconstruction of the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and other known bat viruses in each region of the genome. The recombinant ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 indeed shares the exact BsaI/BsmBI RE pattern of SARS-CoV-2, minus a signal synonymous mutation: thus further proving that these sites were naturally acquired via recombination. This follows intuitively from the observation that different bat viruses each have some of the RE sites described in this work, and that each bat virus that shares an RE or lack therefore with SARS-CoV-2 is the most recent common ancestor of that genomic region.

In particular, the file with 'alignment-with-RpYN06.fasta' which includes a comparison with several batCoVs ignored in this preprint.

Just goes to show the strength of researcher collaboration for the purposes of broadening our understanding of important topics. I do, however, have some comments on your paper which I would like to share. I should preface this with a  statement of reflexivity - noting that I am not a marine biologist or within an associated field of interest, but have a background in the social sciences and an interest in One Health. Further, as a current academic and researcher in the social sciences I view your work through the lenses inherent to my discipline. I acknowledge the limitation that my lack of prior technical knowledge in this field brings, and intend to provide a critical perspective that may conform to those that also view your paper without prior technical knowledge. That said, I was initially drawn to your article because of your title. As such, based on your title I was expecting to read about a novel new notion of 'song conformity among fin whales'. Through your background, and discussion sections, I learnt that song conformity is an established notion for many animals, and species of whales - including fin whales (Line 243). So, while the title is clear and short, it also leads the reader to expect to learn about a new concept that is 'song conformity', but you later note that evidence of song conformity exists among fin whales already. Perhaps your paper would benefit from a reevaluation of the title to clarify that you intend to show, through a synthesis of multiple study datasets, trends within fin whale songs over a long time horizon. In your abstract, I thought you presented your main arguments quite well (Lines 25-28), though could have added a little more detail on your methodological choice and your study population (male fin whales) - perhaps in Lines 23-24. In Line 29, you note that you found ""evidence of vocal learning of rhythm"" and ""conformity"" - these are strong findings - and I was keen to read more. I thoroughly enjoyed reading your introduction, and I was most interested in reading your problem statement - and more specifically, the gap in the literature that you were trying to fill. In Lines 59-63 you note four distinct gaps that is our understanding of (1) the functional mechanisms of vocal learning, (2) natural selection and learning strategies, (3) the benefits of song conformity and (4) individual decisions impacting song evolution. You also note that ""vocal learning of rhythm is ... poorly understood"" [Line 62], and research focuses on complex songs. You call for ""a broader view"" to piece a part the different mechanisms of vocal learning to better understand prevalence and evolution [Lines 63-65]. Here I was anticipating a little more detail on what you meant by ""different mechanisms"". Also, while it was certainly interesting to read about all the gaps in our understanding of vocal learning and conformity, it wasn't immediately clear to me which of these gaps your work was seeking to address. A little more clarity here would have helped. In your methods section, I was intrigued to read about the processes that were involved in the creation of your analytical dataset. It seems like you had some challenges synthesizing inconsistent recordings which created some gaps in your dataset, and necessitated the exclusion of some data. Since the data was so critical to your examination of trends in songs over time, it would have helped to provide a figure tracking the data itself - e.g., the amount/type/nature of data that was available to you, the amount/type/nature of data that was excluded, and the amount/type/nature of data that made it into your final analytical dataset. Furthermore, I would have liked to have read a little more about your statistical assumptions. You employ the use of histograms to compare song distributions among periods/regions, I would have liked to have read a little more about whether you performed statistical analyses to assess distributional similarities (KS test?). In your results section, Figure 2 was intended to demonstrate song changes over time. Using the ONA SE dataset you present avg. song INIs over time, a stacked bar chart summarizing the three song types within the period, and a spatial presentation of this stacked bar chart. Maybe I missed it, but it wasn't clear to me how you technically defined and labelled ""hybrid"" songs in your dataset - from Figure 2 Panel A I noticed song INIs that fell within the 12s-19s range but the confidence intervals appeared to overlap into both the 12s and 19s ranges. Without further information, this did not appear to be clear evidence of a hybrid song. Much more clarity on how you defined hybrid songs, as well as an accompanying (supplementary) table on statistical summaries would strengthen your work here in my opinion. Figures 3 and 4 intended to show long term song trends (in avg. song INIs and two song parameters), and distributional comparisons of song INIs for regions and periods where simultaneous recordings were made, respectively. Much more clarity on the organization and interpretation of the data for Figure 3A would have been appreciated. Multiple ocean regions are plotted on the same graph, and a trend line is plotted through them. My first question is, are these regions comparable enough to be plotted side-by-side? For in other words, did these regions start from the same origin point? Is the trend being largely driven by ONA or the BBIC? Finally, in your discussion section, you do a good job contextualizing your research. And, explain your results through factual and counter-factual arguments (e.g., these results can't mean 'this' because if they did 'this' is what we would have found). At times, you extend the meaning behind your results a little too far for comfort - for example, when describing your results in the context of mating [Lines 241-254]. The arguments make sense, but without further evidence, it veers into conjecture. Though, in my opinion, this is a problem with the way you've framed your discussion pieces rather than a problem with the content itself. It would have been helpful to read a section on the limitations of your study design, and limitations of your study findings which would have clarified areas where you noticed anomalous results (such as the Barents Sea findings). All-in-all good work, though as a lay-reader, I did need more information at times and some clarity on your processes.",2022-10-22T22:22:22,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2022.10.05.510968,Fin whale singalong: evidence of song conformity,"Miriam Romagosa, Sharon Nieukirk, Irma Cascão, Tiago A.

I have a hard time telling the difference. Also, when I do Golden Gate cloning, the restriction sites are erased as they are designed to be in in opposite orientations to each other such that the ligated piece no longer has the restriction sites. This enables assembly in one tube by incubating the pieces in the presence of both the restriction enzyme and the ligase. How would introduction of these restriction sites be of benefit for Golden Gate or any other type of cloning? Because the restriction sites aren't removed, one can't simply digest the DNA and ligate the pieces in in one reaction as the restriction enzyme will cut all the sites again as you put each piece in.

I was also very glad to see that ARM-1 can delay the onset of AMR in multiple strains and even in strains that already devleoped resistance, which looks much promising/hopeful. However, I do have some questions about your experimental design and results. So for your highthrough-put drug screen, I saw that you used two plasmids, one with IPTG-inducible promoter, the other one with LacI/LacO roadblock. I just wonder if IPTG, which mimics allolactose, would have any off-target effect on LacI repressor? I can clearly tell that your ARM-1 inhibits mfd by your following results, but I was just wondering why you did not use any promoter that is inducible by any compounds other than allolactose analog. (Also I could only see panel 1a for supplementary figure 1, did you forget to upload the other panels?) Another question is about Figure 2c. I noticed that with the presence or absence of ARM-1, the EC values are roughly the same in this figure. You reasoned it as ""The reduction in the ECs in the presence of ARM-1 is most likely because, at equilibrium, when RNAP cannot dissociate from DNA, it cannot re-initiate transcription, consequently preventing new EC formation."", which did not make much sense to me at first. If that is the case, the EC value with ARM-1 should still be higher than that of the group without ARM-1, unless ARM-1 is not working at all. So I checked the supplementary material, and found that you repeated the expeiment, and the mean value for ARM-1 -ve group is 0.40, that for ARM-1 +ve group (different conc) range from 0.6-0.8, and this makes much more sense now. So I think if you should put the mean value in Fig 2c instead? (For supplementary figure 3, in panel a I saw two 25 and one 12.5 microM ARM-1 tested, but in panel b I saw two 12.5 microM and one 25 microM in the table, you might want to double check on that.)

I know that there was a supplemental table talking about where the MAGs came from, but I think it would be better to put that somewhere in the paper (either the results or methods) because it has a lot of important information.

Also, this study shows that bacteria transitioning between different marine biomes is pretty rare. However, the study also showed that there are some species of bacteria that are making these transitions.

It is my pleasure to make these remarks. The work is well structured, well researched, and properly presented, easy to read even for non-scientific audiences. When going through the details though, I could not keep the concepts of hospital-acquired infections, antibiotic resistance, and the emergence of novel diseases out of my mind, particularly because of how they are linked to the overall concept of microbial diversity and adaptability. For antimicrobial resistance, for instance, the underlying factor has everything to do with the transfer of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) between two genomes. When MGEs access the chromosomes of new bacterial hosts, the outcome is phenotypical alteration. If the MGEs contained antibiotic resistance then novel or ongoing pathogenesis may result. Nevertheless, your study has demonstrated that bacterial species rarely cross environmental barriers. However, it is interesting to note that this is not the entirety of the results because there are distinct transitions between aquatic biomes, which, noteworthy, are ancient, rare, and often directed towards the brackish biome. At the same time, there are frequent transitions into brackish sites, which are harder to explain. I am just concerned, are there tests that can ascertain these claims? Previous studies have identified that bacteria are opportunistic and may manipulate any loophole to establish supremacy. The concern is further aggravated by your additional findings, that brackish bacteria often exhibit enriched gene functions for various physiological responses, including transcriptional regulation, which is integral in the re-writing genetic information, further begging the question should there be a cause for worry.",2022-10-22T00:15:10,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,10.1101/2022.10.03.510577,Large-scale phylogenomics of aquatic bacteria reveal molecular mechanisms for adaptation to salinity,"Krzysztof T Jurdzinski, Maliheh Mehrshad, Luis Fernando Delgado, Ziling Deng, Stefan Bertilsson, Anders F Andersson",2022-10-03

The authors identified a small molecule (ARM-1) that inhibited the RNA polymerase-associated DNA translocase Mfd, a protein shown to be involved in the development of antimicrobial resistance, and inhibited its ability to dissociate stalled RNAPs from DNA and had a modest impact on intrinsic ATPase activity of Mfd. The assays used were well suited for the study and revealed ARM-1's ability to inhibit Mfd and reduce the rate of mutation in bacteria grown in culture and during the course of infection of a human cell line. The authors also highlight that there was no detectable resistance of the bacteria to ARM-1 and that ARM-1 is able to deter the development of anitmicrobial resistance in diverse bacterial species.

I really hope you can address these issues before certain “news” organizations gets ahold of this. One criterion for IVGA is even spacing of cut sites, yet the SARS-CoV-2 BsaI/BsmBI fingerprint includes a tiny 643nt fragment within nsp13/helicase. This region is identical to SARS except for a single I->V mutation, so why would anyone engineering this virus want to separate this fragment to then do nothing to it? I prefer to believe this is just a cherry-picked pair of restriction enzymes and random noise. One could argue that this is similar to the less even iWIV1 cuts (Figure 2B), but iWIV1’s shortest fragment is still much larger than SARS-CoV-2’s and is only so short because of plasmid instability reported by Zeng et al. This unstable region is, however, very far from SARS-CoV-2’s short fragment, so again I see no reason why anyone would need this short fragment for engineering. Relatedly, although the longest fragment length is minimized when cuts are perfectly even spaced, statistics based on longest fragment length are not robust against tiny fragments and lead to false positives. Accounting for all fragment length by fitting to Poisson/exponential distributions would give better statistics, and I’m sure that SARS-CoV-2 would become less significant i.e. nothing in Figure 3A looks at all like Figure 2A.",2022-10-21T16:40:50,disqus_8AVEuorTBu,disqus_8AVEuorTBu,10.1101/2022.10.18.512756,Endonuclease fingerprint indicates a synthetic origin of SARS-CoV-2,"Valentin Bruttel, Alex Washburne, Antonius VanDongen",2022-10-20

I think the article needs to give us the proof that population that measured overtime at different place are not the same, that there is no replacement of a group by another one, do the group get mixed? Since the authors are looking at evidence of song learning and conformity, I think it is important to ascertain that we are talking about different population across different geographic location and not the same group that would be recorded over different time period at different place.

But I’m curious if there is any other reason why they chose Mfd as a target? For example, if there is any other advantages of targeting Mfd. Or if there have already been studies focusing on molecules targeting Mfd so there’s already material for this research. Also, I’m curious whether there are any other possible targets for anti-evolution. Maybe going deeper into possible mechanisms of anti-evolution could help me even better understand the importance of this research. As for the methods, I believe it’s already clear enough. One thing I’m interested in but not explained in the article is that, where did the authors get these candidate compounds. Is it based on previous research or specific design. I think giving more information in this part may be helpful for clarifying the origin or differences between theses leading compounds. The figures and results are very clear and closely related to the hypothesis under testing. It may be clearer to me if the authors can briefly explain why the chose these strains of bacteria for detection. For example, for what reasons why they can be representative. The discussion part is clear and thorough. I was hoping there could be more exploration on this result. For example, I am curious whether similar target exist in other pathogens like fungi. If there are any other major limitations for this method or leading compound. Moreover, there could be more explorations on the potential further research directions since this idea is refreshing and inspiring. Overall, I really like the idea of re-thinking solving AMR form the root, and interpretating this problem from evolution’s point of view.",2022-10-21T03:03:05,h_bao,H Bao,10.1101/2022.09.26.509600,A small molecule that inhibits the evolution of antibiotic resistance,"Anna E.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.10.511625v1#comment-6018071163,biorxivstage,1,"I would like to thank Dr Crits-Christoph for his detailed critique Regarding point (3) Dr Crits-Christoph states that many of the intermediate genomes derived from a ""dataset with poor coverage, that included the vast majority of samples which had no coverage at the relevant sites."" If he has evidence of zero coverage at relevant sites in the 'vast majority of samples' then we encourage him to share it. Likewise, it would be of great utility if he could provide evidence of miscalls at positions 8782/28144 in the Sichuan/Wuhan C/C intermediate genomes. Bafflingly, Pekar et al. include over 50 genomes from the Lin et al (2021) dataset in their analysis but chose to exclude 12 C/C intermediate genomes from the same dataset (we identified 12 additional C/C intermediates that they did not consider that we note in our bioRxiv preprint). This is inconsistent with Dr Crits-Christoph's claim. that the 'vast majority...had no coverage at the relevant sites'. On what basis did they choose to retain these >50 genomes, but discard the C/C intermediates? This appears to be a clear case of selection bias. The genomes generated by Lin et al (2021) are of variable coverage - however, from their Table S2 the average % coverage with > 1 read is 95.5% (for Sichuan genomes). The likelihood is therefore that most genomes will have coverage at position 8782 (and given that all positions 28144 are called as C, it can be assumed that these all have coverage there, as Wuhan-Hu-1 has T at this position). A case in point regarding the quality of the Lin et al dataset: C/C intermediate EPI_ISL_451389 has 99.8% coverage with  > 10X read depth. This is a good quality genome therefore. Problems with the inferences made regarding claimed A and B specific SNVs in some of the C/C intermediates were discussed in: https://zenodo.org/record/7... Here is an updated summary: ' Seven intermediate genomes were excluded for possessing what were described as A, B or a combination of A and B specific SNVs.The rationale given was that these were A or B lineage genomes that acquired convergent mutations at positions 8782 and 28144 to produce C/C or T/T genotypes. However, if a B lineage genome acquired the mutation T28144C, converting it into a C/C intermediate, this would be a reversion mutation rather than a convergent mutation. In addition, no data was provided to demonstrate that a particular SNV was A or B specific. Four of the genomes had only one A or B specific (however defined) SNV (EPI_ISL_1069206 had one A specific SNV, while EPI_ISL_451390 and two unidentified genomes had one B specific SNV each). These could just as easily represent homoplasies that arose via convergence. No caveat to this effect was included in Pekar et al. Whether the remaining 3 genomes that had more than one SNV (claimed as A or B specific) are located intermediate between lineage A and lineage B genomes on a phylogenetic tree, or were phylogenetically aberrant, was not tested by the authors.' Dr Crits-Christoph claims some of the C/C intermediates are 'phylogenetically aberrant'. One way he could substantiate this is by showing this on a phylogenetic tree (remembering that homoplasies result in 'phylogenetic aberrance', indeed this is one of the manners in which they are detected). 21844 will be changed to 28144 in the next version of the preprint, thankyou for noting",2022-10-20T23:49:36,disqus_plWzQuLdvi,Steven Massey,10.1101/2022.10.10.511625,Statistical challenges for inferring multiple SARS-CoV-2 spillovers with early outbreak phylodynamics,"Alex Washburne, Adrian Jones, Daoyu Zhang, Yuri Deigin, Steven Quay, Steven E Massey",2022-10-13

It provided new insight on antibiotic resistance and provided a new approach that could have potential to be developed into drugs for future use. It is easy to see the big picture when reading through the summary, however there was no clear hypothesis to the study but only a sentence about the big picture of what the methods contained. Including a hypothesis may be better to communicate what the goal is of this study. Readers do know what steps were involved but it may be unclear at first why are we testing this and what results or conclusions are we trying to get to. the results and figures did support each other and each method had correlated figures that showed the results from that method and made it easy for me to understand the results. However, because the result and methods are grouped  into one big portion, it was a bit hard to follow the flow of how the experiment was done. I had to go back and forth between each subheading to be able to have a big picture of what the methods were. The results were also scattered in each section and I had to go through the whole results section to be able to have a summary of results. If I were trying to duplicate results, this may take me more time to go through as there is no separate methods section. I would have to read through everything for each step of the research. I liked how there were analysis of in vivo and in vitro as well as biochemistry of ARM-1. Yet there was not a lot of replication done. With replications of study, it could help strengthen the findings, although sone findings here are consistent with previous findings, which does strengthen the argument. I liked how there were a lot of references, however a lot were from 10 years or older, which may be outdated. It would be better to include more recent findings or studies to strengthen the arguments.

However, it would be useful to provide a more detailed description of the methods, particularly to clarify the following points: Q1: The training labels are applied to 200bp bins, but the input sequences are expanded to 1Kbp centered on each bin. I'm confused about how the labels propagate when the windows are expanded. Let's say you have a negative bin that neighbors a positive bin. When you expand the 1Kbp window around the negative bin, the input sequence will encompass the positive bin. Is this 1Kbp input then labeled as positive or negative? Q2: When you split the data into training/validation/test, do you randomly choose bins or restrict them to particular chromosomes? If you randomly choose 200bp bins for your test data, won't the sequences from the test bins also be present in the training set (because of the way that windows are expanded to 1Kbp)? Q3: How were the Enformer and Basenji2 models trained? Are they trained on all data at once (i.e., multi-headed output model) or on each dataset separately? Q4: According to Supp. Table 1, most models include the following hyperparameter settings: convKnernal1st=320, convKnernal2ed=480. These hyperparameters are labeled as follows in the table:  ""convKnernal1st: The filter size of first convolution layer; convKnernal2ed: The second size of first convolution layer"". I'm confused by this description. Do these hyperparameters represent the filter width or the number of filters in each layer? I'm presuming the latter, but then what width filters were used?

In fact, they are more likely the consequence of superspreading events that occurred after introduction, such as Mardi Gras. Introductions don't cause polytomies, superspreading does. Second, you've actually made our point for us: the problem with FAVITES is precisely that it models within-host evolution while also spreading superspreading events over timescales during which within-host evolution can occur. Whereas real-world superspreading can take place in hours, FAVITES superspreading will take place over the entire infectious period. With a stationary propensity of within-host mutations, FAVITES will have a much higher probability of turning a 3-hour choir-practice superspreading event into a 9-day event (with many being extremely long, due to the exponential distribution of infectious periods in the model). This isn't a good model of superspreading-evolution of SARS-CoV-2. The genomic data for the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is not peculiar - it's exactly like the other early-outbreak polytomies you cited, and those weren't caused by spillover, they were caused by superspreading. Some of the efforts to see peculiarities in early outbreak genomes/trees are also prone to observer bias. I can look at a license plate in front of me - NGK 190 - and say ""what are the odds of *exactly* that? I can run a null model of license plates and say ""basically no chance of that"". Then, I can make a license plate that's restricted in my favor. It'll have a much higher odds of NGK 190. That doesn't mean my new model is right. It means my initial probabilistic assessment of an unusual feature I picked up is prone to observer bias.

The first criterion is puzzling as it is not explained why the absence of the 2 SNVs observed in the two Beijing genomes, in other early Lineage A or B genomes, is significant.

Review synthesized by Ruchika Bajaj. This study has developed a novel one-step methodology for the incorporation of membrane proteins from cells to lipid Salipro nanoparticles for structure-function studies using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), which is a profound technology in the field of membrane protein structural biology. We raise some points that may strengthen the manuscript below: Main section, 4th paragraph  “ resuspended in digitoxin-containing buffer ”- Does the sentence mean that membrane proteins were solubilized by detergent before reconstitution into salipro particles? Are salipro and digitoxin added at the same step? If this is the case, it is unclear how one can distinguish between the step wise solubilization and reconstitution or direct reconstitution into salipro particles. Further discussion on the mechanism of reconstitution would be helpful. In the same paragraph, the fragment “to increase membrane fluidity and render lipids” raises the question of whether the concentration of digitonin was optimized to balance the increase in membrane fluidity but not rendering the solubilization of membrane proteins. Main section, 4th paragraph, “ the formation of saponin-containing mPANX1-GFP particles was assessed by analytical size exclusion chromatography using fluorescence detector ” -  It is assumed that fluorescence is detected from GFP. As the construct expressed is PANX1-GFP, GFP fluorescence signal will be received from reconstituted as well as not reconstituted PANX1. Is saponin specific signal being used as a signal for measuring the reconstitution of PANX1-GFP? In the same paragraph, “ PreScission protease for on-column cleavage ” is mentioned. Is GFP still intact in the expressed PANX-1 or is it cleaved? A diagram of these procedures showing the various steps will be helpful for readers. Main section, 4th paragraph “ SDS-PAGE revealed the formation of pure and homogeneous Salipro-mPANX1 nanoparticles ”- However, extra bands are present above the major band in Figure 1E, can some comment be provided on this point. Possible explanations for the additional bands could be post translational modifications or degradation of mPANX1. Methodology section, “ membrane protein reconstitution screening using fluorescence-detection size exclusion chromatography (FSEC)” -The amount of salipro is given in ug. A comment on the ratio of protein to salipro particles would be important to decide the concentration of salipro with respect to the mass of the cell pellet. Figure 1G: The molecular weight of Salipro-mPANX1 particles is mentioned to be approximately 466kD. mPANX1 weighs about 48kD and heptamer will be 336kDa. A discussion on comparison of experimental and actual molecular weight would be interesting. hPANX1 was expressed in sf9 insect cells. A description regarding trials of expression of this construct in expi293 cells would be informative. Supplemental Figure 1B: The gel is overloaded and shows multiple bands for hPANX1, recommend selecting an alternative image for hPANX. Paragraph 6A phrase, “challenged with bezoylbenzoyl-ATP(bzATP), spironolactone and cabenoxolone ” - Please explain the meaning of ‘challenged’ here. Supplementary Figure 2: Paragraph 6 mentions “ binding constant could not be determined ”. Please provide an explanation for this. Is it about the saturation phase not being approachable because of the feasibility of the binding experiment at higher concentration of cabenoxolone? The last summary sentence in Paragraph 6 is not clear, recommend rephrasing it. Figure 2A shows that Salipro particles have His tag. This suggests that an additional step of affinity purification with His tag could have been used to distinguish or separate reconstituted and un-reconstituted PANX1. Supplementary figure 4: Please explain whether the datasets for samples in the presence and absence of fluorinated lipids were combined together. Paragraph 8, “ intracellular helices were not well resolved ” - Please comment on a possible explanation. Does the Salipro scaffold contribute to the resolution? Please mention any future possibilities regarding improving the resolution by modifying the salipro scaffold or alternative scaffold. In the same paragraph, rmsd is mentioned at promoter level, please comment on how this value changes at heptamer level and why is it important to report the rmdd value to appreciate the direct reconstitution methodology. Last paragraph 10, “future membrane protein research” - Please comment on the utility of this methodology on prokaryotic membrane proteins, bacterial outer or inner membrane proteins or eukaryotic membrane proteins. Some more examples of reconstitution with the same method will support the applicability of this methodology on diverse kinds of membrane proteins. A discussion section comparing this methodology to other methods would also be useful for readers.",2022-10-17T09:00:34,iratxepuebla,Iratxe Puebla,10.1101/2022.07.05.498330,Direct Cell Extraction of Membrane Proteins for Structure-Function Analysis,"Ieva Drulyte, Aspen Rene Gutgsell, Pilar Lloris-Garcerá, Michael Liss, Stefan Geschwindner, Mazdak Radjainia, Jens Frauenfeld, Robin Löving",2022-07-05
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.10.511625v1#comment-6014068497,biorxivstage,2,"In this preprint, Washburrne and colleagues put forth some reasoning and basic analysis that they believe suggests the viral genomic data from the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is consistent with a single spillover event. This is in contrast to the work of Pekar et al. 2022 Science, which concluded that the genomic data from the early pandemic is best explained by multiple independent spillover events from an animal population. However, this preprint misrepresents the findings of Pekar et al. 2022, and makes several conceptual errors that fundamentally undermine their conclusions. There are 4 basic features of the early SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny that are each largely inconsistent with a single spillover event: A Lineage A ancestral haplotype is inconsistent with the molecular clock: Lineage B exhibits more divergence from the root of the tree than would be expected if lineage A were the ancestral virus in humans (Pekar Fig S20, S19). Two basal polytomies of lineages A and B were formed at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, whereas most single introductions within a city, location, or event are characterized by a single polytomy. There are no plausible candidates for intermediate genomes observed for lineages A and B. Both Lineage A and Lineage B are connected to and were present during the outbreak at the Huanan Seafood Market, and there was sustained case transmission within the market for up to a month. The authors have *attempted* (unsuccessfully) to address points 2 and 3, but they have entirely ignored points 1 and 4, which are still highly pertinent. All four of these observations need to be explained by any hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 origins. Now, on to specific scientific errors in this work: 1. In the first section, the authors describe how superspreading events can create polytomies, as do introduction events. This is an intuitive observation, as both superspreading events and successful introductions can result from rapid transmission from a singular infection source. What they fail to note, however, is that superspreading events and introduction events are characterized by a single polytomy, not by two. Here is a simple list of introduction/superspreading events characterized by a single polytomy: New Zealand https://www.nature.com/arti... Lombardy https://www.nature.com/arti... Louisiana (Mardi Gras superspreading event) https://www.sciencedirect.c... Xinfadi market in Beijing https://academic.oup.com/ns... In none of the above cases of introduction/superspreader events do we observe two basal polytomies separated by two mutations with no intermediates as we do for early SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. Ironically, the authors cite Popa et al. 2020 Nature Communications on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria as an example of how polytomies can be linked to superspreader events. However, this work elegantly describes how each polytomy results from a separate introduction event into Austria: Vienna-1 clade/polytomy: connected to an index patient from Italy. Tyrrol-1 clade/polytomy: phylogenetically linked to North America. Vienna-3 clade/polytomy: connected to Cluster OG, an independent travel-associated cluster. Tyrrol-3 clade/polytomy: connected to Cluster D, an independent travel-associated cluster. So indeed, the cited work is actually more strong evidence that introduction events — including those of a ‘superspreader’ nature — are characterized by a single polytomy. We see no instances of a single superspreader event creating two concurrent polytomies, separated by two or more mutations, as we observe with the rise of lineages A and B in Wuhan. It is not merely the existence of polytomies in a phylogeny that is relevant, but the observed ratio of polytomy frequency and size, which Pekar et al. simulations predict would arise very infrequently with a single introduction. Further, the authors are incorrect in their characterization of the FAVITES models used by Pekar et al. FAVITES has been modified to accurately recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 superspreading nature; see Worobey et al. 2020 Science, Figure S2. Washburne et al. say: “and the transmission model of FAVITES will extend superspreading events over timescales that within-host evolution can occur”. However, the simulations in Pekar et al., 2022, and in FAVITES more broadly, account for within-host evolution: the coalescent process and subsequent mutational evolution are agnostic to subsampling and within-host evolution. 2. In the second section, the authors describe how ascertainment biases and biased contact tracing could affect the recovered phylogeny. The core conceptual errors here are namely: The lineage A/B split and the basal polytomies of SARS-CoV-2 are still obvious in any phylogeny of early SARS-CoV-2 even when excluding genomes from the city of Wuhan: this phylogenetic structure is factually not an artifact of sampling, and anyone is welcome to build a tree of sequences before April 2020 excluding those from Wuhan and demonstrate this. Likewise, lineage A is still incompatible with the molecular clock when genomes linked to the Huanan Market are excluded. Even in sequences from February 2020 can you see a ‘lag’ in the evolution of lineage A from its root compared to lineage B (Pekar Fig S20). The authors propose no explanation of how contact tracing of patients connected to one market could produce a phylogenetic artifact of two large, basal polytomies: indeed, their simple analysis in Fig 2 shows that contact tracing will preferentially sample just one lineage, not two. Small polytomies are common throughout the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. A contact tracing bias cannot explain a lack of intermediate genomes between lineages A and B into itself. Firstly, if the evolution between the lineages occurred in humans, the patients with intermediate genomes should be contact traceable from normal lineage B patients. Second, even if they were missed in Wuhan, we would see the phylogenetic descendents of the intermediate genotype spread to other countries, unless this lineage just happened to be wiped out very quickly. As discussed by the Worobey et al. 2021 Science perspective, several of the earliest known SARS-CoV-2 patients were emphatically not contact traced from others — they were independently noticed in different hospitals throughout the city. This includes the earliest known case of lineage A, who was not contact traced, and had no noted connection to the Huanan Seafood Market, but after the fact was realized to live just a few blocks away (and shopped at a nearby market). Several other data points that together point towards the known early case data in Wuhan not being strongly characterized by ascertainment bias are discussed in the supplementary text of Worobey et al. 2022 Science section on this topic. 3. In the third section, the authors put forth the possibility that several sampled genomes were intermediate sequences of lineage A and lineage B. Again here, they both misunderstand the data that they are reporting on, and misconstrue the methods and findings of Pekar et al. They propose that a set of genomes obtained from Sichuan may constitute C/C intermediate haplotypes between lineages A and B. However, the data does not support this, as elegantly explained by Zach Hensel on Twitter: https://twitter.com/alchemy... https://twitter.com/alchemy... Washburne writes: ""It is difficult to see how sequencing errors, which are random, could occur at exactly the same position in these 12 early outbreak genomes."" However, what they do not understand is that several of these genomes were plagued by systematic bioinformatics errors, not random sequencing errors. This was likely due to a known issue with a pipeline that imputed the reference genotype in loci with no read support, instead of replacing those positions with N characters. As demonstrated by Hensel above, for this particular dataset with poor coverage, that included the vast majority of samples which had no coverage at the relevant sites. Further, the authors misunderstand why certain genomes have been excluded from Pekar et al. The deciding observation is not the quality of the underlying sequencing data — although that is certainly likely the hidden cause — but the observation that some genomes share multiple polymorphisms with derived lineages in A and B, strongly indicating that they are phylogenetically aberrant. In all scenarios in which underlying data are available, it has been confirmed that these phylogenetic outliers are plagued by poor data quality issues, with missing data that has often been incorrectly imputed. In cases without the underlying data, the only alternative explanation would have to be a highly unusual degree of recurrent mutations. As this is fully explained in Pekar et al. 2022, I highly suggest the authors attempt a re-read to understand the reasoning of how we can identify these incorrect genomes. There are two more “minor” (in the grand scheme of things) errors in this section: “Lineage A and Lineage B, are separated by only two defining single nucleotide changes (SNCs), at positions 8782 and 21844” This is incorrect - the second position should be 28144, not 21844. This is wrong throughout the manuscript. ""Intermediate sequences suggest there may not be two basal polytomies"" Polytomies can be separated by a single mutation and still be polytomies: there is a basal polytomy in lineage A, and a separate basal polytomy in lineage B. The existence of intermediate genomes would not preclude the presence of these two polytomies. In sum, neither of the three points raised by Washburne and colleagues are in fact relevant to the hypothesis of multiple spillovers of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, it is also important to briefly discuss a broader conceptual error made by the authors. As they write: ""Far from being able to conclude two spillover events, both hypotheses - natural origin and lab origin - are still on the table."" This quote (along with knowledge of their past works) makes evident the aim of the authors: to reject the possibility of multiple SARS-CoV-2 spillovers because it is a finding largely inconsistent with their preferred laboratory origin hypothesis. They are correct in thinking that multiple spillovers of SARS-CoV-2 cannot easily be explained by a hypothesis of laboratory emergence. They are, however, incorrect in their statement that a lack of evidence for multiple spillovers would “put the lab origin hypothesis on the table”. There is an astounding degree of evidence against the possibility of laboratory emergence, primarily: (1) the complete lack of epidemiological contacts traced to the WIV, and the March 2020 seronegativity of Shi Zhengli’s group, (2) the geographic epicenter of the pandemic was in Hankou, Wuhan, not Wuchang, where the WIV resides, (3) the detailed insight we have into the research ongoing at the WIV in 2018-2019, including CoV sequences submitted to GenBank in 2018 (Yu Ping et al.) and Latinne et al. 2020 (submitted Oct 6 2019), multiple publicly available theses and papers, interviews, collaborator emails, US intelligence investigations, and unfunded grant proposals: all of which has so far indicated a lack of a SARS-CoV-2 progenitor at WIV, (4) the preponderance of evidence from the known early cases within the city of Wuhan, which were either linked to or centered around the Huanan Seafood Market, including the very first cases first identified in hospitals as reported by independent journalists as described in Worobey 2021 Science perspective, (5) the positive viral samples from an animal cage, a freezer, a defeathering machine, and the drains and ground of wildlife selling stalls within the western half of the Huanan Seafood Market, the half to which most human cases were also linked, and (6) direct and geographic links of patients and environmental sampling firmly establishing that both early SARS-CoV-2 lineages A and B were first identified in connection to the Huanan Seafood Market. Put otherwise, it is clear that the authors misrepresent and misunderstand the reasons why multiple spillovers have been proposed. Contrary to their beliefs, it is not to undermine or reject the laboratory hypothesis. The clear evidence against that hypothesis is well described in Holmes et al. 2021 Cell, The WHO Mission Report, and Worobey et al. 2022 Science— it is entirely incidental that the likelihood of multiple spillovers also happens to be inconsistent with their hypothesis. Why then has the possibility of multiple spillovers been proposed? Because the genomic data from the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is *peculiar*, and these peculiarities have so far only been adequately explained by models incorporating multiple spillovers. It is as simple as that.",2022-10-16T16:15:13,acc_account,Alex Crits-Christoph,10.1101/2022.10.10.511625,Statistical challenges for inferring multiple SARS-CoV-2 spillovers with early outbreak phylodynamics,"Alex Washburne, Adrian Jones, Daoyu Zhang, Yuri Deigin, Steven Quay, Steven E Massey",2022-10-13

I hope this will lead to better science and investigation into this phenomenon. If the goal was to attract attention with a provocative title and discussion, then you achieved this. Unfortunately the field of nitrogen fixation has a long history of claims of diazotorphy that have turned out to be false. So I hope you did not interpret my comments as doubting your expertise but more of a need for due diligence in a field with a bumpy history. I believe this manuscript and study need to be written in a way that will convince absolutely anyone with doubt. Therefore it does not hurt to be extremely specific when explaining the methods. For example, I commented on multiple-replatings because, as I read the methods, endophytes were isolated on nutrient agar and then directly plated on three different Glucose nitrogen-free media. Only on Page 4 line 23 do you describe “multiple generations” do you mean multiple transfers? If so, how many? And yes, I agree that if nitrogen contamination had been an issue, more of the isolates would have grown. I think this is important and should be stated in the manuscript. Again, to prove this phenomenon is real, I would suggest the most extreme caution and test with noble agar or agarose. It might also be helpful before this goes into an official review to repeat the growth on N-free media at a different facility just in case of contamination in water or other materials. Some bacteria can use ammonia from the air! So everything needs to be considered. ( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.j... For the N2 consumption assay, I think it would be communicated more clearly if the assay was reported in mol of N2/ min or hr/ mg of protein or colony-forming units to standardize and compare to other nitrogen-fixing organisms. Again, this will be doable without repeating the experiment if you have a standard curve. I am glad you measured the overall pressure change in each experiment, this should be stated in the methods. I think it might be beneficial to try with a majority argon atmosphere to see if a similar phenomenon occurs. It could test if the partial pressure of nitrogen affects the overall nitrogen fixation rate, suggesting if this is an enzymatic reaction with low Km. Also, a growth curve with nitrogen-free media in an argon atmosphere vs. N2 only atmosphere would be a compelling experiment. The comment that this dinitrogen consumption is occurring on ammonia-supplemented media might be a clue to what is happening. This is an exciting point that a constitutive process is consuming atmospheric dinitrogen in yeast. All known diazotrophs have a strict regulatory system to turn off nitrogen fixation when any fixed nitrogen is present. Therefore I believe it is essential to show the nitrogen-free assays as well. If you have the same nitrogen fixation rate in both ammonia-supplemented and nitrogen-free, this would be very interesting to determine what is limiting growth. All of these questions should be addressed in the manuscript. While we must think outside of prokaryotic nitrogen fixation, basic thermodynamics still apply. Therefore, no matter what, this reaction is highly energy intensive. From what I know, breaking the dinitrogen triple bond is the highest activation energy in biology. So I would fight back on the idea that this might not be a high energy-consuming process. This also brings questions to the previous observation of a constitutive reaction. In this topic, I also don’t want to discredit yeast and especially the peroxisomes. While I am no expert, I know some extreme chemistry goes on in peroxisomes, and the potential for dinitrogen to be oxidized to nitrite might be possible in them. Inorganic chemistry has shown oxidation of dinitrogen with a catalyst can happen, and we know life always finds a way! While I can easily google nitrogen fixation in yeast and get two papers from 1911 and 1954,  I can also easily google dozens of papers in he past 10 years that grow Saccharomyces cerevisiae under nitrogen limiting conditions. This is something you will have to justify in your manuscripts if you want to claim cerevisiae is using dinitrogen as its nitrogen source. For the PCR assay, I am just commenting on the gel itself and would hope to see a brighter band for the positive control. Also, it could be helpful once you get the Azotobacter strain to run nifH as another control to detect any prokaryotic diazotrophs. I hope to see you proceed with the N15 and the other controls. I would love to see a nitrogen-fixing eukaryote, but I am afraid it will require much more evidence for me to be convinced.

The results are really important specifically for rod-shaped bacteria and also an important contribution to the broader field of understanding cell shape. Specifically, I love that they are distinguishing between labile and non-labile intracellular magnesium pools, as well as extracellular magnesium! These three pools are really challenging to separate but I commend them on engaging with this topic and using it to provide alternative explanations for their observations! A major contribution to prior findings on the effects of magnesium is the author’s ability to visualize the number of septa in the elongating cells in the absence of magnesium. This is novel information and I think the field will benefit from the microscopy data shown here. I completely agree with the authors that we need to be more careful when using rich media such as LB. It is particularly sad that we may be missing really interesting biology because of that! It’s worth moving away from such media or at least being more careful about batch to batch variability. Batch to batch variability is not as well appreciated in microbiology as it is for growing other cell types (for example, mammalian cells and insect cells). For me, the most exciting finding was that a large part of the cell length changes within the first 10min after adding magnesium. The authors do speculate in the discussion that this is likely happening because of biophysical or enzymatic effects, and I hope they explore this further in the future! I love how the paper reads like a novel! Congratulations on a very well-written paper! Kudos to the authors for providing many alternative explanations for their results. It demonstrates critical thinking and an open-mind to finding the truth.

It would be helpful to have Western blot data showing that the particular proteins are actually being overexpressed. I think the phenotypes that you observe are very compelling, so I don’t doubt the conclusions. Western blot data would just provide some additional confirmation that you are actually achieving overexpression of UppS, MraY, and BcrC. Response The proteins are untagged. For the UppS and BcrC the cell shortening occurs with addition of inducer, , so strong indication expression is occurring. A western would provide information about degree of overexpression, but we don’t think is necessary to support conclusion drawn. Do you think there is an alternative possibility that needs to be excluded? We note that in another preprint ( https://www.biorxiv.org/con... the authors delete the native uppS in their inducible Phy-uppS strain (Fig S4) and at 100 uM IPTG (10X less than what we used in experiment) the cells have wt growth on LB plates, so we at least know the Phy-uppS is functional and made (or they would die!). We are introducing the uppS deletion into our strain to see if we can identify a concentration of IPTG that doesn’t affect cell growth but still induces shortening. For MraY, the result is negative, so you are spot on – it is impossible to tell if due to lack of overexpression from data shown. We only know the strain is correctly made from sequencing. We will investigate if there is an antibody or functional fusion available. The reason we were not sure was worth doing is because the MraY reaction is reversible (15131133). This means that without a phenotype, there is no simple way to know the reaction can even be pushed forward even if the overexpression is confirmed (more negative data). We actually overexpressed some other proteins that act downstream (MraY, MurJ, AmJ) and they were also negative for shortening. Probably we should remove the negative data or reword to make the caveats of the negative result clear. Question Based on your data, there are definitely differences in gene expression when you compare cells grown in media with and without magnesium. Because the majority in cell length increase occurs in such a short time though (the first 10min), I was wondering if you think that some or most of it is not due to gene expression? Response The shortening is even faster than 10 min (not only statistically significant, but also obvious qualitatively if we mount immediately after adding Mg2+ ). We did not include the first timepoint because original purpose was to check everything was ready with microscope – did not expect shortening so fast! We can definitely add that data in. When we saw, we tried to capture the transition on pads, but going from culture to pad seems to stress the cells too much in the small window where the cool stuff happens. Since growth rate doesn’t appear to be a big factor in those initial divisions, we might be able to grow at lower temp and shift to pads for adjustment period before adding Mg2+. Did not play with it much due to lack of resources atm, but a flowcell setup would probably be best. In short, we think rapid divisions right after transition do not require transcription or translation. It really “smells” more like a biophysical thing. Question Do you have any hypotheses what is most likely to be affected by magnesium? Do you think if the membrane may be affected? Response We have a lot of hypotheses – all of which are speculative. There could be an extracytoplasmic enzyme involved in envelope synthesis is sensitive to Mg2+ availability, and that at lower concentrations, it’s activity is affected. There is some old literature with membrane preps that suggests PG synthesis requires higher Mg2+ than teichoic acid synthesis. If Und-P is limiting, higher Mg2+ may shift make the pool more available to make the septum. Tingfeng initially hypothesized there might be a receptor/signal mechanism but has not been able to identify one. Und-P seems to be important, but “availability” is not just pool, but how fast (and where!) the flipping across the membrane occurs. If Und-PP needs to be dephosphorylated to Und-P before being flipped back to cytoplasmic side, anything that effects the PPi equilibrium would be predicted to affect the reaction rate, with lower Pi (in periplasm or pseudoperiplasm in case of G+) favoring the dephosphorylation. Cell wall associated Mg2+ could shift equilibrium to be more favorable for a Und-PP phosphatase more closely associated with the divisome. I could go all day… In short, we don’t know enough! Question Why do you think less magnesium activates this program of less division and more elongation? Additionally why is abundant magnesium activating a program of increased cell division and less elongation? Do you think there is some evolutionary advantage, especially considering how important magnesium is for ATP production? Response In the window we looked at, the elongation rate is constant (not less or more) and only the division frequency changes. Some bacteria (like Caulobacter and to lesser extent E. coli) clearly elongate and divide simultaneously, so there is some competition for substrate (like Lipid II). Septators like Bacillus seem to delineate the two processes more, but we have found conditions where even Bacillus invaginates during division, so it’s not absolute. Like eukaryotic cells, bacterial undoubtedly have mechanisms not only commit to a round of DNA replication when there is some signal that resources are sufficient. Clearly with some bugs, this is not the case with cell division. The alternative possibility is that every cell cycle there is an opportunity to divide if some threshold of *something(s)* is reached. There is a hypothesis from Mtb literature that it may be GTP, but it’s not at all clear that is sufficient. In yeast, size at cell division is affected by perturbing 1-C pool. Question Related to this previous question, I also wonder if this magnesium-dependent phenotype would extend to other unicellular organisms, may be protists or algae? That would be a really exciting direction to explore! Response It’s a great question – lots to do! We didn’t even look at another Gram-positive, but we plan to. It’s trickier to limit Mg2+ in Gram-negatives (see 27471053 – we tried Bsub homolog for those wondering – it’s not responsible for phenotype we see). Question Regarding the zinc and manganese experiments, why do you think they lead to additional phenotypes compared to magnesium? Do you have any hypotheses? Response We have hypotheses, but if my (Jen’s) twitter engagement is any indication, way too speculative for public consumption at present. Need grant to acquire preliminary data to write grant. Question Regarding your results that Lipid I availability may be a major a problem for the cell division in the absence of magnesium, do you think that is due to effects magnesium has on the enzymes directly, or do you think magnesium affects the substrate availability/conformation by coordinating the phosphate groups? Or something else, may be membrane conformation? Response Several proteins involved in envelope synthesis (like UppS) are Mg2+ dependent enzymes. But at least for any intracellular players, levels of Mg2+ should be more than high enough to support enzyme activity even when levels are low (0.8 – 3.0 mM is Bsub range I recall off top of head). Could have impact extracytoplasmically by lowering pool sponged into the cell wall, but intuition (for what that is worth) is that it is not the coordination of an enzyme with a metal that is impacted rather the equilibrium with other ions like Pi and H+ and that this impacts net ATP synthesis. Lots to think about and do, and no simple answers. When Tingfeng started project idea was to find mechanism – didn’t realize we were asking “how does the cell work?” Turned out to be a bit much for a dissertation project :) -Jen Herman and Tingfeng Guo",2022-10-13T19:16:01,bacillusbarosh,BacillusBaRosh,10.1101/2022.10.01.510448,Magnesium modulates Bacillus subtilis cell division frequency,"Tingfeng Guo, Jennifer K.

Do these seemingly contradictory results surprise you? Do you think there is something special about the nanobody structure that makes it a good replacement for the HMA domain in Pikm-1?
