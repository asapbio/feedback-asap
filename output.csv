They apply a newly-developed method to do so to a large cohort of individuals from the Estonian Biobank and find different contribution from ancestral populations on variants associated with pigmentation, anthropometric traits and blood cholesterol levels, among others. They also look at patterns of positive selection on a subset of these variants. The manuscript presents an interesting and extensive set of analyses informing on a fascinating question about the evolution of traits over time and adaptation, as well as the genetic make-up of trait variation in Estonia. The authors also introduce a useful statistic to measure these contributions. I detail some comments below that I think might help improve the text and analyses: - While covA is extensively explained in the Methods, it has too brief of a description in the beginning of the Results section, given its importance to the associated conclusions. I would dedicate a few more sentences to explaining the reasoning behind covA, before assuming that the reader will automatically know what one means as they continue reading the results. I was a bit confused at first as to what covA was exactly measuring, and I think it's a smart way of measuring ancestral contributions to traits, so a bit more motivation for its use would be useful. - I think it might be good to move the text describing the connection between covA and f-statistics to the Methods section, for people familiar with f-statistics to motivate its use this way. I also wouldn't say that ""covA(i,j) has no interpretation in terms of branch length because of the fictitious nature of pA, an allele frequency which only serves as balanced comparison for the ancestries under analysis"". After all, the ""populations"" used in f-statistics analysis are also artificial groupings of individuals that share more or less history, depending on the analysis at hand. - It might be useful to try to separate the Eastern Hunter-Gatherer and Caucasus Hunter-Gatherer  into 2 ancestral candidate groups, rather than treating Yamnaya as an ancestral source. EHG, CHG and WHG have quite differentiated component ancestries, so this might help solve some of the correlation issues mentioned at the bottom of page 3? See, e.g. Lazaridis et al. 2017. - The study would greatly benefit from examining the behavior of the covA statistic using simulations of a phenotype (say, in SLiM, see, for example, the recent preprints by Yair and Coop (2021) and Carlson et al. (2021)). The authors mention the interdependence inherent to the fact that the same reference populations are used, and I am concerned about what other factors might contribute to the behavior of the statistic, including, for example: 1) varying levels of negative selection operating on a trait, 2) the bias inherent to the fact that some ancestral populations might be closer to the present-day population on which the trait was measured, 3) effective size of the ancestral contributing population under study, 4) heterogeneity of the average ""reference"" populations used as baselines for comparison and 5) sample sizes of the ancestral populations (e.g. low sample size for the Siberians). - The authors say that ""those counties for which the covA distribution is significantly different than the rest of Estonia (two-tailed Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, p ≤0.001)."" It seems like a large number of counties have an asterik. I wonder if *all* counties would have an asterisk if one had chosen a more standard p-value cutoff? Why was this cutoff chosen? What would be the null sampling distribution here for what one would call significant? That each county would have the same distribution of this statistic as the whole country? - Following up on this, it seems a bit strange to say that one intends to control the pleiotropies that exist between traits by avoiding overly stringent multiple testing corrections as Bonferroni. Without an alternative way to control for multiple testing (e.g. FDR, or looking at genetic correlations between traits), I don't think the best course of action is to err on the side of anti-caution and go with a vanilla P-value cutoff designed for single tests. What does ""significance"" in this context tell one about the importance of different ancestral contributions? - I commend the authors for adding a city/countryside residency covariate in their model, to control for socio-economic effects. I wouldn't suggest, however, that this covariate allows one to entirely control for other socio-economic effects (for example, socioeconomic or cultural effects that might not be well explained by place of residence). This is a very hard problem and the subject of extensive research (see for example Mostafavi et al. 2020). Maybe add some cautionary statements along these lines? - I'd be happy to also share this review on other preprint peer review venues like Review Commons, PCI or Peerage of Science if the authors so desire.

Given the increasing importance of disseminating science through preprints, I want to help support research in drug development and metabolism by providing feedback and thoughts on preprints in these fields. Your preprint caught my eye, and I hope you will find the comments below useful. This is an interesting paper proposing a method to target ARID1A mutant cells through PLK1 inhibition. The authors also show evidence that this mechanism is independent of PLK1's canonical role as a mitotic kinase and identify/investigate a novel function of PLK1 in mitochondria using an unbiased approach. Overall, the authors’ claims are well supported by initial evidence and communicated effectively but could be strengthened with additional experiments. Although, who hasn’t heard this before… Although there appears to be a difference in sensitivity to volasertib in ARID1A knockout cells in two non-transformed and one transformed cell line via a single timepoint celltiterglo and colony formation assay, the fold change in inhibitor potency is modest (Figure 1C/E), and this evidence connecting PLK1 and ARID1A could be strengthened by 1) comparing the growth rate of ARID1A knockout and control cells. By considering differences in growth rate, the authors might find an overall greater difference in volasertib sensitivity between ARID1A KO versus control cells. 2) adding an additional 12-point dose-response curve to Figures 1C and E using a non-selective cytotoxin (i.e. paclitaxel) in ARID1A KO/control cells, 3) adding a dose-response curve using the known SWI/SNF mutant selective OxPhos complex I inhibitor IACS-010759 ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go.... As the authors find the underlying ARID1A vulnerability is mitochondrial in origin, IACS-010759 would be a useful control in other experiments throughout the paper as well. The second main conclusion, which leads the authors to conduct a CRISPR screen, is that PLK1 inhibition does not differentially alter cell cycle in ARID1A KO versus control cells. Although this is clearly novel, it is a hard pill to swallow given the literature on SWI/SNF and PLK1 regulating cell cycle, and the connection between mitochondria fusion and cell cycle progression. I urge the authors to conduct additional experiments here. For example, make sure that the pHH3 staining in ARID1A KO versus control cells treated with 10nM Volasertib (Figure 2C) is not significant, use additional concentrations of volasertib (dose response for functional assays) and further investigate cell cycle checkpoints/signaling. The authors could also show the results from Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for mitosis/cell cycle related genes in addition to Ox Phos/Reactive oxygen species in Figure 4H/I. Beyond Figure 2, it would be beneficial to verify the basal ECAR rates in addition to oxygen consumption in Figure 4J/6B, as the difference in oxygen consumption between ARID1A KO/Control cells is minimal in Figure 4J, and as the authors found that ATP production between these cells was not significantly altered. I would assume that ARID1A KO cells would have diminished glycolysis and the difference in ratio of OCR/ECAR may help distinguish the overall significance of the difference in mitochondrial metabolism between ARID1A KO and control cells. Also, there is a discrepancy between Figure 4J and Figure 6B. Seemingly both are showing oxygen consumption via seahorse assay in GES1-ARID1A KO versus control cells, but the difference is substantially greater in Figure 6B? Additional controls for measurement of membrane potential and ROS, for example various OxPhos inhibitors, would also help pinpoint how an increase in oxygen consumption (Figure 4J/6B) could be accompanied by a loss in membrane potential (Figure 3a-f). Another useful control throughout the paper would be to reconstitute the ARID1A KO cells with a functional ARID1A construct and verify the functional changes in mitochondria are rescued. The overall novelty of this paper is the role of PLK1 function and volasertib activity on mitochondria independent of cell cycle, and publication of these results could help shape the use of volasertib clinically, and our understanding of signaling between mitochondria and the nucleus. Although additional experiments would help substantiate the authors claims, the work is clearly important to communicate with basic researchers and clinicians looking at both mitochondria and cell cycle in relation to cancer, and this work helps solidify the functional relationship between these two fields.

I am writing to comment on the methods for tracking and analyzing Drosophila larvae. There are two most used methods so far. First, the multi-worm tracker (MWT) from Rex Kerr's lab initially developed for C. elegans (Swierczek et al. 2011) but then applied extensively to track populations of Drosophila larvae (e.g., Ohyama et al. 2013, Vogelstein et al. 2014, Ohyama et al. 2015, Jovanic et al. 2016, and more). Second, there's the system from Matthieu Louis' lab, Sensory Orientation Software (SOS; Gomez-Marin et al. 2012), which was used in subsequent projects (see [citations to that paper]( https://scholar.google.com/....

Maybe I missed something in the article, but I fail to see why one should expect differences in pLDDT to correlate with either changes in stability, or fluorescence. To my understanding,  changes in pLDDT can be either that the algorithm performs worse, or that the protein is predicted to be more disordered / flexible. My personal impression is that there is no robust rationale for expecting a priori  that pLDDT should strongly correlate with either stability, or fluorescence.

The authors identified that whole-body genetic deletion of LETMD1 promotes consistent reductions in mitochondrial structural and functional markers including reduced expression of mitochondrial proteins, low respiratory rates, and calcium ion levels. Such effects were paralleled to brown adipocyte whitening and accumulation of lipid droplets as well as systemic metabolic defects including impaired thermogenesis, cold intolerance, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, particularly under high fat diet. Although the results are very interesting and indicate that LETMD1 plays a role in regulating mitochondrial processes, the mechanistic bases underlying the systemic metabolic consequences caused by LETMD1 are not properly supported. Particularly, the relationship between mitochondrial Ca2+ and LETMD1 should be pursued by the authors to better substantiate the claim that systemic metabolic effects of LETMD1 KO results from altered mitochondrial Ca2+ and dynamics. Thus, I have observed some caveats and limitations of the present study as pointed out below, which authors might find useful to strength their conclusions. Major comments: 1)   The authors did not provide proper background literature to support the working hypothesis. For example, on the second paragraph of introduction, page 5, the authors state that “Interestingly, by analysis the expression profiles of LETMD1 in human and mice, we found that LETMD1 was highly expressed in the metabolism relative tissues, especially brown adipose tissue (BAT), and the expression of LETMD1 was significantly reduced in adipose tissues of the obese people and the high fat diet (HFD) induced mice.” I think this is a critical aspect to substantiate the studies on LETMD1 in adipose tissues. Alternatively, the authors should revise this paragraph clearly stating that background evidence is unpublished/preliminary. 2)   I have observed four important issues on the animal model used. First is which sub-strain of black 6 mice LETMD1KO were generated? Given that several sub-strains of black 6 are available, with distinct mutations that affect energy and redox metabolism ( https://www.nature.com/arti..., this is a crucial point that authors should clearly define. Second, the authors did not specify which sex and age were used throughout the work. Third, since the authors used a whole-body KO in their study, one might argue that factors released by tissues other than BAT generated by LETMD1 depletion might have caused the observed metabolic effects. This seems particularly important considering that LETMD1 is highly expressed in liver as well. Although this specific issue was not fully addressed, the authors should add a cautionary note at the discussion section, as well as balance their statements about the specific role of LETMD1 in BAT. Finally, since mice were maintained at 22oC which activates a thermogenic program ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... to maintain core body temperature, the authors should balance their findings to consider how LETMD1 deletion would affect metabolism at thermoneutral conditions. 3)   The authors should balance whether the observed whitening of BAT in LETMD1KO mice is a consequence of impaired brown adipocyte differentiation program or, a loss of mature brown adipocyte biomarkers. Specifically, given the strong and a consistent reduction in mitochondrial markers, one might think that either mitochondrial biogenesis is impaired or mitophagy is activated in LETMD1KO mice. Does LETMD1 deletion affect mitochondrial mass/content in other tissues/models? 4)   There is a clear trend towards increase in lipid droplets size in LETMD1KO even in chow diet, which might involve increased expansion of these structures due to improved association of mitochondria to lipid droplets. Indeed, recent evidence demonstrated that a population of mitochondria associates to lipid droplets in BAT to support lipid droplet expansion ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go.... It would be very interesting to see whether LETMD1 is differently located among mitochondrial populations in BAT and, if that is the case, then how LETMD1 contributes to lipogenesis and lipid droplet expansion. 5)   Considering that mitochondrial Ca2+ levels do not significantly rise upon adrenergic stimuli in LETMD1KO adipocytes, which mechanism mediates this effect? Since mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis is controlled by the calcium uniporter and NCLX activities ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih..., how LETMD1 regulate mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis through these targets? Since the metabolic effects of LETMD1KO in mitochondria involve an imbalance of Ca2+, and adrenergic stimuli cause a rise in Ca2+ levels, I think it would be very informative how LETMD1 deletion would affect respirometry of norepinephrine activated adipocytes. If LETMD1 negatively regulates NCLX expression/activity, then LETMD1 deletion would increase NCLX levels facilitating Ca2+ extrusion from mitochondria ultimately increasing respiratory rates. Also, as NCLX deletion promote adipocyte apoptosis ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih..., it is possible that LETMD1 deletion would render adipocytes more resistant to apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial permeability transition and limiting Ca2+ accumulation. Minor comments: 1)   The authors should carefully revise the writing to improve some sentences as the following example at page 4 “LETM1 was identified as a key component of ions transporter in mitochondria, including Ca2+/H+ transportation, K+/H+ exchange, Na+/Ca2+ exchange, and Mg2+ transportation to maintain the mitochondrial biology and cation homeostasis”.  Additional corrections should be made at: a)   the last paragraph of page 5 “Therefore, we hypothesize…”. b)   The first paragraph of page 6 “Mechanistically, our findings…”. 2)   The authors should better explain the different groups in graph legends. For example, in Figure 1C it is not known what the meanings of red and green bars are (which one is BAT and WAT?).",2021-09-29T17:05:51,disqus_IdVvoyU1Q9,Marcus Oliveira,10.1101/2020.11.18.388199,Deletion of Letmd1 leads to the disruption of mitochondrial function in brown adipose tissue,"Runjie Song, Yaqi Du, Peng Li, Huijiao Liu, Han Zheng, Xiaohui Lu, Shenghong Wang, Lijun Zhou, Nafis A Rahman, Sławomir Wołczyński, Adam Kretowski, Fazheng Ren, Xiru Li, Xiangdong Li",2020-11-20

As per the requirement of our course, we are forwarding to you the list of comments and questions we have regarding your work. To begin, we had a few questions and comments for Figures 1F and 1G.  We were curious as to why in Figure 1E you used PBS as a comparative control but the R. montanensis strain as your control for Figures 1F and 1G.  Additionally, it was not discussed whether the same or different mice were used for these figures.  Though we are assuming each timepoint represents different mice since exsanguination is typically lethal in mice.  If different mice were used to evaluate each timepoint then we believe that the two figures would be better represented as a bar graph rather than a line graph. Regarding your investigation into Caspases, we were curious if you spent any time looking at Caspase-5 activity?  Casp-5 can promote GSDMD activity as well. An important comment that many of us mutually agreed on was the lack of uninfected controls in your experiments.  Without uninfected controls, we find it difficult to fully accept the results you are proposing, as we have no idea how these differ from steady-state backgrounds.  We highly recommend that if you have this data, you import it somehow into your figures and discussion. We did have comments on figure arrangement, for while we appreciated Figure 1 and its establishment of the model you would use throughout the pre-print we thought that information was better suited for the supplementary rather than a “front-and-center” figure.  For example, it was agreed that information about the spleen size and titers in figure 1S would be more appropriate in place of some of the current figures in Figure 1. Additionally, we would’ve preferred to see Figures 3 and 5 combined in some manner, as they essentially answered the same question two different ways.  We don’t believe either needs to be excluded, but we do think that combining the two, or even placing Figures 3 and 5 consecutively, would give a clearer understanding of your results. There were a few visual comments we would like to mention as well.  While we appreciated the consistency throughout the pre-print, some members did mention that red and green are difficult to differentiate in grayscale prints and suggested instead using patterned lines or symbol changes to help strain differentiation.  Especially given that Red/Green colorblindness is very common.  Many of us also expressed concern over the size of certain figures.  Figures like 2D and 3J were so crowded it was difficult to see which condition was which without blowing up the image. Personally, I was very happy to see that you had included a figure at the end of your preprint visualizing the process you believe determines whether a Rickettsiae spp. will be virulence or not.  However, we were not very fond of the layout.  It took a moment to piece the figure together even though we knew well what each step represented as the delineation between what was pathogenic and what was apathogenic was not super clear.  We would recommend you make this separation clearer by separating the failed and successful host colonization pathways. I wish to preface this paragraph by mentioning that none of us within the journal club are experts in vesicles or phagocytosis.  However, we were all extremely confused with Figure 4.  We have no qualms against your use of fluorescence microscopy.  In fact, most of us agree that this was a necessary and powerful inclusion.  But the figures were not well discussed in the body of the text.  A lot of personal googling was necessary to understand why you were targeting what you were and even then, we still had questions.  For example, why were you targeting LC3B and EF-Ts, and which one corresponds to the actual bacteria?  I personally was very excited for this portion of the paper but felt a little disappointed about the lack of sense I could make from the figures.  Overall, we think this figure has a lot of potential, but that a robust description is necessary to gain a full understanding. Our last comment is by far the most important.  We wouldn’t have noticed had we not had the images blown up as we did, but we have concerns regarding Figure 4E and strongly recommend you check your graphing software.  We noticed that the bars for ATG5fl/fl + R. typhi and ATG5fl/fl-LysM + R. typhi were shifted slightly below the baseline of the graph.  We are optimistic that this is a simple mistake in your editing software, but our groups often use Prism and have not seen these kinds of graphical artifacts before.  Therefore, we strongly recommend that you look over this figure again in your editing software to correct this mistake. Overall, we really enjoyed reading your preprint and think that with a few adjustments and deeper discussions that this article could be very successful.  We thought your transcript was well written and greatly appreciated how thorough your group was with explaining how you got to each investigative point.

We had a quick look at genes in the molecular functions mentioned in your preprint and their expression seems to also be unevenly distributed in the fat body Fly Cell Atlas data. From our quick look it also seems that they are enriched in different populations of fat body cells which mostly do not overlap with the ones in which we see enriched expression of fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation genes. It is great to see that our two studies come to similar conclusions and highlights how much we still have to learn on tissue and metabolic organization. If you are interested you can have a look at your genes of interest by following the links in the “Data portals” section of the Fly Cell Atlas webpage ( https://flycellatlas.org/).,2021-09-27T15:15:22,CRfly,Carlos Ribeiro,10.1101/2021.07.04.451050,Fly Cell Atlas: a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the adult fruit fly,"Hongjie Li, Jasper Janssens, Maxime De Waegeneer, Sai Saroja Kolluru, Kristofer Davie, Vincent Gardeux, Wouter Saelens, Fabrice David, Maria Brbić, Jure Leskovec, Colleen N.

Importantly, this work adds to the growing body of evidence that nuclear capsids are largely intact (Burdick et al. 2020; Dharan et al. 2020; Selyutina et al. 2020; Zila et al. 2021; Müller et al. 2021, Li et al. 2021; and others). However, for two reasons, we respectfully disagree with the conclusion that the “…HIV-1*CA14SiR represents a substantial improvement compared to previous genetic labeling strategies (Campbell et al. 2008; Burdick et al. 2020; Zurnic Bönisch et al. 2020; Pereira et al. 2011).”  First, like HIV-1*CA14SiR, the infectivity of virus labeled with GFP-CA as we described (1:15 ratio of GFP-CA:WT Gag) was modestly reduced 2-fold (Fig. 1B in Burdick et al. 2020), indicating that the GFP-CA labeling system does not severely reduce virus infectivity compared to the HIV-1*CA14SiR system.  Second, given the “minimally invasive” strategy used to label HIV-1 CA, it was surprising that the nuclear import of capsids containing CA14SiR was severely delayed by 6-12 hours (Fig. 3; Schifferdecker et al.).  In contrast, we showed that GFP-CA labeling of virions did not affect nuclear import kinetics of capsids (Fig. 2H in Burdick et al. 2020). It is not clear why the CA14SiR labeling has such a drastic effect on nuclear import kinetics; labeling most of the CA in the capsid shell with the fluorescent dye may alter the capsid structure and stability, influencing the timing of nuclear import as well as other capsid functions, such as PF74-induced disassembly.  We believe it is important to show that the labeling method does not have a significant influence on the steps in HIV-1 replication that are being investigated.  For this reason, we showed that GFP-CA labeling of virions did not affect the timing of loss of sensitivity to capsid inhibitor PF74 (Fig. 2G), timing of reporter gene expression (Fig. S1L), sensitivity to various HIV-1 inhibitors (Fig. S1M), capsid stability (Fig. S1E-F), association of capsids with nuclear envelope (Fig. S1G), nuclear import efficiency (Fig. S1G), and binding of nuclear capsids to CPSF6 (Fig. S4H-I; all figures in Burdick et al. 2020).

In the modified FLASH-seq protocol with a UMI-containing TSO, we do use separate PCR primers! We follow the advice given by the Authors of the Smart-seq3 paper and add 0.5 uM final F-primer to outcompete the leftover (unreacted) TSO after RT, exactly for that purpose: avoid over-inflating the UMI-count. We realised also that this part is not properly described in the Methods section and that, in general, so many variations of the basic protocol create some confusion. We are finalising detailed protocols and we hope to upload them on Protocols.io in the next few weeks.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.20.457089v1#comment-5541529163,biorxivstage,2,"This preprint was presented at our lab journal club and we thought we’d start an open discussion about these results. We would first like to note that it was a pleasure to discuss the results in this paper, which we found rather interesting, and we had a very fruitful discussion. Nevertheless, we had several questions and clarifications that we were hoping you would be able to help resolve: 1. Could you please describe a bit more in detail how exactly bouts are defined and how bursts and bouts are distinguished from one another in the processed VNR signal? Is there an interbout interval threshold set to separate bouts, for instance? If yes, what was the value used? 2. Proof of the idea of measuring conduction velocities using voltage imaging is neat. However, is there some validation of the conduction velocities, as measured by the sub-Nyquist interpolated spike timing (SNAPT) method? For instance, can you compare measurements of conduction velocity by this method with, say, measurements from dual recordings with downstream partners to compare the delay between activation of a cell and the arrival of a PSC? It is not perfect, of course, but given that actually recording from dendrites etc is so challenging in small preps like larval zebrafish, it would be a useful reference value for comparison of how accurate the SNAPT measurements are. 3. The analysis of Figure 4 involves sorting bouts as those having >50% of active V3. This is a rather arbitrary classification, especially since there aren’t too many neurons per field of view so the difference between 40% and 60% might be just one neuron or so. Why not go the other way around, and first classify bouts as strong/weak and then ask what fraction of V3s was active, across all trials, by plotting bout strength against % of V3 active as a scatter plot? Moreover, we have some concerns with the definition of bout strength. Taking the average cumulative value as the bout strength doesn’t really capture the true bout strength, in our view, since it only captures amplitude, and not so much duration. In Fig 4A (bottom), for instance, bout #2 looks much weaker than bout #7 (which is longer). Yet, their computed “bout strength” is very similar. Why not use Area Under the Curve as a proxy for bout strength? It would capture both amplitude and duration in the definition of “strength”. This analysis may not change the results or the overall story, but is a more objective way of analysing the data, we think. 4. From the representative plots shown in Fig 5C and D, it seems that when V3 neurons’ activation is turned off, the bout ends. Yet, from the earlier figures, it seems that V3 activity is sustained even after a bout ends. Is it possible with the resources available to perform acute inhibition of these neurons during a bout, to test if shutting their activity suppresses swims? It would lend support to the hypothesis that V3 activity sustains bouts? 5. The switch to free swimming with optomotor response for the experiment in Fig 6 wasn’t very clear. Moreover, we don’t agree with the interpretation of the result about bout speed modulation in Fig 6C. From the raw data points, the distributions seem largely overlapping, and the difference being detected may simply be because of the large difference in the sample sizes between the control and the ablated groups. Also, how about doing the ablation experiment using the same paradigm as in Fig 5? That way, results may be easier to compare. Furthermore, it is interesting that there is no difference in bout durations in vivo with V3 ablation, although all previous experiments suggest that one should expect a reduction in bout duration on V3 ablation. This may be because of functional compensation/adaptation because of a genetic ablation of V3 neurons from birth. Hence, it may be better to perform acute inhibition in the V3 population during free-swimming OMR, provided you have lines to do the same. Other general comments: 1. Could the legends please include all n’s, as appropriate? Some legends have it, others don’t. It would make the reading much easier. 2. Fig 1G and Supplementary Fig 3  - clarify the dorsoventral axis schematic. What does 0-1 mean - as in, which is ventral and which dorsal? I think 1 would be ventral, given that active motor interneurons seem to be positioned that way, but a clarification is needed and would make the figure easier to interpret. 3. Could you please describe the filters being used in a bit more detail, instead of simply stating “high-pass filtered”? What filter type was used (Butterworth, etc.)? What were the cutoff frequencies (sometimes time constants are mentioned, but it would be better to be consistent in the reporting of these details)? 4. In the introduction, it is stated that “adapting motor output can also happen via changes in tail amplitude or force, without substantial changes in frequency.” Recent work from our lab - Jha and Thirumalai (Current Biology, 2020) - has supported this claim, and we have also shown using whole-cell recordings that this can be explained by changes in the intrinsic properties and recruitment of primary motor neurons at lower speeds. We hope you go through our paper and find it useful, in which case a citation of our work would be much appreciated. We hope you find some of our comments useful, and we eagerly look forward to hearing back from you. Thanks in advance.

However, I have several concerns (or misunderstanding). First in the method, it is not clear how the authors measured their effects. Did they stimulate n times the TS with and without UV illumination and/or drug treatments, or only once ? In the latter case, as suggested by the use of a paired t-test, the expected variability from trial to trial may have obscured the outcome. Second, the authors are surely aware that KV4 current are strongly inactivated at rest and that the window current amounts at best 10% of the full conductance (our work (Vincent and Tell, 1997; Strube et al., 2015). In addition, the recovery tau of inactivation is about 80 ms (from 20 to 140) at -100 mV (junction potential corrected (Strube et al., 2015). This means that the full recovery needs a three times more duration. We may thus expect that Gaba Epsp may be too weak to de-inactivate sufficiently KV4 channels. On figure one, the inhibitory synaptic barrage hardly reach -5 mV for one second. Given that the resting potential is about -60 mV, the potential reached during inhibition would be -65 mV. It should come as a surprise that this tiny de- inactivation of KV4 was unseen. In addition, shifting the resting potential to more negative value would reduce the window current ((Strube et al., 2015). BTW, the authors did not observe a change in resting potential after blocking KV4 channels, arguing against a strong window current at rest. We know that EPSPs are certainly stronger at synaptic sites. According to the Nersnt’s equilibrium, the Ecl- is about – 90 mv but the amplitude of the observed EPSPs do not suggest that hyperpolarization to be such large at synaptic sites. p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 115%; background: transparent }",2021-09-17T09:57:13,disqus_XAwkux9CPS,TELL,10.1101/2021.09.14.460273,GABA and IA Independently Regulate rNST Responses to Afferent Input,"Z.

Members of the Mullins laboratory read this paper together and discussed it during a recent journal club meeting. Following the meeting, we drafted the following set of comment with the aim of helping the authors revise the work for final publication.. Briefly, this manuscript describes in vitro and live-cell experiments aimed at understanding the connection between intermediate filaments and the actin cytoskeleton. As the authors note, this is an understudied topic, with many fundamental unanswered questions. The experiments described in the paper employ a variety of approaches, including rheometry, fluorescence microscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy. The major results claimed by the authors include evidence for extensive interactions between vimentin IF and actin cytoskeletal systems in the cell periphery and effects of IF networks on actin monomer diffusion. Specific comments/concerns: 1. In the Introduction the authors state that it is “...generally thought that F-actin and VIFs form two co-existing but separate networks.” This is not an entirely fair description of the field. There is a significant body of work on interactions between intermediate filaments and elements of the actin cytoskeleton [e.g. myosin II/IF interactions described in Svitkina et al. (1996). J Cell Biol 135(4):991-1007], and how the actin cytoskeleton can regulate IF network architecture [e.g. this review by Chang and Goldman (2004). Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 5(8):601-13; and numerous research papers, including Schoumacher et al. (2010) J Cell Biol. 189(3):541-56 and Serres et al. (2020) Dev Cell. 52(2):210-222]. A more inclusive discussion of previous work on the interaction of the two cytoskeletal components would improve the presentation. 2. The title mentions the cell cortex, but there is almost no mention of the cortex per se in the Results or Discussion. 3. The figure captions should contain more experimental details. For example, captions should contain information on cell types, microscopy methods, and molecular probes (e.g. is the actin in Figure 1 phalloidin stained?). They should also contain other relevant details, such as buffer conditions, temperatures, and how many times an experiment was repeated. 4. The authors should consider combining Figure 1 and 2. It is a little unclear what is being highlighted by the arrows in Figure 1, as the two networks appear to be quite separate, even in this region of the cell. Figure 2 makes a better case for overlapping network elements. 5. In Figure 2, it is unclear whether the two networks are actually interpenetrating or simply present in different focal planes. Because the raw data includes z-stacks, it would be useful to show an XZ or YZ or 3d projection of the data. 6. Figure 2 should contain some (even rough) quantification of the percentage of observed cells that displayed such unambiguously interpenetrating networks. 7. The electron microscopy in Figure 3 is beautiful and quite convincing. The minimum distance argument, however, does not rule out the possibility that the actin and intermediate filaments are linked by plectins. The crosslinks could be present in areas where the filaments are further apart. Also, to convince the reader that they can distinguish between filaments based on width, the authors should provide a histogram of all the observed filament widths. Does the histogram show a clear bimodal distribution? 8. For Figure 4, please cite some previous studies using this indenter method and/or provide further details on the method: does it apply uniaxial or isometric stretch? Some raw images before, during, and after stretching would be more useful than the recovery plot shown in B. 9. As noted above the caption (or description) of Figures 4&5 should contain the number of biological replicates. P values calculated with n=number of cells (rather than the number of replicates) are not appropriate. We recommend simply removing the P value calculations. 10. Unfortunately, the data presented in Figure 5 are not convincing: a. Firstly, P values calculated on the number of cells instead of the number of biological replicates are artificially small and should not be reported. The trend is intriguing, but does it hold up over multiple rounds of experiment? b. Secondly, the FRAP bleaches both monomers and filaments. To look at only monomers, a method like FCS would be better. c. Instead of the curves in B, raw images would be more informative. d. When vimentin is knocked out, does the rest of the cytoskeleton change to compensate? Currently the explanation for these results is that there could be direct protein-protein interactions between Vimentin and G-actin which affect G-actin diffusion. The author favored this over the model where G-actin diffusion is limited by physical/steric obstruction of Vimentin networks. However the current data is unable to fully delineate these two models as the Y117L mutant forms a sort of intermediate filament (“intermediate” in length relative to the long filament), which intuitively could physically obstruct G-actin diffusion in an intermediate fashion (which is observed by this experiment). Perhaps using another mutant form of Vimentin that is simply unable to form any filaments but is present in cellular protrusions could help clarify the mechanism of G-actin diffusion limiting. 11. It is unclear what precisely the reader is to take away from Figure 6. The concentration of actin filaments is so high that one cannot make out individual filaments or their interactions with vimentin. It does not seem very surprising that two proteins can polymerize in the presence of one another. Is the point mainly that these two proteins can mix? Are there examples of the literature of other filament-forming protein phase separating from actin, or other conditions where this mixing doesn’t occur? A negative control would make this data more convincing.",2021-09-16T22:05:04,dychemullins,Dyche Mullins,10.1101/2021.07.29.454155,Vimentin Intermediate Filaments and Filamentous Actin Form Unexpected Interpenetrating Networks That Redefine the Cell Cortex,"Huayin Wu, Yinan Shen, Suganya Sivagurunathan, Miriam Sarah Weber, Stephen A.

In current study, using unbiased lipidomics and proteomics, the authors showed that the embryonic lethality in mice lacking the fluidity regulators Adiponectin Receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1/2) is associated with aberrant high saturation of the membrane phospholipids. Using MEFs derived from AdipoR1/2-KO embryos, human cell lines and the model organism C. elegans the authors found that, mechanistically, AdipoR1/2-derived sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signals in parallel through S1PR3-SREBP1 and PPARγ to sustain the expression of the fatty acid desaturase SCD and maintain membrane properties. They concluded that an evolutionary conserved pathway by which cells and organism maintain membrane homeostasis and adapt to a variable environment.

The topic and the questions it raises are fascinating and definitely needed to be addressed. I have few comments about method details that were absent from the manuscript, and that you may consider adding: -You refer to the original publication by Bubly et al for the breeding methods of the different selection regimes you used (which is fine), but in this publication we have no information on parameters that can influence the microbiota. For instance, you could give some details about the opportunities for microorganisms to jump from one generation to the next (only through egg chorion? Adults could defecate in the bottle for next generation? Etc.). You could also mention the food composition and if preservatives were used (they both strongly affect the microbiota) -I missed the details of the collection of your different flies. You only indicated you sampled 20 individuals in each population or each selection regime, but we do not know if those individuals were collected 1) after the stress in a “selection generation”, 2) during the “no selection” generation, or 3) after x generations bred in identical conditions. You mention “common garden” in the abstract and in the conclusion, but there is no mention of this in the methods… Also, additional parameters such as the age of the flies, time spent in the same bottle etc. do affect a lot the microbiota composition -By not eliminating parental effects (like transgenerational transmission of microbiota), one potential issue is to measure the filtering effect of the treatment directly on bacteria rather than on the fly-microtiota system (or holobiont). This is something important, weakening the ""holobiont"" aspects of your discussion, and that you should discuss in my opinion. A way to test that would have been to eliminate the microbiota of the flies, and let all lines grow with the same starting microbiota. In such case, still observing different communities would indeed indicate co-evolution at the holobiont scale. I understand these flies were collected a while ago, probably without this experiment in mind, but you have to acknowledge the limits of your experimental setup. Hope you will find my suggestions relevant. I much enjoyed reading this paper and this is why I wanted to point out some potential issues.

The manuscript could benefit from a direct comparison with published protocols and proper literature reference. Specifically: 1)     The authors claim that the culture protocol described presents “unprecedented access to peri-implantation development”. However, this protocol is not directly compared with previously published protocols(Bedzhov and Zernicka-Goetz, 2014,Cell, 156, 1032-1044) which have been used extensively to study mouse peri-implantation development. This comparison seems essential to uncover the unique characteristics and advantages of the protocol for ex-vivo embryo culture presented in this study. 2)     The authors claim that their protocol provides a unique opportunity to study the contribution of the morphogenesis of extraembryonic tissues to peri-implantation development. Yet previous studies using alternative approaches have already provided great detail about the role of extraembryonic tissue behaviour during peri-implantation development and their impact on embryonic tissues morphogenesis and embryo shape acquisition. Specifically: a)     Christodoulou et al., 2018 Nat Cell Biol 20:1278, describes ExE apical constriction and ExE invagination during egg-cylinder formation. b)     Christodoulou et al., Nat Comms 2019 10: 3557 describes the impact of ExE morphogenesis on Epiblast and Visceral endoderm positioning during egg-cylinder shape acquisition. c)     Weberling A & Zernicka-Goetz M. Cell Rep. 2021 34:10865 study reveals that ExE morphogenesis is necessary for proper epiblast morphogenesis. d)     Dokmegang et al 2021 PLoS One.16:e0254763 study uses computational modelling to show that ExE morphogenesis dictates epiblast development. e)     Ueda et al Cell Rep. 2020 31:107637 study shows that the Reichert’s membrane, produced by mTE cells, is necessary for egg-cylinder morphogenesis by protecting the embryo from intrauterine pressures. The findings of these studies are partially cited and in some cases and not cited at all in other cases (Weberling A & Zernicka-Goetz M. Cell Rep. 2021 34:10865, Dokmegang et al 2021 PLoS One.16:e0254763, Ueda et al Cell Rep. 2020 31:107637). The findings of these studies should be correctly referred to and discussed by the authors in the revised version of the manuscript. I hope that the authors find these comments helpful.
