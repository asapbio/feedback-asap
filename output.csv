Very valid concern - I did use the 10x prefiltered gtf file as a starting point as most users probably use that as the default option. So all improvements are made based on the latest 10x Genomics default human and mouse genome annotations/reference transcriptomes. Will clarify that in the Methods.,2022-05-13T19:06:36,allanhermannpool,Allan-Hermann Pool,10.1101/2022.04.26.489449,Enhanced recovery of single-cell RNA-sequencing reads for missing gene expression data,"Allan-Hermann Pool, Helen Poldsam, Sisi Chen, Matt Thomson, Yuki Oka",2022-04-27

Depositing our code in a permanent repository is a great idea -- we will look into that further. Here are some other thoughts on your questions: - Would you be interested in trying out your method in our 2021 data with spatially-adjacent replicates? Yes absolutely! - How far can you go in µm? We have some replicates 300 µm apart It's hard to give an answer that's universally true across all tissue types, as it depends a lot on the ""frequency"" of spatial variation along that axis. That said, we would love to take a further look at the data you mentioned to see if it's 300 µm is doable. - Can you combine H&E + smFISH images? Yes in theory it shouldn't be a problem with our model, although we haven't tried it in practice. - For the future studies that you described, what contingencies are you considering for cases where an intermediate tissue slide has a technical problem like tissue folding? Great question. We're hoping to allow for more human-in-the-loop involvement so users can interfere if there's a known issue. In some cases, the model may be able to correct for large technical distortions, like folds, in a data-driven way, although it may also be useful to consider ways to automatically detect common types of technical issues.",2022-05-12T20:18:41,disqus_POAHSjWgm0,Andy Jones,10.1101/2022.01.10.475692,Alignment of spatial genomics and histology data using deep Gaussian processes,"Andrew Jones, F.

Also Dr. Lobrich implicitly suggests that all the biochemical assays done with recombinant Rad54 by many labs, including his own collaborator  Heyer on this paper, are worthless. We will be happy to provide any lab with our pRad54-S572 antiserum for reproduction of our results, unlike the antiserum from Lobrich's lab which cannot be distributed for any such studies.",2022-05-12T16:44:21,disqus_WnE77KbuBm,Arrigo Debenedetti,10.1101/2022.04.01.486731,Evidence that Nek1 does not phosphorylate Rad54-S572 during recovery from IR,"Ishita Ghosh, Md Imtiaz Khalil, Arrigo De Benedetti",2022-05-05

Given some of my research projects, I'll need to read in detail your pre-print as I find it very interesting. That's why I made a feature request (FR) on GitHub asking for a documentation website or information on how to use GPSA https://github.com/andrewch.... I might have missed it, and look forward to further interacting with you. As you are likely acutely aware, sometimes testing software in a different computational system or dataset might reveal some bugs or potential new feature requests. I recognized that you have implemented a GitHub Actions workflow and automatically test your software https://github.com/andrewch... on Python 3.8, which is formidable. As I'm a Python novice, I don't know if there's an equivalent to covr in R ( https://CRAN.R-project.org/... for code coverage. On the pre-print itself, I greatly appreciate how you've shared all appendixes, and in particular, I love sections 6.1 and 6.2 where you described where you got the datasets you analyzed and link to the code you used, respectively. I would further encourage you to deposit your code at a permanent repository like Zenodo or Figshare (or even bioRxiv) since code can be deleted from GitHub.  You'll get a DOI that you can cite in an update pre-print or peer-reviewed version of your manuscript. While I'll need external help and/or quite a bit of time to understand your mathematical models, I also like how you have described it in detail. I'll repeat here (and edit) some of my questions I asked publicly on Twitter & live during Andrew Jones' talk at #BoG22: * Would you be interested in trying out your method in our 2021 data with spatially-adjacent replicates? * How far can you go in µm? We have some replicates 300 µm apart. (Jean Fan from JHU BME asked the same question framing it as a Z-axis distance question). * Can you combine H&E + smFISH images? * For the future studies that you described, what contingencies are you considering for cases where an intermediate tissue slide has a technical problem like tissue folding? I recognize that these questions are beyond the code of this pre-print and will likely be answered elsewhere. If it helps, we would be happy to chat with you about our data we have publicly available and some that we are also generating. Best, Leonardo",2022-05-12T15:43:02,fellgernon,L.

In a lot of cases we find that GPSA's alignments are good even with a small subset of the genes. In fact, sometimes we find it helps to filter out genes that don't show much spatial variability/autocorrelation because these don't help spatial alignment. It's tough to give an exact minimum number of genes/read counts needed because it varies across tissue type and profiling technology, but in some cases alignment is still quite good with ~30 highly spatially variable genes. Would be interesting to test this on MERFISH/CosMx data too.",2022-05-12T15:31:59,disqus_POAHSjWgm0,Andy Jones,10.1101/2022.01.10.475692,Alignment of spatial genomics and histology data using deep Gaussian processes,"Andrew Jones, F.

I noticed that no data was shared at the pre-print stage, though you have promised that it'll be shared by publication time on the ""Data Availability"" section. That is a bummer: we have an example where we shared the data at the pre-print stage in Feb 2020, another method used it in October 2020 for their pre-print, which accelerated since our published version appeared in February 2021. While I recognize that with a large team, coordinating when to release data is tricky, I would encourage you to share data at the pre-print stage in the future. I'd be happy to chat with you in more detail about the advantages of open science: you are on that route already by having a pre-print and participating in the bioRxiv commentathon trial. On a similar theme, I greatly appreciate that you have stated specific version numbers of the software you used. That's really useful as software changes frequently, particularly in frontier fields like yours. It's great to see GitHub links to the software pipelines that were developed as part of this project. However, code on GitHub is not permanent. Are you considering depositing the code at Zenodo, Figshare or other permanent code repository where you'll get a DOI? In addition, ultimately code is the final documentation for what you did. I might have missed it, but I don't see a repository for the actual code used for this project (and it's DOI), only for the software pipelines. That code will be useful to see since you might have used non-default parameters which can greatly influence the results. Thank you! Leonardo",2022-05-12T15:05:36,fellgernon,L.

I am curious if you did any experiments looking at how the accuracy of the model changes with sparsity in the real data, i.e. how many spatially variable genes are necessary to achieve a good alignment in the Slide-seq hippocampus or cerebellum?

Ghosh, Khalil and Benedetti reports that NEK1 does not phosphorylate RAD54 under conditions that are described to replicate the conditions of Fig. 3B of our publication Spies et al. 2016, Molecular Cell. However, this description is factually incorrect as the study by Drs. Ghosh, Khalil and Benedetti used recombinant RAD54 while our experiment in Fig. 3B used RAD54 immunoprecipitated from cells. This is a very important difference, as we also observed and reported in Spies et al. 2016 that recombinant RAD54 WT and mutant proteins do not recapitulate the in vivo findings. Thus, the new data by Drs. Ghosh, Khalil and Benedetti are consistent with and not contradicting the published results. One possible explanantion for the difference between in vivo RAD54 and recombinant RAD54 is that the latter lacks additional post-translational modifications needed to fully recapitulate the in vivo situation. In addition, the post by Dr. Benedetti and colleagues does not include validation studies of the modification-specific anti-serum that was commissioned for their study and lacks important controls such as the dependence of the signal on RAD54 and the Serine572 residue of RAD54. The post has not undergone the rigors of peer review, unlike Spies et al. 2016, for which the mentioned validation and controls are presented in Figs. 3C and 3D. In follow-up studies, we generated mice with a RAD54-S572A phospho-mutation. This mutant exhibits a homologous recombination (HR) defect which is epistatic to that of NEK1-deficient mice. Moreover, a phospho-mimic RAD54-S572E mutant is proficient in HR and over-rides the defect of NEK1-deficient cells. These new physiological data fully support our finding that NEK1 exerts its function during HR via this phosphorylation site of RAD54.

For scran it is my understanding that the 'scoreMarkers' function is now the recommended method for marker gene detection. See Chapter 6 in Orchestrating Single Cell Analysis. Instead of using the old wilcoxon/binomial/t-test methods in 'findMarkers' it uses three similar but alterative algorithms: Cohen's d, AUC, and 'detected'.

Essential comments: - It would be great to analyze other DNA methylation datasets (not only blood) to approve your view at more systemic level. - Equation 1 describes a behavior of particular CpG sites which was hypothesized in your study. However, today we have rather many single cell DNA methylation datasets. You could use them to approve your ideas more rigorously. - Probably I missed, but I didn't found an explanation why PC2 was excluded from the analysis?

For the first version, I commented that the consortium's belief that macroevolution can be viewed in the same terms as microevolution has long been challenged by those with a deep understanding of molecular biology, chromosomal cytology, and history. Indeed, an apparent neutrality of mutations ""constantly raining down"" in proximate generations can set the stage for natural selection to act in distal generations (i.e., generate a ""cryptic population structure"" with an ""absence of gene flow"" facilitating non-blending inheritance). Here there may be opportunities for differentiation into independent species ( speciation), which can respond in new ways to environmental challenges. In the revised version the consortium continues to cite Provine's 1971 first edition, not his updated 2001 second edition.

The authors state that there are as few as seven SNPs in one dataset. How could this address research questions discussed for Dipodomys elator in this paper? Is there a larger set of SNPs, and if so where are the different data being used in the results? The principal component (PC) analysis indicates that 98% of the variation in the data set is explained by the first PC and then the authors use the small amount in the second PC to explain some population structure. I have worked with PC analysis (A) many times and never saw one with loadings like this. This PCA must be explained as “anon anon” indicated. And, in addition to a PCA like I have never seen, the authors discuss using STRUCTURE, but do not include the graph in this preprint material. Why? I think it must be added to the preprint. After reading the study by Pfau et al., mentioned by “anon anon”, I agree that the authors of this preprint misinterpret the findings of that manuscript and apparently do not understand the data upon which Pfau et al. drew their conclusions. The authors of this preprint need to re-read Pfau et al., of which J. Goetze was a coauthor and on this pre-print. One would think that with cross-authorship, at least Goetze would have caught this misinterpretation. It may be that this preprint was rushed without proper consideration of the data analysis and relevant literature. The preprint authors need to re-group, check their data analyses and carefully compare it (if it proves to not be a mistake in the data) to the relevant literature. They may want to assess their other references to assure that they are not misinterpreted like the example discussed by “anon anon”. Also, the preprint authors predict that the “sampling hole” would be genetically intermediate between the two ends as stated by “anon anon”. I agree with “anon anon” that this is the opposite of what is expected from population genetics. And like “anon anon”, I was lost in their metapopulation discussion, even though I have discussed metapopulations in my Conservation Biology class for years.

The authors may want to consider using a different formula for fitting their learning curves. Asadayoobi et al.

Consider the following fp = fatigue parameter l = learning rate T1 = Initial Performance n = trial number That(n) = predicted correct inputs at trial n To calculate fatigue, fg = exp(fp*(n^fp-1)) To predict correct inputs at n, That(n) = l*log(n)-fg+T1 Example code below that fits session 1 performance of your data, fig 1 fp=.3 l=6 T1=15 n=c(1:36) fg=exp(fp*(n^fp-1)) That1=l*log(n)-fg+T1 plot(That1) Example code that fits session 2 performance of your data, fig 1 fp=.5 l=5 T1=25 n=c(1:36) fg=exp(fp*(n^fp-1)) That2=l*log(n)-fg+T1 plot(That2) This model is similar to Park and Schweighofer (2017) https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih...

However, as we discussed with the authors prior to the publication of the paper, we found the high percentage (>50%) of parasites that did not have 22 cortical/subpellicular microtubules in the reported dataset surprising and was not consistent with what our lab has observed in the course of over a decade of working on Toxoplasma cytoskeleton.  To make sure we were not just going by a preconceived bias, we imaged non-extracted parasites in which the cortical microtubules were fluorescently labeled by TrxL1 endogenously tagged with mEmeraldFP [2].  We collected ~150 three-dimension (3D) structured illumination microscopy (SIM) image stacks, choosing fields that appeared to include at least one parasite viewed end-on.   In total, those 3D stacks contain images of ~ 1500 parasites.  From those 1500, we selected 106 parasites that were oriented such that it was possible to count unambiguously all of the cortical microtubules in a single slice of the 3D-SIM stack.  Of these 106 parasites, 104 have exactly 22 microtubules and 2 have 24 microtubules.  Our conclusion is that the overwhelming majority of parasites have 22 microtubules, and that the frequency of deviation from this predominant configuration is of the order of 2%.  The significance of this low level of variation will be fully appreciated only when it becomes possible to propose detailed cellular mechanism for the patterning of the cortical array of microtubules.

I respect your viewpoint and agree it is an important point to distinguish between active and passive L1 transcription, and indeed this is something we have considered too. In the preprint version of the manuscript, I would highlight the control data shown in Extended Data Fig. 3e. Here we employ the L1 RNA FISH assay in mouse N2A cells, with and without L1SM delivered by plasmid. We observed very little L1 signal without L1SM, but when L1SM was added the L1 RNA FISH signal is very strong. These data would suggest the L1 signal picked up by RNA FISH is not predominantly the result of passive transcription. As well, beyond the multiple RNA FISH and qPCR assays we use to measure L1 expression (Fig. 3 plus supplementals), we also show L1 TF promoters are demethylated (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5) and more accessible (Fig. 1c) in PV neurons than other neurons, and that in our transgenic L1-EGFP animals (Fig. 2) the vast majority of EGFP+ neurons are PV+ too. It seems very unlikely that the L1 activity we have discovered in the PV neurons is an artifact of RNA FISH. Another way to show the L1 signal is resulting from active transcription in the future could be to do a 5'RACE style assay (inspired by your work and that from Devine on human L1) and see if the reads align back to the demethylated L1s. Do you have any suggestions on this? Thanks for your input on our work!

(in PK-15 cell line with monomeric or tandem circular genomic DNA of TTSuV2). These papers were published ten years ago, it appears to me there is not so much scientific progress in the Anellovirus field. Unfortunately, the authors did not show that the Molt-4 cell line is able to generate several viral passages and that these viral passages are relatively stable and there is a lower rate of recombination or mutation in the tandem circular genomic DNA of TTMV-LY2 or nrVL4619 after four viral passages at least. Indeed, I do not see any retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell assays or other cell line assays with the infection/transduction of the viral particles from Molt-4 or transfection of the circular viral DNA of nrVL4619 with the nLuc reporter (cloned into downstream region of ORF3) before animal study or in the animal study. I think there is no robust expression of infectious viral particles in Molt-4 cell line. Specially, when I look at the pics. 7-C, it looks like to me there are two types of viral complexes: two 12 x pentamer = 60-mer viral particles and about eight hundred 2 x pentamer = 10-mer small particles. It appears to me that the 10-mer particles (2 x pentamer) run together with 60-mer particles (12 x pentamer) and these 10-mer particles (2 x pentamer) form a kind of 10-mer x 6 = 60 non-capsid agglomerates which harbor/bind viral DNA and protect the viral DNA against DNAse qPCR assay. (vis. Subir Sarke et al.: Structural insights into the assembly and regulation of distinct viral capsid complexes). In addition, I do not see any separation of 5 MDa (12x5) from 1MDa (2x5) particles after iodixanol linear gradient and SEC purification in Fig 7-B. I would guess that the physical DNA titer comes mostly from 2 x pentamer = 10-mer non-capsid small DNA particles. It seems to me there is still not enough circular viral DNA to assembly 12x5 real viral capsid particles in Molt-4 cell line or viral capsid particles (12x5) are unstable and need an assembly-activating protein or ORF1 capsid protein still evolves to form a stable capsid……..

The authors ask whether and how multichaperone complexes including Hsp70, Hop, Hsp90, and p23 bind to Tau, and whether phosphorylation of Tau (as is observed in tauopathies) affects these interactions. Using native PAGE, NMR, aggregation assays, crosslinking-MS, and SEC, the authors show the formation of a various high-MW Hsp70/Hop/Hsp90/p23 multichaperone complexes that differentially bind to and inhibit the aggregation of Tau and PTau. This paper successfully shows that multichaperone complexes are competent binders of both Tau and phosphorylated Tau, and furthermore show that these complexes are capable of modulating aggregation in vitro, neither of which had previously been explicitly observed. Based on these data, the authors argue that interactions between the chaperones and Tau are important for protein homeostasis. The manuscript would be strengthened by a clearer delineation between which claims are based purely on the data presented in this manuscript and which claims are extrapolated from a combination of these data and literature precedent. Overall, this paper identifies a potentially important interaction and suggests that Hsp70/Hsp90 multichaperone complexes may be important in tauopathies, thus laying the groundwork for future studies elucidating the role that such complexes play in vivo. Major points: 1. The results here do indicate differential interaction between the multichaperone complex and Tau and PTau. However, it would be useful to discuss more clearly what makes the PTau used here ‘pathologically modified,’ beyond having overlapping phosphorylation sites. Are there specific sites in patient-derived PTau that are heavily phospho-enriched, or patterns of co-phosphorylation between multiple sites? Consider more thoroughly comparing the phosphorylation patterns of PTauCdk2 with those of patient-derived Tau. Alternatively, consider changing the descriptor ‘pathologically modified’ with something more neutral, such as ‘phosphorylated.’ 2. A number of the analyses and conclusions (e.g. Figure 1c-d, Figure 2b, Figure 5c-d, Figure 6b-c) are based on quantitative analysis of native PAGE gels in which bands appear to be smeared or not well defined. Would it be possible to validate some of these KD values using NMR titration? It could also be helpful to the reader to note why more traditional methods for determining affinity (SPR, IRC, FP) were not used here. 3. In both the abstract and conclusion, the authors claim that the data in this paper establish the importance of the Hsp70/Hsp90 complex in chaperoning Tau for both protein homeostasis and neurodegeneration (e.g. the final sentence of the abstract and the first sentence of the conclusion). It would be helpful to make it clear what conclusions are explicitly shown by the data and what is extrapolation or speculation based on prior literature in the field. 4. In Figure 6f-h, the behavior of multiple samples, especially PTauCdk2:70Hop90 is quite odd. First, the variation between replicates seems quite large, given the magnitude of the error bars. Consider plotting all replicates individually to better visualize the spread of the data. Second, the ThT fluorescence decreases almost to baseline for PTauCdk2:70Hop90. Does this correspond to disaggregation? This could be directly tested by determining the concentration of PTau at different time points (e.g. by taking time-point samples, centrifugation to pellet aggregated species, and running the supernatant to visualize the amount of soluble protein). If soluble PTau increases with the decrease in ThT fluorescence, this would suggest disaggregation of aggregated PTau. 5. Finally, since the 70Hop90p23 complex seems to most potently affect PTau aggregation it could be useful to characterize the interaction between this multichaperone complex and PTau (e.g. binding and NMR experiments, as for 70Hop90:PTau in Fig6b-e). Minor points: 1. For Figure 1b, please comment on why the Tau alone lane displays no bands. Additionally, please explain why the band in the Hop alone lane is so high, despite the protein having a MW around 65 kD (indeed, this band is higher than that of the putative Hsp70/Hop/Hsp90 complex). 2. Figure 1f could be better annotated to differentiate fast and slow exchange regimes 3. For Figure 2b, it would be helpful to show an image of the gel, especially as you are describing the appearance of a new, high-MW band. 4. For Figure 2d, it would be helpful to show the CSP for Tau:70/Hop/90, in addition to that of Tau:70/Hop/90/p23 and Tau:p23 in order to show how the addition of p23 changes the interaction of the multichaperone complex with Tau. 5. For Figure 2e-g, it would be useful to add aggregation data for all possible combinations of chaperones (e.g. Tau + Hsp70/Hsp90, Tau + Hsp70/Hop, etc.) to clearly demonstrate that the full 70/Hop/90 system is needed to achieve inhibition. 6. In Figure 2e-g, the data is cut off before a fluorescence plateau is reached for Tau:70Hop90p23; consider rerunning this experiment until the plateau is reached. Additionally, it would be worthwhile noting in the text that aggregation is observed with Tau:70Hop90p23, in contrast to with Tau:70Hop90. 7. For Figure 3b, label y-axis with units. 8. For Figure 3c, please provide PDB codes for structures used in the proposed models. 9. In Figure 4d, some lines are purple and some are gray. Please specify what this color coding means. 10. In Figure 5b, why does the lane with Hop protein alone have a double band? This banding pattern is not present in other gels with the same sample. 11. For Figure 5c-d, please include analysis showing whether differences between 70/Hop/90:Tau and 70/Hop/90/p23:Tau are statistically significant. 12. For post-translational modifications of Tau, you mention performing phosphorylation of Tau using MARK2, as well as acetylation. However, you only show and discuss data using TauCdk2. Consider removing mention of the other post-translational modifications you made, or adding a short rationalization of why TauCdk2 was chosen for subsequent experiments. (Alternatively, you could include supporting data for experiments with acetylated Tau, if you have the data.) 13. For Figure 6b, it would be useful to show an image of the gel, as you are describing the appearance of new bands corresponding to PTau. 14. In Figure 6b, Hsp90 appears to bind both Tau and PTau quite poorly, even with a high excess of Tau. However, in Figure 6c, you show robust binding of Tau by Hsp90, with a low µM Kd. Please explain this discrepancy. Stylistic points/Miscellaneous: 1. PAGE should be capitalized throughout the paper 2. In Figure 2d, the gray bar showing the region of p23/tau interaction makes it difficult to see the I/I0 data in the lower panel. Consider adjusting the colors to make the data easier to read. 3. In Figures 1 and 2, intensity ratios are plotted as I/I0; in Figures 3 and 4, they are plotted as 1 – (I/I0). For ease of comprehension, consider changing these to be consistent throughout the paper. 4. As of May 3 your supplementary figures are not viewable on BioRxiv. It’s possible that some of our concerns have been addressed in your supplemental figures. We suggest you make these data available as part of the preprint!

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.18.476840v3#comment-5845594144,biorxivstage,1,"Summary of paper: T cells migrate from the blood into the lymphatics in response to extracellular stimuli. During these chemotactic responses, immune cells face sterically challenging environments and rely on their cytoskeletal systems to generate rapid movement and change shape without compromising the integrity of the cell. The major goal of this manuscript is to understand how T cells balance two major types of locomotion: amoeboid (i.e. actomyosin dependent blebbing) and mesenchymal-like (dynein driven, adhesive 2D movement). Currently, the ‘division of labor’ of how different cytoskeletal components balance competing interests such as force generation and structural integrity remains largely unclear. The authors highlight key proteins called septins as the ‘mechanobiological switch’ that allows T cells to seamlessly switch between amoeboid and mesenchymal methods of locomotion. The major success of this paper is that the authors identify septins as a modulator of T cell motility and create a reliable method to perturb septin activity in silico and in vitro with negligible toxicity to T cells. In a revised manuscript, the authors can consider adding data to validate the specificity of UR-219 to septins. To improve data interpretation, this paper would benefit from clarification and simplification of the language describing the distinct types of movement, especially in the introduction. Moreover, we see some translational potential for this discovery (described below in ‘minor points’) that could be included as speculation in the discussion. Overall, this paper contributes to the field’s understanding of how immune cells organize their superpositioned major cytoskeletal systems to move through tissue. The authors successfully employed a recently designed small molecular protein inhibitor to prove septins’ role in regulating propulsion, morphology, and structural integrity in migrating T cells. Major points: 1. To a novice mechanobiologist, the terminology used to define amoeboid vs mesenchymal migration in the introduction is complex and could be more clear with additional physiological examples (such as how diapedesis was well described). In particular, the authors may wish to distinguish amoeboid-like movement from phagocytosis and other blebbing morphologies, and provide examples of other cell types aside from T cells that exhibit each type of movement. Furthermore, the interpretation of the data may be improved by simplifying the language utilized to describe locomotion in general, such as ‘peristaltic treadmilling’ and ‘avoidance response to mechanically crowding hindrances’ in the abstract. While the glossary is indeed helpful for clarity of complex language, some of the words in the definition themselves are hard to understand (e.g. circumferential cortex contractility). The reviewers suggest adding amoeboid and mesenchymal-like locomotion as defined words in the glossary if space permits. 2. How do we know that UR-214-9 is only inhibiting septins? Consider chemical tools to validate the septin specificity or cite sources showing it doesn’t affect other components of the cytoskeleton (consider this reference which shows via microscopy that UR-214-9 doesn’t impact dynein ( https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.... Could also utilize CRISPRi or RNAi knockdown of septins to show recapitulation of the phenotype observed with UR 214-9. Lastly, consider checking for concordance of UR-219 dose responses in vitro versus in vivo. Minor points: 1. The authors may wish to speculate on how the actomyosin ring may impact and/or protect the nucleus, which appears to significantly compressed during translocation – see Lomakin et al., The nucleus acts as a ruler tailoring cell responses to spatial constraints ( https://www.science.org/doi... 2. The authors mention and/or list in figures many different signaling pathways impacted following septin inhibition but none were fully explained in the text (e.g. MAP-like motifs/MAP4). Consider describing one or two in more detail or omitting some from the manuscript for improved readability. 3. The authors may wish to speculate more on the translational applicability of this paper in regard to what their discovery of septin involvement in T cell locomotion means for potential future directions for T cell manipulation. For example, how can your wealth of quantitative imaging data inform in vivo modeling of T cell movement? Consider how factors in the immune microenvironment, such as other nearby immune cells and cytokines may influence locomotion in human tissue (could tie this in with the IL-2 gradient in Figure 6 that was shown but not discussed). While the clinical significance in regard to treatment of neurodegenerative disease was mentioned right before Figure 7, we suggest the authors also comment on the translational applicability in regard to understanding homeostatic T cell locomotion in a physiologic environment to begin as well. 4. While the mesenchymal migration work clearly defines cells as migrating through narrow pores (e.g. highly confining microchannels (3 uM-wide)), the collagen network/steric environment described lacks a sense of scale. What’s the clearance like in a 3D collagen network? 5. Figure 5c bottom legend - We definitely agree this beautiful image shows increased length with the +UR214-9, but the density of tubulin in the treated compared to control does not appear to be very different from the DMSO control T cell on the left hand side. This is in stark contrast to the very clear increase in density with septin inactivation in supplemental figure 3c. Consider moving this part of the figure from the supplement into the main manuscript to support your point. 6. Figure 5d - in the key at the very bottom, is the gray box on the very left meant to represent actomyosin cortex in the mesenchymal-like phenotype? The actomyosin cortex was almost exclusively talked about in the paper in regard to amoeboid dynamics, so I found it confusing as a reader to figure out which part of the image it was referring to. If it is indeed referring to the right hand mesenchymal section, I would suggest moving the gray box as well as the short and long microtubules toward the middle of the legend, and move the two pink and gray striped actomyosin septin icons to the left hand side of the legend. 7. Figure 6d - statistical significance?, also explanation for why there are 3 extra bars (in green) for CD4s that aren’t present for CD8s? 8. Figure 5A should show a ladder/marker and describe the expected size for the proteins, and illustrate the band quantification. A Supplementary Figure could be used to share this information. 9. Glossary: include definitions for “steric hindrances” and “circumferential cortex contractility”. Stylistic points: 1. Consider leading with full names of proteins and/or drugs before using acronyms to assist novice readers in the mechanobiology field (example 1- introduce MAP4 in the introducing as microtubule stabilizing and explain its significance, example 2- write out the full length of MAP4, SEPT9, and HDAC6 in the abstract) 2. Semantic point - in the text, the authors often include excess “the”, which makes sentences harder to parse. E.g. “Thus, we posit that *the* external steric cues, substantial enough to exert *the* indenting mechanical forces upon the expanding T cell surface, serve as *the* local triggers for *the* condensation of *the* hindrance-evasive septin-scaffolded cortex constrictions in the form of *the* cortical rings.” Excess instances of “the” are marked with asterisks 3. Figure 1 - could explain what phalloidin F channel is; also, in Figure 1d, it says URT-219 next to the left hand arrow instead of UR-219 (typo) 4. Figure 2e should include a scale, like all other figures in the manuscript. 5. Figure 3a - alignment is spelled incorrectly 6. In the text preceding Figure 6, what does low cortical contractility mean 7. If possible to add, this paper would greatly benefit from a graphical abstract of amoeboid vs mesenchymal movement with the role of septins illustrated. The authors can consider a simplified version of figure 7. 8. The list of Part Numbers for materials and reagents is comprehensive, so there is no need to repeat the Part Numbers in the text unless more than one P/N were utilized in different experiments.

I think it is interesting, and I believe that it is good to see multiple possible assemblies assessed for the same sample. I have some questions / comments: 1a) I could successfully find the SRA reads for PRJNA602938. However, I couldn't find the reads for PRJNA770127 or PRJNA781109. I get similar results if I start the search from Bioproject, instead of the SRA. Am I misunderstanding something, and/or do some of the projects need to be released to the public? 1b) I apologize if I am overlooking something, but I noticed that the ""Data Availability"" statement also says that "" final assembly files"" were deposited. I was curious where I could find the varying assembly results for the same sample.  If you make a decision about how to combine the results in a representative sequence, then I guess that would be more along the lines of what might be deposited in something like NCBI Nucleotide / GenBank.  While PRJNA602938 is recognized when I search NCBI Nucleotide, I am not finding any assembly sequence results. For the project where I can see the SRA reads, I also don't think I am seeing additional sequence under the genome for snow leopard. If you expected some refinement in the draft assemblies (and/or you wanted to avoid confusion with the separate assemblies used for evidence), then I guess maybe those could be deposited in some place like Zenodo.  However, my understanding is that the assembly sequence was deposited in some other way with NCBI. In general, I see that there is some ""analysis"" data that can be viewed from SRA Trace, but I found it hard to find an assembly sequence if I didn't already know the ""analysis accession."" Is there something that I am overlooking in terms of being able to find the assembly data deposited with NCBI? 2) As a minor comment/question, if I am understanding that there was African leopard sequencing UGA Genomics and Bioinformatics Core, then should the acknowledgements say "" We would also like to thank the University of Georgia Genomics and Bioinformatics Core for their assistance in HiFi sequencing.""?

Thank you for posting this very interesting manuscript. Best, The Sanchez Lab: In this preprint by Schaible et al, the authors explore different analytical workflows to create a more comprehensive view of microbial communities. The authors propose multimodal imaging modalities and apply it to two different biological systems. In one system they artificially mix two microbial cultures and apply a ‘FISH first’ approach of FISH-Raman-SEM. In the second system using multicellular magnetotactic bacteria from Little Sippewissett salt  marsh (LSSM)  they employ a SEM first approach of SEM-Raman-FISH, then EDS and NanoSIMS. Overall, we felt that developing different imaging modalities for use on the same sample would be incredibly beneficial and that the image outputs presented by the authors were robust, but felt that the overall organization of the manuscript was very confusing at times detracting from the overall readability and potential utility. We did appreciate that the authors discussed the merits and limitations of the methodology and the other way it could be used in and how that would impact the resulting data from the samples. Below please find a list of major and minor critiques that may be helpful to the authors. Major 1. The manuscript was organized by technique rather than biological application, the authors may find it useful to consider reordering the manuscript to frame the development of the techniques and workflows from the standpoint of the biological application and how they actually used it. For instance if reorganized by application, the extra methods mentioned at the end may be more appropriate as follow up experiments to address the biological question at hand rather than what read like extra experiments added as an afterthought. 2. The manuscript was very acronym heavy, it may be helpful to include a list at the beginning to increase readability. 3. In these experiments, it was unclear how the authors might control for false results? Could the authors expand on what they might recommend for positive and negative controls? 4. Regarding the MMB experiments, how does boiling the water affect the resulting growth of the microbes in the sample? It would seem rather than boiling it might have been advantageous to either rotovap, lyophilize, centrivap, or dialyze the sample?  How did the authors determine that 1 hour was appropriate?  How was the swamp water treated? Could the cells have been stressed? Do the cells double in a reasonable amount of time? Are they just slow growers? 5. Finally, the introduction really focused on mixed environmental microbial populations, but this manuscript didn’t really address this as a focus, rather its helping to create methodology which could eventually be applied to this problem. There seemed to be a slight mismatch in what was achieved experimentally and what the introduction was framed to represent. Minor 1. DOPE FISH - wrong acronym? 2. Are there any issue with sample storage if one research lab doesn’t have all this equipment? Is there urgency in the sample analysis? This was unclear as written. Were samples shipped from different locations? 3. Figures 2, 3 seem repetitive? 4. Figure S4 could have additional information included, it doesn’t seem like the results are comparable and the are colors hard to read. Can’t really quantitate this data, it seems like this was more of a detected or not detected experiment? There doesn’t appear to be a need for a correlation line. Are the measurements between CD/CH and D/H really comparable? The scale on X and Y axis should match so it's easier to compare. FIgure 4E add - sign to figure since its in legend? 5. It is not clear why nanoSIMS is optional if there is the discrepancy in nanoSIMS vs Raman measurements. Could the authors provide a more robust suggestion for when you would want to do one or the other? It almost seems like Raman, rather than nanoSIMS should be optional? 6. Figure 3, label boxes in Figure 3B are 3D. 7. Regarding the use of uncultured, the bacteria are technically cultured in the environment, they are yet to be lab cultivable. 8. Regarding the samples and the data as it was presented, how many replicates were performed? Was one sample subjected to multiple regions of interest for measurements (ie. same sample, different locations)? 9. The section titles could be more descriptive. 10. Many of the images were lacking scale bars.",2022-04-28T00:04:59,disqus_nXqTRGyBsq,Laura Sanchez,10.1101/2022.03.29.486285,"Correlative SIP-FISH-SEM-Raman-NanoSIMS links identity, morphology, biochemistry, and physiology of environmental microbes","George A.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.10.487811v1#comment-5839682819,biorxivstage,0,"Quite an interesting paper. My initial read was, ""mutation always increases affinity, regardless of target,"" but this is NOT what is being claimed. Instead, what I understand is being claimed is, given a protein (here, an antibody), the set of most plausible/likely evolutionary steps includes variants with increased affinity, which is relevant because the number of such steps is very small relative to the number of variants generally explored in practice when trying to improve antibody binding, meaning using the authors' technique will save time and resources. A caveat, which the authors address by using pre-COVID-19 data in training but applying their model to a SARS-CoV-2 antibody, is that large models can memorize training data, so if test data is sufficiently similar to training data, one can fool oneself into thinking a model is extrapolating when it might not even be interpolating very well. Perhaps one way to further test/reassure would be to explicitly choose proteins that are outside the (convex) space of training proteins. One could conceivably synthesize a randomer, screen it against a target library, choose the best binder (even if fairly poor), apply the model to select candidates, and then test whether these include better binders. Another way is the ""larger-N"" way: just test many more antibodies (including, for example, ones from rarely studied species), the logic being that if the model almost always works on a large enough set, it will likely work on your antibody, too. In thinking about ""efficient manifold hypothesis""---a term that brought to mind the ""narrow roads"" in the title of William Hamilton's collected papers---it is interesting to ask how one would disprove it: I suppose by finding no enrichment of biologically interesting behavior (e.g. binding) relative to e.g. random substitution. Quantitative extensions would be interesting topics of future work.

Instead, we sent him a new company delivery that we just had received at this time and had not yet tested. This badge was used in the publication of Ghosh, Khalil and Benedetti and shown to be highly unspecific and useless for studying RAD54 phosphorylation. After we had sent the antibody to Dr. Benedetti, we had also tried it ourselves and confirmed its poor quality that prevents any useful studies. Since the company could not produce a new specific badge of the phospho-specific RAD54 antibody, we took a different approach to extend our studies on the physiological significance of the RAD54-Ser572 phosphorylation. Specifically, we generated RAD54-Ser572 to Ala572 mice by knock-in techology and studied DNA double-strand break repair in fibroblasts obtained from such mice. We observed a repair defect in the RAD54-S/A mutant fibroblasts which is of the same extent and epistatic to the repair defect observed after siRNA-mediated knock-down of NEK1. This result confirms and extends our conclusion of the Spies et al paper.

And we are delighted to share additional information about SpotLink with you. 1.	The mass range of the alpha peptide in the DPDP algorithm is 0 to half the mass of the precursor. Each alpha peptide has a mass range that corresponds to the precursor ion, which corresponds to the beta peptide's mass range. The beta peptide's mass walk interval is identical to that of the alpha peptide. To be more precise, if the mass of a cross-linked precursor ion is M, the alpha peptide moves within the mass range [0, M/2]. For an alpha peptide with mass m, the beta peptide walk within [M-m,M]. 2.	The article's Method section includes a detailed description of the score and site score. If additional details are required for, we are willing to include them in subsequent version. 3.	Multiple cross-linking sites are frequently used in the identification process. Our sFDR calculation process ranks these cross-linking site alternatives globally across all cross-linked peptides, providing a probabilistic-based reliability evaluation. Additionally, SpotLink reported results are determined using the aforementioned probability. 4.	Performance evaluation is done on self-made synthetic data is adopted by many researches. Besides our self-made synthetic data can be published available on the GitHub . At the same time, we are willing to test on more datasets. 5.	A substantial number of cross-links in the condensin dataset is overlength. Such results exist in both Xi and SpotLink.

Or could you look for AvrSr50 homologs (also on the fold level with AlphaFold) and test them if they are AvrSr33? •	Could you do targeted/random mutagenesis of the important sites in the Sr50 LRR (based on 2D) to make Sr50 recognize AvrSr50_QCMJC? •	You are talking about this NB-ARC domain – LRR interaction (latch) and how this could be involved in signalling in as far as the disruption of this interaction might trigger activation.

During the process of reading, I thought in a couple of comments that might be interesting to discuss: 1-In the human samples included, it is not specified the approximate cervical level for each one of them. Since I see that many of them show patent central canals, I was wondering if they might belong to the upper C1, or, maybe, to low medulla, in which canal patency is normal (Garcia-Ovejero et al., BRAIN, 2015, supp fig S3). It is very common to receive samples from tissue banks labelled as cervical cord that anatomically really belong to  low medulla. Maybe a low mag images from your samples could help to identify this, or you could specify the cervical level   of each sample in the table. 2-Some years ago (Garcia-Ovejero et al., JCN, 2013), we found a rare subpopulation of cells in the ependymal region of the rat spinal cord that was unfrequent and mostly located the lateral aspects of the ependymal lining.These cells proliferated during postnatal development and in response to injury, and formed clusters in mature ages. They could be identified by a strong expression of cannabinoid receptor 1 (cnr1, CB1). We also found them in mice. I was wondering if they could be related with the lateral populations of stem cells that you describe here or overlap somehow. Did you find expression of cnr1 in these cells?.

The authors argue that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor results in a reduction in CFTR protein levels, which in turn leads to increased inflammation in the COVID-19 airway. This is impactful because the authors identify a mechanism of inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection that was not previously appreciated. Moreover, these findings link the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and cystic fibrosis. The paper is well written and easy to follow; the list of goals at the end of the Introduction, and the italicized conclusions at the end of each results section were particularly helpful and contributed to overall clarity. Overall, the data support the major conclusion that there is less cell-surface CFTR following Spike protein binding, leading to inflammation. Nonetheless, we felt that the title of the paper is overstated, and western blot experiments should be replicated, and quantified where appropriate. Major comments: The paper title is overstated. Specifically, the paper does not look directly in the “COVID-19 airway”, and the paper does not determine the extent to which CFTR-mediated inflammation contributes to inflammation during infection by SARS-CoV-2. We recommend rewording the title to something like “Inhibition of CFTR signaling by the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein leads to inflammation”. Experiments involving western blots should be repeated. Where the differences in protein levels are modest, e.g. TRADD levels in Figure 1, the authors should quantify the band intensity normalized to the control. The authors could either include replicate blots as supplementary data, or quantify all western blot data from replicates, showing variability. Additional comments: It would be helpful if the authors could briefly describe the differences between the original Spike protein and the Beta variant in relation to why the Beta variant binds ACE2 more strongly. Figure 5 could be moved to the supplement since it reanalyzes data shown in other figures. The conclusion from Figure 6 is understated: “Thus the possibility of ACE2 being a physical bridge, direct or indirect, between Spike protein and CFTR cannot be excluded.” The data in Figure 6 make a more compelling case for an ACE2-CFTR interaction than the text suggests. The description of data for ENaC in Figure 8 should be expanded. First, it is not clear from panel A that ENaC gamma cleavage is higher in the presence of Spike protein, rather than overall higher ENaC protein levels with the same degree of cleavage. Second, there is no explanation for the lower band seen in panel B (first lane after the ladder). What is the significance of the pairs of lanes in Figure 6B? Are these replicates? Different elutions? What is the “lysate” lane shown in Figure 6B? Please also explain in the figure legend what “NRS” is. Figure 3 – what concentrations of Spike protein are used in glycoside-treated samples? The legend appears to have an error. The conclusion from Figure 7 is overstated. It does appear that the levels of CFTR at the cell surface are reduced more than total CFTR levels as a result of adding Spike protein, but the mechanism for this cannot be inferred from these data. Suggested future experiments: Test the Beta-1.315 Spike protein variant alongside the original S1S2 Spike protein for experiments shown in Figures 1, 3, and 7.

This practice evokes a very specific set of neurological, physiological and psychological outcomes, which allows for the exceptional experience of freediving to depths as great as 214 meters.  The fact that the breathe-up often involves mouth breathing with a snorkel adds support to the idea that an intrinsic resonance mechanism involving breathing-induced intracranial pressure (ICP) pulses transduced by PIEZO channels may promote promote the specific brain state.  Once the dive commences, cardiac-induced ICP pulses transduced by PIEZO channels may further regulate in a top-down manner the reduction in freedivers' heartbeat rate (to as low as 12 beats/min).",2022-04-19T15:46:36,owen_hamill,Owen Hamill,10.1101/2020.03.24.006452,"Piezo2, a pressure sensitive channel is expressed in select neurons of the mouse brain: a putative mechanism for synchronizing neural networks by transducing intracranial pressure pulses","Jigong Wang, Owen P.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.16.484584v1#comment-5826631986,biorxivstage,1,"Naive T cell migration between and within lymphoid organs is essential for detecting cognate antigen on antigen presenting cells; this migration is largely driven by CCL21-CCR7 signaling. This manuscript explores the WNK1 pathway, which is induced by CCR7 signaling and results in ion influx necessary for T cell migration (as shown by this group’s previous work). The authors analyze each WNK1 pathway member’s contribution to migration speed and cell volume through selective ablation and inhibition of proteins within the pathway. They further uncover a spatial enrichment of these proteins at the leading edge of migrating T-cells; localized water entry at this leading edge results in localized swelling and increasing membrane-F-actin spacing. They propose that WNK1 signaling facilitates F-actin polymerization via a Brownian ratchet mechanism. The major success of this paper is in developing a concise model for the role of WNK1 pathway activation and subsequent ion influx in cell migration through localized water entry facilitating F-actin polymerization. Moreover, the authors decisively link chemokine signaling not only to directional decision-making but also to the physical act of cell migration. Only minor aspects of the model require clarification; specifically, it is unclear to what extent WNK1 signaling drives directional migration in addition to physical migration (see below). Simple experiments (or reanalysis of existing ones) might be sufficient either to clarify the model or to demonstrate that the uncertainties in question will require extensive further investigation. Overall, this paper deepens the field’s molecular understanding of chemokine signaling, specifically the extent to which intracellular structural reorganization is a necessary component of chemokine-induced migration. Major Points: -While the data show a WNK1-dependent migration speed effect, they also suggest that this may not be the only effect of WNK1 on cell migration. If WNK inhibitors reduce T-cell shape polarization and increase circularity (supplemental Fig. 1D), is it possible that WNK regulates directional movement in addition to migration speed? Alternatively, given that migration speed is determined from timelapse images multiple seconds apart, is it possible that the measured difference in speed is actually detecting an impaired ability to maintain directional movement? An analysis of displacement vs. distance over the imaging timecourse would provide insight as to whether WNK-inhibited T-cells also display directional dysfunction. Alternatively, providing CCL21 as gradient rather than as a homogenous stimulus could enable an analysis of whether WNK signaling is necessary for accurate directional movement. -The claim that “WNK1 pathway proteins and their activities accumulate at the leading edge of the cell” raises a few unresolved questions. Specifically, does a pre-designated leading edge accumulate WNK1/OSXR1/other WNK signaling effectors? Or do local accumulations of these proteins determine the leading edge of the cell? While a textual revision of this claim could reduce the imprecision, the question raised is interesting and worth answering. For example, when migrating cells switch direction (either spontaneously or in response to an experimentally altered chemokine gradient), do WNK1 and effector proteins begin to accumulate on the new leading edge prior to directional switch, or afterwards? If the former is the case, implying that WNK1 accumulation and signaling may drive selection of a leading edge, WNK1 may play a fundamental role not only in chemokine-driven physical migration but also in the response to chemokine gradients. If the latter is the case, implying that a leading edge recruits WNK1, this signaling pathway would instead drive migration in whatever direction has already been selected. Either way, additional analysis or context would clarify the role of WNK1 signaling in the overall response to chemokine signaling and the extent to which WNK1 drives “movement” vs. “directional migration.” Minor Points: -To the reader unfamiliar with in vitro migration assays, the rationale for the inclusion of ICAM - a signaling molecule that could interfere with analysis of chemokine signaling pathways - is unclear; consider providing a textual explanation for this decision. -As stated, OXSR1 and STK39 both phosphorylate SLC12A2; is their role redundant, are both necessary? (Specifically, if the experiments in Fig 1B are repeated with OXSR1-/-/STK39+/+ and OXSR1+/+/STK39T243A/T234A, would we expect to see the same decrease in migration speed as OXSR1-/-/STK39T243A/T234A, no loss in migration speed, or an intermediate phenotype?) -If AQP3 is the main water channel expressed on CD4 T cells, why does inhibition of this channel not change basal volume of T-cells (as with Wnk1/Osxr1 inhibition)? Does this data suggest a functional redundancy of water channels, as is suggested with ion channels? -Consider providing an explanation or reference for the selection of CDC42/CD44 as definitive markers of the leading and trailing edge. -In Figures 2A-C, it appears that WNK1 and downstream effectors are somewhat enriched at the trailing edge of cells relative to the middle (though to a lesser extent than at the leading edge); speculation as to the significance and cause of this enrichment would help clarify the data. Additionally, the cell expressing GFP alone appears to have a shorter distance from leading to trailing edge, which may also contribute to this effect. -In Figure 3, plasma membrane (PM) and actin signals generated via instant structured illumination microscopy are normalized, and distances between peaks are measured. These peaks are further away at the cell’s leading edge than on the sides, leading to the interpretation that there is more distance between actin and membrane at the leading edge. However, this interpretation ignores the possibility of a thicker and/or differently distributed actin layer at the leading edge, with the densest region (corresponding to the “peak” of the normalized signal) further away from the membrane simply because the layer of actin is thicker. This scenario would produce identical normalized data despite involving no difference in the distance between the edge of the actin layer and the edge of the membrane. While figure 4 suggests that there is less membrane-proximal actin at the leading edge, the actual distance between membrane and the actin that is present remains unclear. Consider providing un-normalized data to help clarify this interpretation (with similar peak intensities between leading and non-leading edges implying similar actin layer distributions). Alternatively, consider comparing the strength of the (non-normalized) actin signal at the location of the membrane signal across cell membrane locations. -In Figure 3B, the actin and membrane signals appear to be normalized to peak actin and peak membrane fluorescence, respectively. In contrast, in Figure 3C, both signals appear to be normalized to peak membrane fluorescence. Consider clarifying whether this is the case, and why these distinct strategies are utilized. -Could the negative effect of hypotonic solutions on the migration speed of phenotypically normal T-cells arise from water entry through non-AQP3 water channels? (Presumably any additional entry of water through AQP3, concentrated at the leading edge, would further increase migration speed). If this is the case, wouldn’t non-specific cell-wide water entry, and subsequent diminishing of directional migration, still occur in WNK-inhibited T-cells? The use of superresolution imaging and/or membrane-proximal actin visualization in experiments involving altered tonicity could provide insight as to where hypotonicity-induced water entry is occurring. Additionally, speculation as to why the benefit of bypassing a blocked WNK pathway overcomes the deficit caused by non-leading-edge-specific water entry (if visualized) would be helpful. -Could labeled materials (e.g. water and sodium isotopes) or depletion of individual ions (i.e. sodium, potassium, etc., one at a time) be used to further characterize the influx of ions and water proposed in this manuscript? While possibly outside of the scope of this paper, consider discussing this (or other biochemical methods) as part of a set of proposed future experiments. Stylistic notes: -The order of the data as presented in the figures does not match the order of data as presented in the text. For example, the first half of figure 1 is discussed, followed by the entirety of figure 2, followed by the second half of figure 1. Consider revising the text to reflect the order of the data in the figures, or vice versa. -Consider including figure 4k as a graphical abstract for the published paper (for people unfamiliar with the signaling pathway and who get confused by the acronyms). Further, on figure 4k, consider adding a visual depiction of G-actin monomer addition to the F-actin filament tips following the depiction of the membrane swelling. -Consider stating the full names of proteins discussed before using their respective acronyms (e.g. lysine deficient protein kinase 1 for WNK1), to help readers unfamiliar with these proteins. Note: We cannot offer expert feedback on the superresolution microscopy methods used, other than the already raised questions about the interpretation of the resulting data.
