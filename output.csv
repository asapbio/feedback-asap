Here are our highlights: Including nutrient availability shifts the focus of antibiotic control from ""more drug vs less drug"" to how the population's vulnerability state can be altered as a mechanism driving extinction. The reinforcement learning (RL) agent discovers strategies that humans would be unlikely to design, such as giving nutrients before antibiotics and pausing drug application until cells return to a susceptible state, illustrating how machine learning-guided therapy can find hidden leverage points. It's unlikely that clinicians will have access to ""full-state"" information like subpopulation composition or proteome sector fractions. By restricting the agent's observations to the population growth rate, the authors demonstrate that RL-based population control is feasible even with severely limited observability. Rigorously testing the generalizability of the RL method shows that it can discover principles of susceptibility that are broadly applicable. Uncovering such principles enables RL to propose treatment strategies that leverage fundamental cellular physiology, rather than simply fitting a training scenario.",2025-11-25T21:14:55,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

Here are our highlights: This work evaluates the potential for oral microbiome sequencing to predict esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The authors transparently evaluate the potential for their model to generalize to external, held-out datasets. We like how the formulation of the method is clearly articulated, beginning with simpler descriptive statistics and culminating in the final model. The authors compute and visualize SHAP values, revealing that some of the top predictive features are microbes already putatively associated with disease incidence. While the biological properties of these features are described in detail, the authors are also careful to emphasize that causality has not been robustly assessed (in this work, or more broadly). We like how the authors emphasize that the oral microbiome is relatively stable over time compared to other body sites. We are excited by the possibility that, in principle, this stability could support individual longitudinal surveillance efforts that could lead to the discovery of predictive signatures with greater generalizability (accounting for individual baseline variability).",2025-11-25T15:00:15,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

Here are our highlights: This study provides a clear and thoughtful evaluation of whether modern deep generative models can meaningfully improve ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR). The authors explore a compelling idea: that variational autoencoders (VAE), trained on homologous protein families, might capture epistatic interactions that classical site-independent evolutionary models omit. A key highlight is the demonstration that VAE latent spaces do recover meaningful phylogenetic structure. The authors show that relationships among sequences are encoded coherently in the latent representation, suggesting that deep models can learn informative global organization from sequence data - an encouraging insight for future machine-learning approaches to molecular evolution.Another important contribution is the comparison across simulated evolutionary scenarios, with and without epistasis. Across all cases, classical maximum-likelihood ASR methods outperform the VAE-based approach. Finally, the study identifies the decoder as a key bottleneck, offering a constructive direction forward for the field. Even when the latent space contains strong phylogenetic signal, reconstructing accurate ancestral sequences remains challenging. The authors highlight a concrete opportunity for model development and for integrating phylogenetic constraints more explicitly into deep generative architectures.",2025-11-25T11:41:10,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

It’s really exciting to see “the molecular face”. You made a very intriguing experiment with the partially NCP unwrapping and received a hopeful result on it. One more interesting feature is relative to PARP1 trapping mode in the presence of different inhibitors that is a direct demonstration of protein holds-on on DNA. However, after discussion your paper on a lab seminar I have got several questions that probably arise due to I am not a specialist in optical tweezer and confocal microscopy fields. I hope that you could clarify it for me. 1. I couldn’t find in the text how the dwell and gap times were converted to k(off) and k(on app). Is it just the reciprocal value of the projection of the inflection point of the sigmoid approximation onto the time axis? Additionally, is it correct the kon app = k(on)/C(PARP1)? How did you estimate the DNA concentration under single molecule conditions? I also could not find the PARP1 concentration used in the experiments. Is that 0.1 nM? 2. The time resolution of microscope used in the work is 1/10s. One of the basic assumptions for result interpretation was the absence of association/dissociation acts of the DNA-protein complexes during this time period. As far as spontaneous collisions are limited by diffusion and can happen 10^9 times/s, how do you estimate the probability of reassociation of dissociated complexes during the dwell periods? To exclude the reassociation did you try to transfer the trapped DNA with bounded PARP1 molecules to the channel without PARP1 (with buffer) with keeping the flow? In my opinion it could allow to avoid PARP1 reassociation events from the calculation. 3. In the text you do not discuss potential dimerization of PARP1 and PARP2 under DNA/nucleosome bounding. Although, it seems to me that it is important for Kd calculations. 4. According to your data, the binding manner of PARP1 with nick-sites is different in frames of one DNA molecule. Part of tracks demonstrate a long dwell and gap periods; another part is characterized short dwell and gap periods. Did you take it into account in any way at the constant calculations or results interpretation? Moreover, on the kymograph of PARP2 binding there are only two nick sites from seven were found in association, and due to long dwell periods, it led to low Kd calculated value. Could you somehow comment your interpretation of the obtained result and the feasibility of using calculation method? 5. I didn't find in the text and references what kind of plasmids did you use for the transient overexpression of the fluorescent-tagged proteins. I will be very grateful for clarification these questions for me. Thanks in advance, Mikhail",2025-11-24T08:18:05,disqus_viPf6DEIDr,Mikhail Kutuzov,,,,

Assessing endophenotypes solely in wild-type mice, rather than in models that exhibit a clear deficit relative to wild-type and can therefore show selective rescue, can be fundamentally misleading when inferring therapeutic potential. If psilocybin alters behaviour in wild-type animals, this may actually reflect a deleterious or maladaptive effect, given that many of these behaviours are evolutionarily conserved and serve important adaptive functions. For example, consider repetitive grooming. In wild-type mice, grooming is a healthy, essential behavior that maintains hygiene. It is only when this behaviour becomes excessive — as observed in SAPAP3 knockout mice, where compulsive grooming results in skin lesions and self-injury — that it becomes pathological. In such a model, restoring grooming to wild-type levels would represent a meaningful, therapeutically relevant effect. But if one were to test only wild-type mice, observe no change, and conclude that psilocybin lacks translational relevance for compulsive behaviour, such a conclusion would be unwarranted. Conversely, if grooming were reduced in wild-type mice, this could itself be maladaptive, as it disrupts a necessary and evolutionarily important behaviour. Statistical constraints, such as floor and ceiling effects, further complicate interpretation in wild-type cohorts depending on the behavioural assay employed. Altogether, this is a crucial point that warrants careful consideration when designing and interpreting preclinical behavioural studies aimed at evaluating true therapeutic potential. Finally, I would like to congratulate all of the scientists involved in this impressive multi-institutional effort. Collaborative research of this scale is essential for generating reliable, reproducible findings, and studies of this nature will undoubtedly help advance the field in meaningful and constructive ways.",2025-11-23T18:28:52,james_gattuso,James J Gattuso,,,,

I found the introduction and discussion sections to be particularly well structured and were very logical in their progression.

I think this project could really grow from investigating the correlation of call frequency/density with canopy cover as an explanatory variable in something like a GLMM or ANOVA. If you were able to do this, I think it would be really cool to create some additional layers like percent road coverage within a 1km buffer or percent surface water to test some of the suggested explanations for the shift in overall abundances. You could even quantify stuff like distance to forest patch or something like that to really hone in on patch effects.

While pooling can reduce sequencing costs and simplify workflow, it also eliminates all variation at the individual level. This variation is essential for understanding how thermal stres and pathogen infection can impact hosts differently. Individual bees vary in microbiome composiiton, immune status, body size, and infection intensity, and these variations are biologically meaningful. When you average individuals inot a singular pooled sample, it blurs whether observed microbial shifts reflect consistent responses across bees or the cominance of a single/few outlier(s). This loss of clarity can affect nearly every analysis presented in the manuscript, including alpha and beta diversity estimates, infection quantification, and the interpretation of taxa associated with particular treatments. Even though the manuscript briefly acknowledges this limitation, they frame it mainly as a reduction in sequencing resolution rather than a core biological constraint. The manuscript would benefit from a clearer justification for pooling, whether it was due to logistics, cost, survivorship, or colony level focus. Also a more explicit discussion of how pooling influences the interpretation of microbiome patterns would greatly clarify this inconsistency. Overall, addressing this issue directly in the manuscript would improve the transparency in the study’s results, and strengthen the conclusions.",2025-11-21T18:43:34,,AzC919,,,,

First, you assigned distance to forest patch as a fixed effect, but I think this effect would be more accurately described as random. Since there is a range of possibilities for distance to forest patch I believe this should be a random effect because there are not a fixed number of possibilities for this variable.

We have already resolved the question you pose: ""But we are unsure which came first: is it the proteins that bring these ordered lipids with them, or do the lipids form domains into which the proteins partition?"" Indeed, we built a theoretical framework where one of the central theories is that lipids do not form stable subregions that subsequently recruit proteins ( https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-024-01849-6). The answer lies with lipid fingerprints ( https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00143). Suppose lipid-lipid interactions were strong enough to form platforms large enough to accommodate proteins (the evidence for this is very poor, by the way). It wouldn't matter. The idea that the proteins and lipids are collectively present in the final structure suggests that the proteins have preferential interactions with the lipids, so there would have to be a very good reason why the lipids would ""ignore"" the proteins such that they cluster and then recruit the proteins in a sequential manner. If this is insufficient to cover all cases (for example, if the proteins are not initially present in the membrane when the lipids supposedly cluster), there are many other reasons why this cannot occur. For example, if the lipid platforms are ordered, one would expect there to be a free energy barrier for protein entry. I could go on and on, but there is really no need. It is a thermodynamically absurd notion. This sequential mechanism was popularized by the original lipid raft theory. Since it was false, lipid rafts underwent many ad hoc modifications and should now be regarded as pseudoscience ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/397646378_Lessons_from_pseudoscience_in_biology). I should also mention that the phase separation narrative (which I debunk here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17201253), and Kusumi et al.'s picket fence/tiered mesoscale domain model are also wrong. I think you will understand why after reading lipid fingerprints ( https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00143) and the proteolipid code ( https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-024-01849-6). Since I am challenging so many of their beloved theories, the lipid raft people, who still run the place, do not want you to know that the proteolipid code exists.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.10.658907v2#comment-6799391350,biorxivstage,0,"This study explores how Pheidole bergi colonies are distributed across habitats and spatial scales in the Monte desert, and how natural and anthropogenic environmental variation affects colony density and spatial structure. Long-term data reveal strong preference for protected algarrobal habitat; major density declines through drought years; density-dependent shifts from aggregation to more dispersed patterns; consistent microhabitat selection toward inter-patch borders and open patches. This is a promising and well-executed spatial ecology study, but several issues must be addressed for clarity and robustness. The largest concerns involve justification of biological assumptions, narrative organization, overinterpretation of environmental drivers, and insufficient integration of the anthropogenic component. MAJOR ISSUES 1.	The assumption that each nest corresponds to a separate colony must be justified This is the main flaw of this study. The analyses assume that each nest entrance represents an independent colony, but this assumption is never justified. Many Pheidole species are polydomous, meaning that multiple nests may belong to the same colony. If P. bergi is polydomous, nest counts may not correspond to colony counts, spatial clustering may reflect intra-colony nest structure rather than interactions among colonies, observed “repulsion” could represent spacing among satellite nests, and density declines may reflect contraction of colony structure rather than colony mortality. This has direct implications for all spatial analyses. Given that the authors note that little is known about the natural history of P. bergi, this issue needs to be addressed explicitly. The manuscript should clarify whether P. bergi is known to be monodomous or polydomous, how this was assessed in the field, and what implications this uncertainty may have for interpreting spatial patterns. 2. The manuscript does not explicitly link its predictions to its results and discussion The Introduction presents several detailed, scale-specific predictions regarding habitat-level differences in aggregation, drought-induced density-dependent thinning, mosaic-driven microhabitat selection, predicted shifts in inter-colony interactions, and responses to anthropogenic disturbance. However, these predictions are not revisited consistently in the Results or Discussion. In several sections it is unclear which prediction a given result addresses, or whether a result supports or contradicts the authors' expectations. Reorganizing the Results and Discussion using a clear prediction–finding–interpretation structure would substantially improve narrative clarity and help readers understand how each analysis addresses the study’s questions. 3. Anthropogenic variation is stated as a major objective but receives insufficient analysis The Introduction frames the study as examining abundance, habitat associations, and spatial arrangement across both natural and anthropogenic sources of environmental variation. Yet the anthropogenic component receives very limited treatment. The “grazed algarrobal” appears only in a single 2021 sampling, with no information provided about the intensity or history of grazing, and anthropogenic predictions are not explicitly stated. In the Discussion, the potential effects of grazing and dirt-road disturbance are mentioned only briefly, without deeper engagement or clear linkage back to the stated objectives. Clarifying the expected ecological effects of grazing and dirt roads, showing how those expectations were tested, and revisiting these comparisons explicitly in the discussion would bring the manuscript into better alignment with its claims. 4. A spatial overview map is essential but missing An important limitation is the absence of a spatial overview map. Because spatial scale and spatial context are central to the study, a map showing the locations of all dirt-road transects, he positions of dirt-road transects (D, F, D1, D2, F1, T, L, P1, P2, M), and the two permanent grids (J, V), habitat boundaries such as algarrobal, sand dunes, and grazed lands, and approximate distances among sites is essential for interpreting habitat comparisons and understanding how environmental heterogeneity relates to the observed patterns. Without such a map, it is difficult for readers to evaluate the spatial independence of sampling areas or the relevance of local heterogeneity. Including a map would greatly improve the clarity of the manuscript. 5. Environmental drivers underlying heterogeneous intensity patterns are inferred but not measured Along the dirt-road transects, for example, environmental attributes such as soil texture, moisture, or vegetation structure are invoked to explain variation in colony distribution, but these variables were not measured. Thus the interpretations rely on assumptions rather than data. The manuscript would benefit from acknowledging more explicitly that interpretations of road-scale heterogeneity are speculative unless environmental covariates are incorporated into the analyses. 6. Gibbs point-process model interpretation requires additional clarification These models are a strength of the manuscript, but their biological meaning is not always clear. The significance of positive versus negative interaction parameters may not be obvious to readers unfamiliar with point-process modeling. In addition, the first-order and second-order terms operate at similar spatial scales, leading to partial confounding that complicates interpretation. Although this confounding is acknowledged late in the Discussion, it would be more helpful to flag it earlier, so that readers can interpret the model results with appropriate caution. Providing more biological explanation of what the model components represent would enhance accessibility. 7. The long-term population decline is compelling but causality is overstated The manuscript describes a greater than fifty percent decline in colony density between 2001 and 2019, and an additional approximately forty percent decline between 2019 and 2025. These changes are attributed largely to drought. While this is plausible, causal claims are currently too strong given the absence of direct soil moisture data, prey availability measurements, reproductive output data, or queen survival data. Phrasing should be adjusted to reflect that the observed pattern is consistent with drought effects rather than demonstrating causality, and alternative explanations such as detectability changes, nest dormancy, or colony relocation should be acknowledged. MINOR ISSUES 1. The introduction overextends and lacks a clear conceptual framework The introduction reviews many ecological processes (competition, habitat heterogeneity, disturbance, droughts) but does not clearly articulate which mechanisms the authors expected to dominate at each scale (macro vs micro), or how these mechanisms generate distinct predictions. Explicitly state what processes are expected to drive spatial patterns at macro scale (abiotic heterogeneity vs density-dependent thinning) vs micro scale (territoriality, vegetation mosaic), and indicate which predictions are tied to drought, habitat type, or population density. 2. The macro-scale interpretation equates heterogeneous intensity with ecological responses, but the ecological drivers remain untested Along dirt roads, the intensity of colonies is strongly heterogeneous in algarrobal but not in grazed or dune habitats. However, the manuscript interprets these heterogeneities as linked to soil or vegetation structure, but these environmental variables were not quantified. The interpretation of “inverse density-dependent thinning” from 2019–2025 is plausible but speculative without a formal test. Acknowledge explicitly that without measured habitat covariates along the roads, the environmental interpretation is inferential. Clarify limitations of attributing density changes to specific drivers. 3.	Visual presentation of spatial results needs improvement Several figures (especially 2, 3, and 4) are extremely dense. Overlapping confidence envelopes make interpretation difficult. Lack of legends for symbols or shading in some subpanels. Figure 5 has too many components on a single page. Simplify or divide composite figures. Ensure that interpretation of Ripley’s L and pair-correlation graphs is clearly explained in captions. Highlight key distances at which patterns deviate from CSR. WRITING QUALITY The manuscript is written in generally clear and grammatically correct English, and the overall academic tone is appropriate. However, the prose is often excessively dense, with very long paragraphs and sentences that embed multiple ideas at once. The abstract is longer than necessary and would benefit from reduction. Parts of the Introduction are dense and could be streamlined. Important predictions, results, and conceptual transitions are sometimes buried within complex constructions, which makes the narrative harder to follow. Key terms and modeling approaches would benefit from brief explanatory context. In addition, the Discussion section is unusually long and occasionally repetitive, with several arguments stated multiple times across different paragraphs, while others are presented with more certainty than the data justify. This dilutes the impact of the key findings and makes it harder for readers to follow the logical flow of the authors’ interpretations. Overall, the manuscript would benefit from substantial stylistic polishing aimed at improving clarity, structure, and readability for organization and flow. Reference formatting should be checked for consistency. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the manuscript is based on a strong dataset with considerable potential. Addressing the issues outlined above, especially the need for clear hypothesis integration, fuller treatment of anthropogenic variation, inclusion of a spatial map, justification of assumptions about colony structure, and more cautious interpretation of environmental drivers, will substantially strengthen the scientific clarity and impact of the work.",2025-11-21T01:22:49,disqus_cfq1Qgrrr6,Aline Machado,,,,

However, I have a few comments/criticisms: I think there is an opportunity to discuss the metapopulation model here. Dispersal is highlighted heavily in this manuscript, but the metapopulation model isn't mentioned at all. Perhaps more a personal preference, but I would like you to define want a ""specialist"" is. This term is NOT adequately defined in the introduction. ""Specialist” refers to a lot of things. Are we studying diet specialists, habitat specialists, or something else? I assume we are studying habitat specialists, but that’s based in context clues. The use of PCA and PERMANOVA is appropriate, however, the  ""vegan"" package in R makes certain assumptions that you may NOT want. I would highly recommend using the PRIMER-E software to double check your analyses. The axes aren't grounded, also! They should start at zero. that being said, I enjoyed the color selection here.

Over the past years, this group has substantially shaped the field: from their highly cited foundational paper introducing the use of covariance matrices to derive cortical gradients, to a series of successful application studies in developmental neuroscience, and to the release of user-friendly software that has made this framework accessible to the broader community. The present perspective nicely complements this established body of work (with minimal - but existing redundancy) by contextualizing the framework within current methodological and conceptual developments. On the computational side, the authors appropriately acknowledge the importance of the equi-volume principle and the contributions of Waehnert et al. for cortical layerification. Given the centrality of this topic in their discussion, it could further strengthen the paper to briefly mention the known limitations of equi-voluming—such as its incomplete handling of cortical geometry, questions about column smoothness, and other challenges highlighted in recent work (e.g., Computing geometric layers and columns on continuously improving human (f)MRI data; additional practical notes as summarized on in ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128204801001881 or https://layerfmri.com/layerification/ (see sections on limits and beyond equi-volume) or here: https://layerfmri.com/equivol/). Touching upon these open issues would help clarify the current boundaries of the methodology without detracting from its utility. The paper’s emphasis on integrating cellular information with myeloarchitecture is compelling and forward-looking. One area that might further enrich the perspective is the recent progress in laminar angioarchitecture mapping. Incorporating vascular organization into the discussion could complement the covariance-based framework and provide a more holistic view of microstructural constraints on functional signals. Similarly, there is an opportunity to draw on emerging insights from laminar connectivity research. Several recent studies have shown how layer-dependent interactions can deepen our understanding of cortical organization and dynamics (e.g., Finn et al., 2021; Koiso et al., 2023; Huber et al., 2021). Highlighting the potential synergy between laminar connectivity and the authors’ gradient-based framework could further broaden the conceptual horizon of the perspective. Overall, this perspective is a well-written and valuable contribution that synthesizes an influential research direction and points to promising future avenues. With minor additions acknowledging methodological limits and incorporating insights from related subfields, the paper would offer an even more comprehensive and impactful guidepost for the community.",2025-11-20T17:00:09,renzohuber,Renzo Huber,,,,

Here are our highlights: This work demonstrates that metagenomes contains a vast layer of “not yet genome-resolved” biodiversity. According to the results, up to ~80% of putative species-level clusters are not represented by genomes of cultivated organisms or by MAGs. The study quantitatively shows that species discovery is far from saturation and strongly habitat-dependent. Human gut samples and anthropogenic environments are already densely sampled and contribute few new lineages per additional metagenome, whereas soils, aquatic ecosystems, the rhizosphere, and non-mammalian hosts remain true hotspots of unexplored diversity. A separate and fundamentally important result - confirmed numerically- is the observation that the structure of prokaryotic diversity follows the same universal statistical laws (the power-law Willis-Yule / Yule-Simon distributions) as that of eukaryotes. In other words, the authors demonstrate that the same simple macroevolutionary regularities operate across the entire Tree of Life.",2025-11-20T15:34:33,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

A true mutualistic interaction is one in which both partners benefit from the interaction. While there may be some cheating involved, the basis of the relationship must be mutually beneficial to both organisms involved. In the case of pitcher plants and insects, there can only be a single benefactor to any interaction. If the plant benefits from consuming an insect, the insect does not benefit. If the insect benefits from consuming pitcher extrafloral nectar, then that insect must not fall into the plant's trap and thus the plant does not benefit. There cannot be a true mutualism here. For the same reason, the sentiment of a ""reciprocal nutrient exchange between carnivorous plants and local insect populations"" (line 235) is misleading, as the insects which obtain nutrients from the carnivorous plants in question are, by necessity, not the same insects which provide nutrients to the carnivorous plants. The most appropriate framing device for this paper in my opinion would be to simply focus on whether any insects are able to obtain a significant portion of their nutritional requirements from carnivorous plants, which would make Darlingtonia not a strict predator; instead, it would occupy a less straightforward place in the trophic web of the serpentine fen. The manuscript does mention this concept several times, but never as the driving concept or overall thrust of the paper. I think reframing the paper, including the title, around questioning whether carnivorous plants are always strict predators of insects would improve the manuscript. To further the potential novelty of this paper, reframing could focus on the fact that it is already known that specialist insects benefit from interactions with pitcher plants (often in an actually mutually beneficial manner, sensu detritivorous pitcher plant inquilines) but far less is known about whether any generalist insects may benefit from interactions with the plants. Darlingtonia 's focal status in this study is more or less self-explanatory, but the use of Vespula specifically is far less so. At no point in the introduction are yellowjackets  set up to be a good candidate for the study at hand, nor do the methods explain why Vespula was chosen. It is my belief that the use of Vespula wasps is a strength of this study's design, and the manuscript should make that clear. There are several reasons why Vespula is an ideal choice here. For example, it is stated that wasps rarely fall prey to pitchers despite visiting them regularly, thus they are good candidate insects for an investigation of nitrogen isotopes which originate from pitcher nectar. Studies which investigate compounds that are found in higher concentrations at higher trophic levels (i.e., are biomagnified) might benefit from first looking at the highest trophic levels; if no signature is detected at the greatest point of biomagnification, then it is likely that lower trophic levels will likewise show no difference in bioaccumulated material. Vespula wasps occupy a high trophic level in this ecosystem, making them a good candidate for this study in this aspect as well. Yellowjackets are also easy to selectively capture in great numbers due to the availability of specialized traps, meaning there are cheap, effective, passive methods for sampling a large number of them. This paper does address that these wasps forage in localized patches, and thus can be more reliably assigned to either ""fen"" or ""forest"" patches, but this is brought up in passing. Any number of these points can and should be addressed, as it stands there is no explicit justification given for using these wasps as opposed to any other group of insects.",2025-11-20T03:10:28,osedaxMucofloris,osedaxMucofloris,,,,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.18.689145v1#comment-6798844946,biorxivstage,3,"This preprint already received a “major revision” decision. Unfortunately, the original reviewers were not available to evaluate it again, and the process stalled. Despite sending 15 additional peer-review invitations, no one agreed to take it on. Although the manuscript has now entered a new review process, I am attaching the previous reviewers’ comments. ------------------------- Reviewer 1 This isn’t a finding as not only is it already available information, the use of the available IUCN maps and statuses was part of the methodology. R/ We rephrased the sentence to clarify that it refers to the underlying data itself and not to our results. I like the approach they’ve taken, but none of this is novel information or unexpected. R/ Although it is well known that mountains promote diversity and endemism at a global macroevolutionary scale, this information has not been explicitly tested in Colombian squamates in conjunction with threat categories. We consider that clearly stating the result of hotspots of diversity and endemism in Colombian squamates can help local environmental policies. Therefore, while our results are consistent with theoretical expectations, this alignment does not diminish the novelty of our findings, as we provide the first quantitative analysis supporting these patterns in the local context. This is the main novel finding of the work and I’d recommend reorganising the text to stress this. R/ We modified several sections of the text to emphasize the finding highlighted by the reviewer, also in accordance with comments made by the other reviewer. Unclear what this means in the context of this paper. R/ We rephrased the section for clarity. This is just the existing EDGE list, so I’m not sure it warrants mentioning as an output here. R/ In accordance with a comment from Reviewer 2, we acknowledge that this is a local rather than a global list, and that species rankings may differ between the two. Therefore, we believe it is an output worth highlighting. Nevertheless, we have clarified in the text the differences between the local and global scores and their implications. This entire paragraph seems superfluous, and this work has nothing to do with the latitudinal gradient so it’s a strange thing to focus discussion on. R/ While we briefly mention the latitudinal gradient, the main purpose of this introductory paragraph is to provide general context on biodiversity, leading into the key argument of the subsequent sections: the need to understand biodiversity and extinction risk as multidimensional phenomena. We have made minor adjustments to better integrate the role of the latitudinal gradient in promoting tropical diversity, thereby reinforcing the importance of prioritizing conservation efforts in regions of exceptionally high biodiversity. Suggested added context as this was unclear as worded. R/ We accepted the reviewer’s suggestion and revised the text accordingly. I’m not sure this follows - more that, as the paragraph goes onto say, it results in a lack of understanding of the impacts and vulnerability of the species. R/ We rephrased the idea to make it clearer. This seems to be an inappropriate reference, as Paez et al. 2006 focused on turtles rather than squamates. Please check and reword as needed. R/ We double-checked the reference and confirmed that it is correct, as it covers not only turtles but all Colombian reptiles (including squamates, crocodiles, and turtles). This seems inconsistent with the earlier statement that “a local assessment is lacking” - should this rather say a recent local assessment? Though as the paper goes on to reference a 2015 ‘local assessment’, it’s unclear what this section means. R/ We agree with the reviewer and revised the text to clarify that we refer to a recent assessment that also considers different facets of biodiversity, not just species richness (i.e., taxonomic diversity). The figure given later is 597, and that was used as the basis for the analysis. This may be a discrepancy due to a later update, but the same Reptile Database update should be cited throughout the paper for consistency. R/ In the Introduction, we refer to the most recent estimate of 620 reptile species for Colombia, based on the latest update of the Reptile Database (2024). However, the analyses in this study were based on the 2023 version of the database, which listed 597 species at that time. Given that the analyses were conducted using the 2023 data, and a complete reanalysis would be required to incorporate the updated figures, we chose to retain the original dataset to ensure consistency and reproducibility. We have clarified this point in the text to avoid confusion. Better to use the term ‘squamates’ rather than ‘reptiles’ if crocs and turtles are to be excluded. R/ Done, we have consistently replaced ""reptiles"" with ""squamates"" throughout the text where appropriate. Once again, this could benefit from clarity. The data in the Reptile Database should be reviewed with reference to available material and literature to be used as a formal checklist, but it should be ‘complete’ - it’s more likely to erroneously list species from a country than to miss ones that actually occur there. R/ We agree with the reviewer and rephrased the sentence to make the idea clearer. Are the authors able to explain the discrepancy between this figure and the maps (which represented 81% of the dataset)? Most IUCN assessments will have maps, but no IUCN maps will be associated with species that don’t have assessments. R/ The figures were validated against the information provided in Table S1. As the reviewer correctly points out, there are more assessments than polygons, consistent with the supplementary material. The figure of 77% corresponds to 461 species (excluding DD and NE categories) out of 597 species in our dataset (461/597 = 0.77). Meanwhile, the figure of 81% refers to 481 species with available geographic information, including species categorized as DD (481/597 = 0.81). The discrepancy arises because DD species were included when considering geographic data but excluded from threat category analyses. We have revised the Methods and Results sections to clarify this distinction explicitly. Also, we updated the previous 77% figure to include DD species too, increasing it to 92%. This is not a sufficient way to evaluate whether the assessments are likely to need updating - the Criteria take account of the distribution and extent of threats to each species, not simply its distribution. The ‘needs update’ tag is applied by the Red List only to assessments more than 10 years old, which is all that should be mentioned here. R/ We understand the reviewer’s concern and acknowledge that a mismatch between EOO and threat classification is not sufficient by itself to determine if an update is needed. We have separated these ideas in the text: first, we highlight species whose assessments are formally tagged as “needs update” after 10 years; second, we discuss species whose EOO does not align with their current threat classification. We moved the second point to the 3.2 Geographic patterns section, and expanded the Discussion to better explain these observations. See above. The authors didn’t ‘show’ this, they interpreted the Criteria incorrectly. R/ See previous answer. We further expanded the Discussion section to better frame this point. I would consider it suitable for the manuscript to be more fully revised as a shorter paper, as the region-scale analysis within Colombia and the phylogenetic results are of more interest than the well-trodden path of identifying the Andes as an area of greater endemism than Amazonia and the additional analyses included in the paper render its main findings somewhat opaque in places. R/ We consider that highlighting the Andes as an area of high endemism is necessary to provide context for interpreting the patterns of phylogenetic diversity. While it may be a well-known topic, not all readers will have the same background. Although the manuscript is extensive because it covers taxonomic, geographic, and phylogenetic patterns, its current length (ca. 6,300 words, excluding references) is well within the 9,000-word limit for Original Research articles in Biodiversity and Conservation and only slightly above the typical 5,000-word range. Nevertheless, we made an effort to shorten unnecessary sections to improve focus and clarity. For example, we removed some analysis related to diversification rates and extinction risk, since as the Reviewer 2 pointed out, some metrics depending on branch lengths may be biased. Reviewer 2 L393-405: it is important to acknowledge the phylogenetic incompleteness of a national-level analysis, and how that might be affecting these results – divergence times are influenced by phylogenetic coverage and structure, removing >90% of squamate species from the phylogeny will give you divergence times between Colombian species, not true lineage age/divergence time information. This could be addressed with sensitivity analyses to explore how lineage age varies between pruned and complete trees, or with stronger discussion of the pitfalls of this approach in the methods and discussion, with clearer wording in the results. R/ We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment and fully agree. We performed additional calculations to assess sensitivity, and indeed, the age of some lineages can be severely affected, while others remain largely unchanged. Following the reviewer’s recommendation, we revised the Methods and Discussion sections to place greater emphasis on the limitations of using evolutionary metrics derived from pruned trees and on the considerations needed when interpreting these results. As the reviewer also notes, these results are not necessarily incorrect, since global conservation priorities do not always align with local ones. Additionally, we introduced local and global subscripts to our metrics to explicitly distinguish between them. 407-418: Distinction is needed between EDGE scores and national EDGE scores (literally just saying ‘national EDGE scores’ would suffice). It may also be useful to identify national-specific priorities – i.e. high ranking national EDGE species that are not highly ranked in global context. There are EDGE scores available for all vertebrates at the global level here ( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45119-z) . There are endemic Colombian squamates that are high EDGE in this study and also high EDGE at the global scale (e.g. Lepidoblepharis miyatai) but also species that are high EDGE nationally because of the phylogenetic diversity they are solely responsible for in Colombia, but the responsibility for which is shared beyond Colombia’s borders. These key cases can be instrumental in ensuring species that are globally ‘safe’ but locally important do not fall through the cracks. R/ Please refer to the previous response. We now explicitly distinguish between national EDGE scores and global EDGE scores throughout the text and highlight cases where species are locally important but not necessarily globally prioritized. L41 and throughout: “threatenedness” = “extinction risk” or “level of threat”. R/ Done. Throughout: It’s the IUCN Red List, not IUCN, particularly when referring to versions of the Red List database. R/ Done. L145: make it clear you’re referring to national endemics. R/ The Resolución 0126/2024 from Colombia’s Ministry of Environment (MADS) covers not only national endemics but all species occurring within the country’s administrative boundaries. L167: ensure it’s clear that its imputation based on taxonomy alone. R/ Done. L182: check references. R/ We reviewed the references cited at this point and confirm they are correct. L222-224 and throughout: phylogenetic diversity == Faith’s PD – the other measures are indices of phylogenetic distance/relatedness that are calculated in same units as PD, but are not phylogenetic diversity – that should be clarified. R/ Done. We clarified that Faith’s PD refers specifically to phylogenetic diversity, while the other metrics represent measures of phylogenetic relatedness or distance. L393: extinction risk should not be though of as a trait evolving but as the manifestation of extrinsic and intrinsic factors. R/ Agreed. We rewrote the sentence. L393-397: unclear what the relationships discussed are, and what they infer. R/ We have removed this section from both the Methods and Results. Given that the correlations discussed involved metrics dependent on branch length — and, as the reviewer previously pointed out, branch lengths can be affected by pruning the phylogenetic trees — we decided to eliminate this section. Overall, it did not substantially contribute to the text or to the discussion. L428-429: This is higher than, or at least comparable to, the global % of DD/NE squamates I think, so might not be considered relatively low for squamates. R/ We rewrote the sentence to clarify that it is comparable to or higher than the global percentage, as the reviewer correctly pointed out. L429-432: it might be worth highlighting how taxonomists and others can contribute to rapid reassessment of species with basic information in ecological publications see: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.01.022 R/ Done. We incorporated the reviewer’s suggestion. L442-444: Unclear what is meant here? A species can be assessed as CR with a wide range if its under population decline criteria, and a small-ranged species can be assessed as not-threatened if there is no evidence of decline/ongoing degradation. R/ This comment was also raised by Reviewer 1. We addressed it accordingly by revising the text to clarify that species can indeed have wide distributions and still qualify as Critically Endangered if facing significant threats, and vice versa. Please refer to our responses to Reviewer 1.",2025-11-19T21:19:50,,Daniel Vásquez-Restrepo,,,,

It seems a very antiquated model in terms of dealing with that many data points. The reality is we don't know much about living biological organisms that can potentially process that amount of data, human beings probably can't, let alone deal with anything moving faster than tradition UV wavelengths of light (with frequencies of about 400 nanometers). X-Rays obviously move faster than our ability to see them but that does not necessarily mean in curved space time, that theoretically an electron can't move faster than an X-Ray. Is it possible that Cesium Iodide, has the exact magnetic resonant frequency as x-rays, possibly. The fundamental problem seems to be understanding nature as it relates to cyber security. A whale and most marine life, are capable of generating a variety of different magnetic resonant frequencies to communicate as well as being able to swarm / flock around a central point in 3-dimensional space. Seems to me the central rotational point of a swarm / flock whether, birds, bees or fish as defined by AI swarm mathematics, such that the central node, is moved in virtual curved space dimensions of n where Riemannian manifold geometry no longer apply (say on a forwarded edge cache header of a content delivery network) this could be moved through this space at theoretically faster than x-ray speeds where c tends towards infinity. Ie move the theoretical swarm response center faster than light. This must be where modern cybersecurity must invariably end up such that AI ends up controlling the response to 1.8million malicious data points, or: conversely; 1.8million requests of benign agents, in terms of bandwidth limiting / load shedding. The notion of adversarial AI in either context largely becomes irrelevant. It will simply lie to protect itself and humanity at the same time. Any perceived threat against any aspect of humanity itself while it processes a faster response and solution to the entire 1.8 million data points of malicious attempts at denial of service, than could ever be neutralized in under 7 seconds It becomes naturally obvious that it is working in humanities interest and always will. As to the connection to whale brain functions and mice. I think it might be interesting to pose a question to the marine biologists of this world about their view regarding whale brains and how they generate sound, and magnetic resonant frequencies beyond the speed of sound, and potentially x-rays and yet they remain an endangered species?",2025-11-17T13:48:16,robertsonandy,"Robertson, Andy",,,,

Neutrophils are the most abundant immune cells in the body, outnumbering all other immune cells combined, so any analysis of tissue needs to identify them or explain why they are absent. It has already been demonstrated using single cell transcriptomics that neutrophils are not functioning properly in preeclampsia: Xiao S, Ding Y, Yu L, Deng Y, Zhou Y, Peng M, Lai W, Nie Y, Zhang W. Maternal-Fetal Interface Cell Dysfunction in Patients With Preeclampsia Revealed via Single-Cell RNA Sequencing. Am J Reprod Immunol. 2025 Sep;94(3):e70101. doi: 10.1111/aji.70101. PMID: 40924867. In pregnancy, the neutrophil fraction increases to 70% of all white blood cells (two neutrophils for every one other type). They are involved in all activities of the uterus including the build-up of the endometrium, spiral artery formation, the break down and expulsion of the endometrium, placental vascularization, cervical remodelling to enable the passage of the newborn, the expulsion of the placenta, the coagulation and diversion of the uterine arteries and the remodelling of the uterus back to its pre-pregnancy size and shape. I would go as far as to say that from an evolutionary point of view, the whole reason that primates have and make so many neutrophils is to support reproduction. The main issues with this work follow: 1.	PBMC should not be used as a control for immune cells in single cell transcriptomics of tissue as mononuclear cells do not represent the full identity or functionality of immune cells. 2.	In figure 1f, it should be possible to identify all of the clusters on the UMAP more precisely. For example, there are 2 clusters of “myeloid cells”. What are they? I don’t believe that they are both monocytes/macrophages. Monocytes and macrophages differ by only a small number of transcripts. The most widely accepted distinguishing surface protein is CD68. Why is this not used? 3.	Why is the UMAP for a preeclampsia sample not shown? 4.	CD16 should not be used to identify NK cells or CD16+ monocytes without additional markers. All neutrophils express CD16. 5.	Neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages are phagocytic and phagocytosis is key to their function. If a maternal phagocyte phagocytoses a fetal cell, the phagocyte will then contain both genotypes. Could this explain some of the observations in Figure 1? I hope that a more enlightened version of this manuscript – one that considers rolls of immune cells in placental development and function more broadly – will be published.

We have advised him, and we have significantly challenged him. He has diligently sought every possible way in which he might be wrong - he is his own most significant challenger. No one would be more pleased to see a solid data-driven disproof of any of his conclusions than he would. The fundamental difference in his bottom-up, data-driven no-hypothesis exploration of mitochondrial DNA versus prior analyses (such as in population genetics and genetic genealogy) is that those have been primarily based on point comparisons of mutations and indels. His consideration is based on the biology of the 3D structure of the mtDNA, specifically in how the palindromes that make up so much of the mtDNA shape that structure and thus the function of the mtDNA. All point mutations are not the same: for example, a point mutation in a palindrome can have either a non-viable result or else result in a mitochondrial DNA disease. He has sought and believes he has provided an objective reproducible method to explore mitochondrial DNA without preconceptions. If his method is valid, this alone is a major contribution, independent of what he has found about mtDNA. What the data has revealed and the conclusions he has made from the data very definitely challenge major beliefs about mtDNA. In genetic genealogy discussions I have seen, the reaction is defense of the status quo, with no real examination of the data discoveries underlying Dr. Stumpf's conclusions. This is not surprising but also not of any real help in verifying or refuting his conclusions. I hope that serious examination of his methods and data and analytical results and whether or not they support his conclusions will be presented here.",2025-11-14T16:06:36,disqus_qnONUSxcx5,Wesley Johnston,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.28.656644v1#comment-6796501259,biorxivstage,2,"Dear authors, as a part of a group activity aimed to improved our skills and growth as scientists, we discussed recent BioRxiv preprints that we found to be of particular interest. This time, our choice fell on your manuscript: - Gamarra M. et al., Vesicular Rps6 released by astrocytes regulate local translation and enhance synaptic markers in neurons. The comments below are the results of this exercise and reflects thoughts and comments of several people. We hope our exercise may help you to finalize your efforts and publish your manuscript in a good journal. Comments The manuscript by Gamarra et al. investigates the regulation of local translation in axons and the role that astroglia plays in it. The authors described, for the first time, a novel mechanism of intracellular communication in the central nervous system (CNS) based on the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are released from astrocytes and contain the ribosomal protein S6 (Rps6). The authors showed that these astrocyte-derived vesicular Rps6 are taken up by axons and are able to enhance synaptic markers and to fine-tune neuronal function. This work suggests that astrocyte EVs can actively influence neuronal local protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity through the transfer of specific non-neuronal ribosomal proteins, highlighting a novel mechanism for intercellular communication in the brain and opening new routes for therapeutic strategies based on EVs potential. Major comments 1.	Figure2 - Bi and 2Bii The heatmap in Figure 2Bi shows an increase the levels of both Rpl26 and Rps6 that is rather due to the introduction of astrocyte in the co-culture (NA condition) of both DMSO and Aβ1-42-treated samples. The box and whisker graphs in Figure 2Bii report the normalized levels of Rpl26 and Rps6 from the same experiments (analyzed by proteomics from 4 independent cultures). The normalized level of Rpl26 in Figure 2Bii matches the increment in Rpl26 level displayed in the heatmap in Figure 2Bi while the normalized level of Rps6 shows a discrepancy in DMSO NA conditions. It will be helpful to clarify and provide further justification of these representations in particular since, in the text, the author stated that - Conversely, Rps6, a component of the S40 subunit was upregulated only in Aβ-treated co-cultures and not in basal conditions (Figure 2Bii, right graph). This statement doesn’t match what is depicted in Figure 2Bii, right graph). We agreed that the difference is not significant but there is definitely a trend toward an upregulation of Rps6 levels also in the DMSO NA. 2.	Figure 4 – A The authors analyzed puromycin labelling in axon as a readout for local translation upon incubation with EVs released from DMSO and Aβ-treated astrocytes. The latter treatment, as shown in Figure 3 – C, increases the number of EVs released by astrocytes. We agreed that might be helpful to clarify whether the number of EVs were normalized or not. We believe it is key to the paper message to clarify whether the effects of astrocytes EVs on axonal local translation is due to EVs content rather than too their numbers. 3.	Figure 5 - Biii These conditions seem to give a lot of variability, with 2 out of 3 experiments showing a similar trend as is observed for Aβ-EVs in Figure 5 – Ciii. We thought that, in order to better convince the audience and prove your point of the absence of any effect in axonal translation upon incubation with EVs generated from DMSO treated astrocytes, it may be worth to perform a 4th replicate. 4.	Figure 5 – D and E and Figure 7 - C It will be of help to clarify why the author chose to quantify the number of synaptophysin (Syn) and Homer puncta. Are Syn and Homer known to be regulated by local protein translation? The authors claimed an axonal effect of EVs derived from Aβ-treated astrocytes. Why is a post-synaptic marker included? In case Homer staining was included to be sure to look at synapses, why do the authors not quantify Syn only from synaptophysin and Homer positive puncta? Minor comments •	A brief explanation on how well established the use of modified Boyden chamber is needed, especially in regard to possible direct contact between neurons and astrocytes due to the length of axons. •	The authors should consider using a single nomenclature throughout the manuscript for better clarity and readability.  For example, in Figures 1 and 2 a different notation is used for neuron monoculture (1 and N) and neuron-astrocyte co-cultures (2 and NA). •	Figure 1 - Bii - O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) is a tRNA analog that is incorporated in all newly synthesized proteins without a defined kinetics or a precise position in the aminoacidic sequence. From the immunoblot showed in Figure 1 – Bii, we would expect a smear in the lane cause newly synthesized protein should come in all different kDa. The same reasoning can be applied to the Amido Black staining. Why is it not the case? •	Figure 1 - Biii – The data suggests that OPP-biotin conjugates can be consistently and unambiguously detected in neurites isolated from neuron-astrocyte co-cultures independently from their exposure to Aβ treatment. OPP-biotin signal looks comparable in both DMSO and Aβ treated co-culture. •	Figure 1 – Ci – Out of curiosity, which is the common CC cluster found in both soma and neurite compartment?",2025-11-14T14:02:59,,Anonymous,,,,

The authors show that escape proceeds through narrow and predictable “escape funnels”, consistent with convergent mutations observed in SARS-CoV-2 variants. Combining generative RBM models with mean-field trajectory analysis enables quantitative estimates of path entropy and fitness cost. The model captures the direction of antigenic drift and enables prospective prediction of antibody escape, including for therapeutic cocktails: anti-correlated escape profiles force viruses onto longer, costlier routes. The model shows impressive predictive power. It demonstrates that, despite the potentially vast mutational landscape, the virus tends to follow a limited set of evolutionary routes, many of which are already observed in Omicron variants.

These loci mark only 0.05% of the genome but carry signatures of elevated mutation rate and ancient positive selection. HAQERs are enriched in ""bivalent chromatin states"" - regions poised between repression and activation. The same regions overlap GWAS loci for psychiatric, endocrine, and cancer-related traits, suggesting that the sequence changes shaping human-specific evolution also underlie modern disease susceptibility.

While similar to the results that some of these authors have presented in Botrytis and Sclerotinia, showing this in a genetic model organism would provide the genetic tools to dissect this phenomenon. However, the results presented here lack definitive proof. The evidence presented can be summarised as follows: 1) relatively low measured DNA per spore, based on DAPI fluorescence, compared to yeast 2) chromosome specific probes show patchy distribution across nuclei, compared to probes that target all chromosomes. The first line of evidence suffers from an apples-to-oranges comparison, because the comparison is across species. The compound DAPI binds to the AT regions of DNA, and so differences between species in both AT% as well as those that affect general fluorescence, will influence this measurement. For instance, yeast has 62% AT genome, while Neurospora has 46%. Highlighting the futility of such comparisons, the data in Figure 1C shows clearly that while N. crassa has a haploid genome that is 4 times as large as yeast (compare 1st and 3rd columns), the fluorescence signal is equal (compare 6th and 4th column). Even assuming the authors’ hypothesis, there is still ""too little"" fluorescence given the genome size of N. crassa. Clearly, while within a species there is a strong correlation between genome size and fluorescence, when compared across species such correlation disappears. The second evidence is from fluorescent hybridisation. Here the authors show that a FISH probe specific to chromosome 1 is never found in more than one nuclei, while a telomere probe that targets all chromosomes is more often found in multiple nuclei. The main issue is that the claims rely on negative evidence, that is to say the absence of signal. However, the absence of signal is not a strong signal of absence. FISH is a very sensitive process, and differences in probe design and washing steps can greatly affect the process. Highlighting this, in 14% of spores, the authors' own chromosome 1 specific probe does not bind to either nucleus. If this data was to be taken at face value, this would indicate 14% of spores lack Chr1, which would be inviable. Extrapolating across all chromosomes, we would only expect 36% of spores to have all chromosomes and be viable ((1-0.14)^7). Such low viability is inconsistent with observed spore viability of N. crassa, which generally exceeds 95%. An alternative explanation is that the probe binding is not very efficient. This is supported by the telomere probe, where it remained undetected in 10% of conidia , despite this probe targeting 14 different chromosomal regions!  Again, taken at face value this would indicate that a significant fraction of spore nuclei lack chromosomes entirely. Notably, only 64% of spores had all nuclei with signal from this telomere probe. Aside from inconclusive data, the claims here are also inconsistent with the basic empirical genetics of this fungus. It has been known for decades that when one wishes to isolate loss-of-function mutants in N. crassa, like the auxotrophic mutants used to demonstrate the ""one gene - one enzyme"" principle, regular macroconidia do not work. Instead, microconidia prove useful, allowing for the easy isolation of such mutants (Catcheside, 1954). This provides powerful evidence that macroconidia have redundant nuclei, which compensate for loss-of-function mutations (See Gross and Lester 1958 for further discussion). One only needs to read the experimental methods of Beadle and Tatum to see the effort in isolating auxotrophic mutants in this organism. Instead of simply mutagenizing conidia to obtain auxotrophs, they needed to use the extremely labour intensive purification process of individually crossing mutagenized conidia to a wild-type background, to be able to isolate homokaryotic ascospores (Beadle and Tatum; 1954). This is also true of genetic transformations, which are performed on macroconidia. Transformants always need to be purified, as the original colony that grows on selective medium generally contains a mix of transformed and untransformed nuclei. If the macroconidia would contain a single haploid genome, divided over multiple nuclei, as suggested by Tan et al, there would be no need to purify induced mutations. Further, the claims here are also inconsistent with the evolutionary dynamics of this fungus. This fungus is the foundation of the studies in heterokaryosis, the presence of multiple distinct genotypes within a single mycelia. Arising from either de novo mutations, or from fusion of two mycelial hyphae, such heterokaryons in Neurospora are quite stable. It is well-described that conidia can be heterokaryotic, meaning a single conidium inherits two distinct genotypes. This has been studied in detail for the soft mutation, where up to 40% of conidia are heterokaryotic, containing both the wild type and mutant alleles of the soft gene (Figure 2A; Grum-Grizmaylo et al. 2021). This is not due to specific dynamics of the soft mutation, as similar ratios of homokaryotic and heterokaryotic macroconidia have been observed in auxotrophs (Atwood and Mukai, 1955), which were used to form the current model of random segregation into multiple mitotic nuclei in Neurospora. A recent example of such evidence has been shown by Mela and Glass, who inserted either green or red fluorescence into the his3 locus in different genotypes, and using fluorescent microscopy they readily recover ±40% of conidia with both colors (Figure 1f; Mela and Glass, 2023). The claims made by Tan et al. are strong and in my opinion the evidence does not rise to the level needed. Measures like fluorescence intensity or hybridisation can never be definitive and therefore are at most a start of further experimentation. However, the predictions of incomplete chromosome sets per nuclei can be definitively tested through single nucleus sequencing. The technology has advanced to the level that single nuclei can be reliably processed for whole genome sequencing, which is the most reliable way to determine if these claims ultimately reflect reality.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.20.683404v1#comment-6793299565,biorxivstage,1,"Dear authors, at first, congratulations to this important findings. This data, paired with other ancient DNA evidence, can further clarify the demographic patterns of the peopling of Eastern Eurasia and Oceania, as well as their interactions with archaic human groups. Different deeply branching Denisovan components can be very useful data points for possible migration routes and or population substructure scenarios. In your pre-print, you argued for a possible earlier southern route into Oceania, followed by a later wave of the ancestors of South Asians (AASI) and East Asians, with East Asians via a possible northerly route: ""This supports an early migration of the ancestors of Oceanians through South Asia followed by the later arrival of the ancestors of present-day South Asians. East Asians do not share this Denisovan component in their genomes, suggesting that their ancestors arrived independently, perhaps by a northerly route"". One major problem with this scenario is the observed genetic affinity between the different ""basal Asian"" populations (e.g. Tianyuan, Önge, Hoabinhian, Xingyi_EN, Jōmon/Shiraho_27k, AASI, and Australasians/Oceanians such as Papuans); also known as ""eastern non-Africans"" (ENA) or ""East Eurasian Core"" (EEC). The aDNA data strongly suggest a single dispersal route and subsequent rapid diversification into multiple basal Asian lineages (presumably in the South-Southeast Asia region via a single Southern route). E.g. Oceanians/Papuans can successfully be modeled (qpAdm/qpWave) as simply Önge-like + additional Denisovan; or alternatively as Tianyuan-like + additional Denisovan. They do not fit as outgroup to ""West/East Eurasians"" either, but are nested within the ""Eastern"" clade (e.g cluster with Önge, Tianyuan, or present-day East Asians). Although it is possible to reproduce a signal affilated with a distinct earlier southern coastal route (proxied by ZlatyKun_45k); this wave however left only minor ancestry among present-day Oceanians/Papuans (and or South Asians), with the majority ancestry of them being derived from the same source as Önge or Tianyuan: e.g. ZlatyKun + Önge-like + extra Denisovan, in a 3–5%, 92–95%, and 2–3% ratio respectively. (qpGraph models allow higher ""early ancestry"" for Oceanians/Papuans: 12–24% when splitting before or at around the same time as ZlatyKun/Ranis, or up to 44% when splitting at the same time as Ust'Ishim.) Beyond that, a northern route entry for the ancestors of East Asians seems to be only partially possible, as the majority ancestry of East Asians seems to be from an Önge-like source (except Önge also used a northern route entry). This means that present-day eastern non-Africans (ENA) descend primarily from a single migration wave eastwards, presumably via a route South of the Himalayas; and which possibly absorbed an earlier less successfull wave, at least regionally (Oceania and South Asia). This may also have happened via a more substructured wave: e.g. both a southern coastal route (along the coast of the Indian subcontinent) and a southern interior route (via an interior route along the southern Himalayan mountain range) into Southeast Asia and beyond. – It is however well possible that the southern coastal wave pre-dated the southern interior wave, and thus display different Denisovan signals. E.g. timely separated migrations waves of a shared clade. Regional Denisovan admixture events (or their partial absence as in the case of Jōmon HGs [see the recent paper by Jiaqi Yang et al. 2025 ""An early East Asian lineage with unexpectedly low Denisovan ancestry""]) can be explained that way, without needing several different distinct waves, which would contradict the observed genetic affinities of the different Basal Asian lineages. The low Denisovan ancestry of Jōmon hunter-gatherers may or may not be affilated with the Shiraho_27k specimen, who appearently contributed some ancestry to later Jōmon. For more information on the Shiraho_27k specimen, please contact your co-author Svante Pääbo or Hideaki Kanzawa-Kiriyama. Note that Tianyuan40k can successfully be modeled as Önge-like + IUP-affilated admixture (BachoKiro_IUP); which fits the presence of IUP material sites in nearby NW China and Mongolia. Such IUP admixture has also been noted to explain the observed affinity to the GoyetQ116-1 specimen in Europe, which similarly can be modeled as Kostenki14/Sunghir_UP + BachoKiro_IUP (see Hajdinjak et al. 2021 ""Initial Upper Palaeolithic humans in Europe had recent Neanderthal ancestry""). It is possible that this Siberian IUP group absorbed the EA-specific Denisovan component and via its admixture into Tianyuan, contributed it to other Eastern Asians in lesser amount. – Present-day East Asians in turn can be successfully modeled as Tianyuan-like (c. 25%) + Önge-like (c. 75%); (see McColl et al. 2018 ""The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia"" for example). – Via Tianyuan-like or Denisovan-admixed IUP groups, this archaic ancestry may have also reached regions further West (as with the supposed Denisovan signal in Sunghir etc.). You can also review Bennett et al. 2024 ""Reconstructing the Human Population History of East Asia through Ancient Genomics"", a recent summary paper on the peopling of Eastern Asia and beyond; as well as Tianyi Wang et al. 2025 ""Prehistoric genomes from Yunnan reveal ancestry related to Tibetans and Austroasiatic speakers"". A summary of my points regarding your postulated ""earlier southern route"" for Oceanians and a possible ""northerly route"" for East Asians: • The available genetic data strongly suggests a single shared migration wave for the primary ancestral source of all eastern non-Africans (Papuans, AASI, East Asians, Önge/Hoabinhian, and Tianyuan). The presence of multiple deeply branching EEC lineages in Southeast Asia and southern China suggest it to be a major place of diversification from a shared ancestral source. • Papuans/Oceanians (and AASI) may have limited amounts of admixture from an earlier wave, but primarily share ancestry with Önge and Tianyuan. • Tianyuan can be modeled as either an admixture between Önge-like (61–67%) and BachoKiro_IUP-like (33–39%) ancestries; or represents a deep split from the rest of eastern non-Africans; although with some geneflow into later East Asians. • Ancient and present-day East Asians can be modeled as primarily Önge-like (c. 75%) with Tianyuan-like admixture (c. 25%). • The different Denisovan introgression events, if not shared, may have happened regionally to explain the observed affinities, but the differences in Denisovan components among each group. Below some qpAdm results on this (AADR v.62 + Ranis dataset); allsnps=TRUE: Model1 target: Papuan left: Hoabinhian, ZlatyKun, Denisovan right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, BachoKiro_IUP, Tianyuan, Önge, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Hoabinhian: 93,9%; ZlatyKun: 3,2%; Denisovan: 2,9%; p-value: 0.061 Model2 target: Papuan left: Japan_Jōmon, ZlatyKun, Denisovan right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, BachoKiro_IUP, Tianyuan, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Japan_Jōmon: 94,1%; ZlatyKun: 2,4%; Denisovan: 3,5%; p-value: 0.094 Model3 target: Tianyuan left: Önge, BachoKiro_IUP right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, Oase1_IUP, Papuan, Hoabinhian, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Önge: 65,5%%; BachoKiro_IUP: 34,5%%; p-value: 0.170 Model4 target: Japan_Jōmon left: Önge, Amur33k right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, BachoKiro_IUP, Tianyuan, Papuan, Hoabinhian, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Önge: 79,0%%; Amu33k: 21,0%; p-value: 0.053 Model5 target: Han_Chinese left: Önge, Amur33k right: Mbuti, Ranis13, Ust'Ishim, BachoKiro_IUP, Tianyuan, Papuan, Hoabinhian, Kostenki14, Sunghir_UP Results: Önge: 73,6%%; Amu33k: 26,4%; p-value: 0.090 Etc. (Önge = ONG Mondal; Jōmon = JpOd181/274/282). E.g. it is not likely that Oceanians were part of a distinct earlier wave into Oceania, separate from other mainland Asian groups, nor that East Asians reached East Asia along a distinct northern route (independently of Önge-like groups etc.). Next to qpAdm/qpWave or qpGraph models, f3/f4 statistics are quite clear on this. Papuans are (beyond their extra Denisovan ancestry and possible minor ""earlier group"" admixture) nested in eastern non-African diversity (e.g. EEC). It is plausible that after the OoA exit, and the IUP/EEC dispersals from a Hub on the Persian plateau, Eastern non-Africans (ENA/EEC) shared a secondary Hub somewhere in Northwest India, from which Oceanians expanded first, via a coastal route towards Oceania. Along the coast of the Indian subcontinent (South India?), they absorbed the Deep Denisovan ancestry and continued to expand to Oceania. – Some time afterwards, the remainder ENA/EEC group (residual) expanded along an interior route South of the Himalayas into Southeast Asia and Southern China; not admixing with the Deep Denisovan group. – There, one branch split and head towards Japan (low Denisovan), while another group headed northwards coming into contact with IUP groups & the EA-specific Denisovan (Denisovan3-like) component (=Tianyuan_40k); while the remainder absorbed a local Denisovan group in Southern China or Southeast Asia (=Önge-like). – This Önge-like groups expanded back into South Asia/India, absorbing the group with Deep Denisovan introgression (becoming the AASI). The Önge-like groups staying in Southeast Asia became the Hoabinhians, while early East Asians formed along a cline of Tianyuan-like and Önge-like ancestries. Of course the above scenario is just one of many possibilities; it is well possible that Oceanians used a southern route, while the ancestors of both East Asians and Önge used as northerly route. – Or any other scenario which can  explain the aDNA data and genetic affinities. My suggestion is to define a model which alignes with both aDNA data and archaic components (for ancient and present-day populations), as well as, if possible, archaeologic and paleoenvironmental evidence. E.g. including a set of ancient and present-day groups to test on their Denisovan components and their overall genetic affinities (not just modern groups to prevent bias from ancient geneflow events): For South Asians: AASI-rich tribal groups from Southern India, such as Irula and Paniya; for SEA: Önge, Hoabinhians; for EA: the newly analyzed Xingyi_EN samples, Jōmon, Longlin, Amur14k, Qihe3, Tianyuan and Amur33k, as well as present-day East/Southeas Asians; for Oceania: Papuans, Australians, and Aeta. Maybe a chart comparing shared/distinct Denisovan components and f3/f4 statistics of each test group to each other would help clarify the exact affinities, shared routes or geneflow events. Perhaps, your co-author Svante Pääbo can share informations on the Shiraho_27k specimen and its Denisovan components. A strong model should explain the genetic data/affinities of ancient/present-day populations, their different Denisovan components, and in best case also include archaeologic and paleoenvironmental data. To determine the influence of ancient geneflow, comparison between ancient specimens could help (Tianyuan vs Önge vs Jōmon vs Longlin vs Amur14k etc.). I hope this information can help to tangle out some possible scenarios on the dispersal, contact and introgression events for the different deeply branching Denisovan components and present-day Asian populations. Or maybe inspire future studies on this topic. I am looking forward for the publication of your paper and more exciting findings! Thank you.

Neither the title nor the Abstract tells us the species under study (mice). The first mention seems to be in Methods. The Introduction does not specify the animal species used in the literature cited (mostly rats, I suppose). Some of the literature citations are erroneous. Here, I focus on two sentences, as follows. ""Nicotine is another widely abused drug that both acts on dopamine circuits and has been widely shown to decrease food intake (Iravani, 1972; Passey et al., 1961; Schechter & Cook, 1976)."" This sentence requires qualification. Any effect of nicotine on food intake will depend critically on the dose, on acute vs. chronic administration, etc. These three literature citations fail to support the above statement: Iravani 1972 exposed rats to cigarette smoke, not to nicotine per se. It is hardly surprising that the rats lost weight in this 1972 study, as they were reported to show sniffing and sneezing, with post-mortem examination revealing airways filled with ""highly purulent fluid"". It seems unlikely that this study would obtain ethical approval these days. Passey et al 1961 is from a charity campaign document, which I could not find online and is almost certainly not peer-reviewed. Schechter & Cook, 1976 actually reported the opposite of what is claimed here. This earlier study also used a very high dose of nicotine (0.8 mg/kg expressed as base). Such a dose is near the threshold for producing seizures, and would have given plasma levels of nicotine approximately 10 times higher than in smokers. There are probably dozens of solid papers that could have been cited on nicotine's effects on feeding behaviour in laboratory rats. Not all of these studies suggest that nicotine reduces food intake, especially at doses that might be smoking-relevant. ""As with amphetamine, nicotine’s effects on feeding under normal ad libitum feeding conditions has been broadly studied, but its potential effects on the rewarding and motivational qualities of food are unknown.""

One aspect that would greatly strengthen the diagnostic claim is the absence of quantitative viral-load information for the 30 nasopharyngeal swab samples in UTM. The preprint reports only RT-qPCR ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ classifications, without Ct values or titers. Without these data, it remains unclear whether any of the MSD-positive samples represented low viral loads, which is critical for benchmarking clinical sensitivity. Providing Ct values (or approximate genomic copy numbers) for each specimen would substantially increase confidence in the specificity and real-world performance, and this could be gathered within a few days.",2025-11-03T17:39:06,,Ivan Brukenr,,,,

(Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), a putative new parasitoid of Diaphorina citri discovered during a classical biological control program in Cyprus. Congratulations on this interesting contribution to the taxonomy and biological control of psyllid pests. If I may, I would like to respectfully draw your attention to a publication that may be relevant to your study: Burckhardt, D., Yefremova, Z.A., & Yegorenkova, E. (2015). Diaphorina teucrii sp. nov. and its parasitoid Tamarixia dorchinae sp. nov. from the Negev desert, Israel ( Zootaxa 3920 (3): 463–473). I apologise for the self-reference, but given the biogeographical proximity and the relevance of the Israeli Tamarixia fauna to the region, it was somewhat surprising not to see it cited. In Israel, we have documented five native species of Tamarixia, including T. dorchinae, which shares several morphological characters with what you describe as T. citricola, particularly in forewing and antennal structure across sexes. A comparative discussion of these taxa might offer further insights into whether the specimens from Cyprus are truly distinct species. A discussion comparing the putative new species with other taxa in the region is warranted anyway. Additionally, I think that host specificity in Tamarixia isgenerally more consistent  with psyllid host genus rather than the associated plant. This ecological pattern may be worth emphasizing in your discussion. We are in the process of barcoding the Tamarixia species of Israel, and a comparison with your material would be most useful. Thank you again for sharing this work,",2025-11-03T07:59:20,zoyayefremova,Zoya Yefremova,,,,
