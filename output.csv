Makes a lot of sense considering time scales, with longer responses involving GPCR-induced NOS activation (e.g. by Ach in endothelium). Wondering what contribution endothelial NO has vs. neuronal NO... Would be nice to dissect major cell types (endo, astro, neurons). I suggest changing the title to ""Neuronal nitric oxyde is not (...)"" just to stay on the safe side.

This should probably be corrected to allow for only or mostly synonymous mutations. We also did look at only synonymous mutations and found significantly increased mutation rates BsaI/BsmBI sites, as expected for a reverse genetics system. Can you recomment any tool to simulate only synonymous mutations?

According to the defuse proposal, WIV researchers planned to use commercial gene blocks, which when bought from genscript, the largest provider, are much more expensive and take much longer to produce when >8kb. So in this case, anything up to 8kb would be ok. If this 3rd BsmBI site was removed, that fragment would be >8kb. Only fragments below 100bp become tricky to handle. Our Table S2 shows that it is not easy to place these sites with minimal interventions, e.g. the BsaI sites can only be introduced exactly were they are if one wants to manipulate S1 and avoid >8kb fragments.

We have briefly described that this design is ideal for later manipulating a region of interest, such as the RBD and FCS in the spike. Eg the WIV planned to test many combinations of RBDs and FCSs in bat-coronaviruses. If the sites are left in the genome, one can use them to only substitute the S1-containing fragment in the fully assembled DNA genome, which is much more efficient than trying to assemble 10 or 20 complete genomes.

Since the results are largely based on antibodies that are specific to each NPR1, NPR2 and NPR3, and since these three proteins have some sequence homology, then some additional information on the antibodies may be needed to robustly confirm this intriguing conclusion. Are the NPR antibodies monoclonal, and what region of each protein is recognized? What would also help would be to show the full lane for each blot, ideally including size markers. The anti-NPR3 blots appear to cut off where the anti-NPR1 signal runs, and vice-versa. Each antibody could be validated for recognition of its specific target, and lack of recognition of the other two homologous targets. The validations are needed only for whichever of the three methods (western, immunoprecipitation, or immunohistochemistry) was used for that antibody. It would also help to explain if the p62 protein is a receptor protein and to confirm that p62 is in the cell membrane fraction, like NPR1, NPR2 and NPR3. Also, the dimer is one possible form of the NPR enzymes. The few studies that have been done with purified, active mammalian NPR have identified a tetramer for NPR1 (PMID: 1657900 & 35821229). Eventually, it will be interesting to see if NPR3 forms a heterotetramer or a heterodimer with NPR1 and NPR2.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.165217v2#comment-6033622699,biorxivstage,0,"Erin Schuman Jan 7, 2021 While initial reports argued that emetine was required to stabilize the interaction of puromycylated peptides with ribosomes, some recent studies of local protein synthesis via the puromycylation method relied on treatment with puromycin alone for ~5–10 min, with the implication that detected nascent proteins do not appreciably diffuse away from their site of synthesis (i.e. ribosome) within the treatment time (Colombo et al., 1965; tom Dieck et al., 2015; Morisaki et al., 2016). To determine how far a nascent protein might diffuse on these timescales (i.e. the spatial resolution of the method), we calculated the expected displacement as a function of time, based on the previously measured diffusion coefficient of GFP in the cytosol (Di Rienzo et al., 2014; Figure 5). This calculation depends on the dimensionality of space in which the molecule is confined. However, even in the most limiting case of one-dimensional diffusion—approximating movement along a very narrow neural projection—a protein is expected to diffuse ~100 µm in less than 1 min. This distance is large compared to both the scale of the relevant structures to which protein synthesis was localized in neurons (tens of microns) (tom Dieck et al., 2015; Biever et al., 2020), and to the diameter of HeLa cells (~20 microns) (Borle, 1969), in which the method was demonstrated (David et al., 2012). Thus, limiting puromycin treatment time to a few minutes does not ensure that nascent proteins remain confined to the subcellular region in which they are synthesized. More Using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) diffusion in CHO cells as a model for endogenous protein diffusion is not the most appropriate. In non-native cells, the diffusion of GFP is influenced by molecular crowding of its environment, as it likely does not have any abundant endogenous protein interaction partners (e.g. aequorin). For example, the GFP diffusion value cited by Enam et al. in Figure 5, (dark green line in our linked Figure), derived from studies in CHO cells, is much faster than the GFP diffusion values obtained in neuronal compartments like axons (light green line in Figure) (Reshetniak et al., 2020). In fact, and even better, there are direct data available on the diffusion of puromycylated peptides in a neuron-derived cell line (Ge et al., 2016) (purple line in Figure). The diffusion of puromycylated peptides measured directly in Ge et al., is ~ 10-fold slower than the diffusion of cytosolic GFP in CHO cells shown in Figure 5 of Enam et al. In addition, many groups have directly studied the diffusion of neuronal proteins in mature neurons- and again found diffusion values that are much slower than cytosolic GFP in the same subcellular compartment (grey line in Figure). As such, we believe that puromycin, when used appropriately, can be used in neurons to ascertain or validate the location of nascent proteins in or near the compartment (axonal or dendritic) in which they were synthesized. Practically speaking, measurements should be made in distal processes (e.g. > 50 microns from the cell body) following short-labelling times (~ 5 min) using a low (~2 – 5 uM) puromycin concentration– these are the typical parameters used by most experimenters, including our group. link to Figure: https://schumanlab.github.i...

For the record, my collaborators and I published the following some time ago (J Med Genet 2006;43:211–217. doi: 10.1136/jmg.2005.036160): ""Presumably, the CHD7 protein plays an important role in chromatin remodelling during early development and allows a level of epigenetic control over target genes expressed in mesenchymal cells derived from the cephalic neural crest. We analysed the expression pattern of the CHD7 gene during early human development. CHD7 is widely expressed in the undifferentiated neuroepithelium and in mesenchyme of neural crest origin. Towards the end of the first trimester it is expressed in dorsal root ganglia, cranial nerves/ganglia, and auditory, pituitary, and nasal tissues as well as in the neural retina."" The involvement of some of the transcription factors of interest in the present work (SOX10, FOXD3, CHD7), were also established in human neural crest and other embryonic tissues in this early transcriptomics paper back in 2008 (Hum Mol Genet. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddn235): ""We finally examined the spatial expression of a selection of genes identified by SAGE using in situ hybridization on human embryo sections at C13 (Fig. 4). SOX11 and MAZ code for transcription factors and GJA1 for a critical gap junction protein; other genes we studied (not shown) include the transcription factors SOX10 (24), ZEB2 (25) and CHD7 (26) and HEYL; the receptors encoded by NOTCH2 and FGFR2; and the cytoskeleton-associated CTNNB1 and MID1 (27). All were expressed in both the neuroepithelium and NCC, with the exception of SOX10, which only postmigratory hNCC appeared to express at C13. (...) As in animals, SOX10 (24) and FOXD3 (Fig. 3) appeared to be more expressed by early postmigratory hNCC than the neural tube.""

(1) Unfortunately JunctionSeq is not available in the current Bioconductor release (it appears to not be actively supported), so it would be difficult for me to implement any options to adapt it into the SpliceWiz pipeline (due to compatibility issues, etc). Nevertheless, as I understand, JunctionSeq utilises both exon and junction reads which is a different philosophy than that of SpliceWiz which only uses junctions (except in IR). One issue with STAR's SJ.out.tab is that when read pairs overlap a region that contains a splice junction, that junction is counted twice! In SpliceWiz, read pairs are treated as fragments and so coverage is not double-counted. This is also another feature in our coverage plots: unlike IGV, coverage from overlapping read pairs are not counted twice. Conceptually, read-pairs arise from the same RNA molecule, so the coverage and junction counts should not be counted twice. I'm not familiar with QoRTs and whether or not it suffers from the same issue. SpliceWiz treats included and excluded reads as separate matrices, and GLM-based contrasts in DESeq and limma wrappers evaluate the interaction between these matrices and the contrasting variable as their readouts. A helpful explanation of this approach by the DESeq2 author can be found here: http://rstudio-pubs-static.... In the end, users would choose a tool based on a number of factors - ease of use, ease of experimental validation of the detected signals, ease of user understanding of how the data is wrangled. SpliceWiz offers a simplistic view of splicing using the traditional concept of it being a binary event (e.g. skipped vs included cassette exons, etc), which is (hopefully) easy to understand for researchers. This may well be at the expense of detecting complex (more-than-one-step) splicing events which is one limitation. (2) Although our group's prior contribution (IRFinder) assesses""all"" introns as putative IR events (a good assumption at the time as IR was relatively unknown back then), SpliceWiz makes the distinction of annotated vs unannotated IR in that annotated IR means a transcript from the GTF contains an exon that fully overlaps an intron in another transcript. This is useful for the purposes of benchmarking using simulators like flux-simulator, where our input is transcript_id and TPM values (meaning it can't simulate IR events if the IR-transcript is not already annotated). We discovered our annotation approach discovered 3x more annotated IR events than rMATS and SUPPA2, and Figure S4 essentially explains why. We don't believe these extra annotated events affects false positive rates (I agree it would be useful to formally test this!). The reason is the general principle of assessing ASEs as""local"" events - which is based on the assumption the event occurs independently of other ASEs outside the locus. Whether the other end(s) of the exons of the IR event is differentially spliced should not be relevant to the IR at the intron of interest.

Regarding polygenes, they cite a 1992 paper of Naveira (2), rather than his 1998 summary of work carried out with Maside (3). They appreciate my drawing this to their attention and have suggested that readers of their preprint paper would appreciate a formal comment. At issue is whether, when genomically dispersed, the term “polygenes” should be interpreted as “many genes,” or something else. Pondering why incompatibility factors are so dispersed they write (1): “One of our key findings is that many factors of perhaps individually small effects are widely dispersed across autosomes or on the Z chromosome. Consequently, average chromosomal ancestry is often more informative of phenotypes than any particular locus. This pattern is similar to the polygenic threshold model of hybrid incompatibility in Drosophila, where abnormal phenotypes depend more on the total quantity of introgression than where introgression occurs in the genome [41, 42, 43].” Their first reference here “[41]” is to Naveira’s 1992 report on polygenic effects causing sterility in male fruit fly hybrids. However, they do not mention his subsequent detailed studies with Maside that were summarized in 1998 (3). These concluded that, rather than genes per se, “it might be only a question of foreign DNA amount.” Thus, “experiments on the nature of these polygenes suggest that the coding potential of their DNA may be irrelevant.” The Naviera-Maside hypothesis was cited in a 2000 paper on Haldane's rule (4), but it has been largely overlooked in the literature. There appears to be no discussion of the hypothesis in the paper of Xiong et al. (1), even though the case for it has grown appreciably (5). It is also important in view of their paper's opening remarks on ""the sex with the greatest fitness costs."" Fitness usually implies genes. However, sterility and fitness do not necessarily go together. A mule is sterile but very fit. So being ""fit"" is subtle and it may be unwise to imply that a sterile organism is necessarily unfit, especially when that sterility is considered ""largely phenomenological."" Thus, it is good that Xiong et al. write of ""incompatability factors"" rather than of ""incompatability genes"" (1), which implies phenotypes.

When the changes were evaluated in our tumor samples it appears that multiple changes resulted from incorrect mapping of the sequence reads. For example, the PHF2 variants, which occurred at the first 2 bases of intron 16, corresponded to the first 2 bases of exon 17. These are visible in IGV when soft clipping is turned off, and the first 5 bases that were proposed to be intronic also matched the first 5 bases of exon 17, which is indicative of the problem of mapping RNA-seq reads properly. This was not true of all of the changes, as the G>A changes in NEIL1 mapped to exonic sequences, but we also have transcriptome data from matched normal tissue samples from 1 of our patients where expression of these variants was observed. This is another issue that has not to my knowledge been adequately addressed, as normal tissues express ADAR, indicating that these changes may not be tumor-specific. Finally, there is the issue of the high error rate of reverse transcription, which may not occur equally at all sites. This is a problem that is not easy to resolve, unless these changes are directly probed, which would seem like a good way of potentially validating these changes.",2022-11-02T18:28:17,disqus_1ruehpT9ca,Paul Robbins,10.1101/2022.09.17.508207,Proteogenomic analysis reveals RNA as an important source for tumor-agnostic neoantigen identification correlating with T-cell infiltration,"Celina Tretter, Niklas de Andrade Krätzig, Matteo Pecoraro, Sebastian Lange, Philipp Seifert, Clara von Frankenberg, Johannes Untch, Florian S Dreyer, Eva Bräunlein, Mathias Wilhelm, Daniel P Zolg, Thomas Engleitner, Sebastian Uhrig, Melanie Boxberg, Katja Steiger, Julia Slotta-Huspenina, Sebastian Ochsenreither, Nikolas von Bubnoff, Sebastian Bauer, Melanie Boerries, Philipp J Jost, Kristina Schenck, Iska Dresing, Florian Bassermann, Helmut Friess, Daniel Reim, Konrad Grützmann, Katrin Pfütze, Barbara Klink, Evelin Schrock, Bernhard Haller, Bernhard Kuster, Matthias Mann, Wilko Weichert, Stefan Fröhling, Roland Rad, Michael Hiltensperger, Angela M Krackhardt",2022-09-18

Rajpar et al. bioRxiv 2022 doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.05.... We reviewed this preprint as a part of Arcadia Science's preprint review initiative. Collated comments follow: In this preprint, Rajpar et al. identify a novel role for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in mechanical load-induced bone accrual. The authors conditionally deleted TLR4 from Ocn-Cre-expressing cells (which primarily target mature osteoblasts and osteocytes). Ocn-conditional TLR4 deletion had negligible effect on baseline bone phenotype, but abrogated the effects of ulnar loading on periosteal and endosteal bone formation in both male and female mice. Prior papers from the lab demonstrated that nerve growth factor (NGF) expression by periosteal cells is upregulated by loading. Here, they show that periosteal NGF expression in loaded bones is reduced by the NF-kB inhibitor, BAY 11-7082, and that loading increases the number of TLR4+ periosteal cells in WT mice. Complementary in vitro experiments in MC3T3 cells and primary osteoblasts, showed that both NFkB and TLR4 inhibition abrogated the increase in NGF expression induced by in vitro mechanical stimulation (by fluid shear stress). Finally, the authors use bulk RNA seq to compare the transcriptomic profiles of loaded or non-loaded limbs in TLR4 knockouts and wildtype mice. Overall, these new data are exciting and implicate a novel role for a classic inflammatory signaling cascade in bone mechanoadaptation. However, we found that the structure of the paper, written with NGF as the starting point, is challenging to follow for naïve readers unfamiliar with the prior NGF studies and obscures the key finding (viz., TLR4). The authors could adapt the flow described above to make it an easier read and to emphasize the novelty and impact. Several experiments in the paper feature insufficient sample size or missing data, whose addition would improve the strength of the conclusions that can be made. Specific comments: 1.	Immunostaining in Fig 1 shows NGF:eGFP expression in the periosteum. This is qualitative; it would be better to quantify the number of eGFP+ cells and show this as a percentage of the total number of cells in the region of interest, for both loaded and non-loaded bones. While built on prior results, display and quantification of both loaded and non-loaded bones is important to demonstration the extent to which the BAY inhibitor reduces NGF expression to non-loaded baseline levels. 2.	The qPCR data in Fig 1 C-F are not adequately powered. A minimum of 3 mice per treatment group must be analyzed for statistical analysis. 3.	It is not clear how the ∆∆Ct values in Fig. 1 C-F are normalized. This information appears to be missing. 4.	An explanation of the kinetics of NGF and TRL4 analysis would help. NGF-EGFP expression is analyzed 3 hours post loading and TLR4 positivity is analyzed at 7 days. 5.	Figure 2 is presented as relative values, and non-loaded images are not shown. It took us a while to understand this figure. It would be clearer and more rigorous to show all four groups – Non-loaded WT, Loaded WT, Non-loaded cKO and loaded cKO on the same graph, along with corresponding representative images. These data are included in table 2, but tables are always harder to interpret compared to the main figure. Statistical comparison using repeated measures ANOVA would preserve matching and account for animal-animal variability. 6.	Scale bars are missing on the images in Fig 2. 7.	Figure 3 provides important support for the TLR4-NGF connection, especially with TAK-242 inhibition. The use of two orthogonal NFkB inhibitors to show the same effect is robust. Adding figure labels or illustrations to clarify the cell types used in each panel will add clarity. 8.	The timeline is missing from Fig 3A. 9.	The sample size for experiments in Fig 3 is unclear. Showing individual data points for independent samples, including for controls, is important. 10.	Addition of a diagram/illustration to Figure 3 to indicate the fluid shear stress conditions would add clarity. “Load” should be changed to FSS (Fluid Shear Stress) in this figure. 11.	The RNA-seq analysis in Figures 4, 5, 6 is unclear and does not show the comparisons most relevant to the study. We recommend re-analysis using the following comparisons: A.	Effect of load: Loaded WT vs Non-loaded WT. Which pathways are regulated by loading? B.	Effect of TLR4-cKO on pathways identified in (A) as load-induced pathways: Loaded WT vs Loaded cKO. Are the same pathways that were up/down due to loading still up/down after the KO? C.	NGF-signaling: the in vitro data show NGF expression is abrogated by TLR4 inhibition. But in the RNA-seq data, NGF remains significantly upregulated by loading in cKO mice. Whether this upregulation in the knockouts is due to the heterogeneity of the lysed cells in the tissue or is actually relatively lower than the upregulation of NGF by loading in WT mice is not shown. Comparison of the effect of loading on NGF induction in WT and cKO mice could answer this. If NGF signaling is reduced in cKO mice, compared to WT, RNA-seq would be the ideal method to look for signatures of altered signaling downstream of NGF.

Although tobacco smoking is a prevalent problem, not much research dives into how it affects human physiology on a cellular level. I appreciate your efforts to explore this topic on a deeper level. The title of the paper and objectives of the study stated in the paper claim to explore the effects of cigarette smoke on neurodegeneration and reactive oxygen species, however, there is a less definite link between these topics and inflammatory markers. These topics are not fully explored in this paper. More specifically, reactive oxygen species are not explored to the depths in which EVs were explored, yet it was stated in the paper, “cigarette smoke induces a series of mechanisms that activate cell populations from both the innate and the adaptive immunity, which in turn promote the secretion of multiple inflammation-related molecules such as proinflammatory cytokines including chemokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and extracellular vesicles...” Reactive oxygen species were not explored sufficiently to claim that cigarette smoke can activate ROS. The lack of exploration of key topics mentioned in the beginning of the paper, make the overall study over-promising in combination with a lack of data to back up the paper’s claims. For future studies, it would be helpful to see how ROS is affected in EV-secreting cells post smoking a cigarette to have a better understanding of cigarette smoke on ROS. The data that is available in this paper seems to be more descriptive than quantitative and has difficulty showing significance to claims that are being made. There is also a lack of controls in your data which make the existing data and claims unreliable. Perhaps in Figure 1 and 2, it would have been helpful to take blood from the smokers after smoking to compare the data and ensure what you are seeing is significant. In addition some of the claims that are in this paper are very generalized. It is important to understand how different demographics are impacted by cigarette smoke physiologically. Might I suggest, for a future direction, conducting more testing data to see if there are any statistically significant differences in physiological response for individuals of different  demographics. (For example, age, BMI, gender, ethnicity/cultural background, diabetic/non diabetic, etc. Once again, thank you for posting this paper.

Through examples they show that the distribution of points in this representation correlates with resolution and data collection temperature of the structures. They also construct the RoPE space of a protein using time-resolved experiment datasets and show that minor changes in the linear coordinate space are clearly observed in the RoPE space. This work demonstrates the utility of a non-linear representation of the conformational space in visualizing changes throughout the structure which are originally considered subtle. This work is very interesting and can have significant impact on ensemble studies on protein structures and in crystallization/cryo-EM and fragment screening efforts by showing the impact of temperature and resolution. The manuscript is very concise (perhaps too concise?) and well written. Major points: 1. In Page 3, para 2, the author states differences associated with data collection temperature is preserved across space groups for trypsin and lysozyme but Figure 1(a) and 1(b) marks different space groups only for lysozyme and not for trypsin 2.The section on carboxymyoglobin has some unclear statements: (a) “The RoPE space of these structures showed that, over the first three picoseconds, two torsion angle modes are sufficient to represent a clear trajectory during release of carbon monoxide”. Fig 1(e) does show a trajectory from -0.1ps to 3.0 ps but it is not clear how two torsion modes are sufficient to build the trajectory. (b)“The last three timepoints, 10 ps, 50 ps and 150 ps, are therefore beyond the biologically relevant timescales for CO dissociation in myoglobin and in-line with this, they did not strongly correlate with any other timepoints in RoPE space”. We are confused about which figure/data supports this non-correlation. Is it to be interpreted from Fig 1(e)? If yes, then the author should describe what is correlation and non-correlation in the context of this figure. (c) The section on “mapping motion back onto structure” in the methods makes it unclear why the scaling is normalized to 1degree and how that might bias the magnitude of motion observed in Figure 2a (+/- 0.3 A) 3. We tried running some analysis on the RoPE website but it was either unclear how to go about submitting a job or the website became unresponsive after clicking on “view conformational space”. The author can provide a run-through of the website usage with some examples. 4. It is unclear how important the vagabond refinement performed here is in the clustering. How would figure 1a, b look, for example, if the PDB or PDB-REDO models were subjected to ROPE without further refinement? 5. At the end of the SVD, it should be possible to project the contributions for each SV back onto the torsion angles most responsible for the differences. It would be interesting to plot that for BPTI and lysozyme to identify the torsions/areas leading to the greatest differences across temperatures. Minor points: 1. There are some gray colored points in Figure 1(a) and 1(b) which are not accompanied by a legend and their significance not explained. 2. To highlight the advantage of RoPE space, the author can show clustering of the same protein chains when clustered based on RMSD. The crowding of points when using RMSD vs. the separation of points when using torsion angles can make the utility of RoPE space obvious to the reader. - Ashraya Ravikumar and James Fraser, UCSF",2022-10-31T05:04:22,,Ashraya Ravikumar,10.1101/2022.08.04.502807,Torsion angles to map and visualize the conformational space of a protein,Helen Mary Ginn,2022-08-05

Walsh et al used CRISPR genome editing to tag the endogenous LOV-1 protein at both the N-terminus (mScarlet) and C-terminus (mNeonGreen). Figure 1 clearly shows that the N and C tagged fragments have different localisation patterns. The N and C terminal tagged fragments also displayed different transport dynamics (Figure 4). When a point mutation that is predicted to prevent cleavage (C2181S) was introduced in the mScarlet::LOV-1::mNeonGreen strain the localisation of LOV-1 was severely disrupted. Interestingly the the N-termini of LOV-1 was enriched in the cilia of three ray neurons suggesting that some cleavage can still occur in this mutant. Taken together this body of work presents strong evidence that LOV-1 is processed in C. elegans. The mScarlet::LOV-1::mNeonGreen strain will be a very useful tool for use in future studies to model conserved ciliopathy variants. I would predict that missense variants in the N or C terminal fragment do not affect the function of the other. Modelling these variants will help to elucidate disease mechanisms. One concern I have is whether or not the double tagged LOV-1 protein is fully functional. I can see in Figure 3D/F that the mating efficiency with unc-52 and the response behaviour is not significantly different from wild-type. However, I do not see the comparison to wild-type in the dpy-17 mating efficiency assay (Figure 3E).

Consideringnew Omicron variants currently evolving further from BA.4 or BA.5, this would further support the use of the bivalent vaccines. In addition, the study tested only the antibody (B-cell) response. It is reasonable to expect also a specific T-cell response.

But equally, there are cases where integration results in autoactivity, like those highlighted in this work. Our goal here was to address specific cases where autoactivity arose from manipulation of the integrated domain in the Pikm-1 chassis, and to provide methods of addressing this. We are yet to determine definitive rules that describe/predict whether an integration will cause autoactivity, and as such there is an element of trial and error in the approach at present. In this regard, some pikobodies can be incorporated into the Pikm-1 chassis without autoactivity - but this isn’t contradictory, especially as shown in the supplement of Kourelis et al., where there are several different nanobodies trialled that did result in autoactive phenotypes.

One alternative interpretation is that the apoplastic conditions are different between these species, and therefore these SCPSs mutants/fragments may behave differently depending on the species.

This is demonstrated using T-DNA knockout lines, complementation, and CoIP. The authors show that SCPSs-like effectors from fungi other than S. sclerotiorum, oomycete and bacterial pathogens are also recognized by RLP30. In addition, they also show that SCPSs is recognized by different plant species. Based on sequence similarity to VmE02, the authors identify that the N. benthamiana receptor RE02 (also known as NbCSPR) can also recognize SCPSs. The authors then go on to delineate the recognized peptide from SCPSs, showing there is variation between plant species in the ability to recognize fragments derived from SCPSs. Finally, the authors show that RLP30 can also recognize an unknown elicitor found in small molecule fractions from Pseudomads, unlike the NbRE02. We enjoyed reading this well-written paper!

This would enable many new lines of questioning. Are MigPSY peptides triggering an immune response or mediating any sort of PTI-like response (i.e. triggering a ROS burst) in any root knot nematode hosts (i.e. rice)? How do plant receptors (such as Xa21) distinguish between endogenous and parasite derived PSY peptides? What are the molecular determinants for this specificity? It would be super interesting to study the potential co-evolutionary arms race between pathogen PSYs and host receptors. How did plant pathogens acquire PSY peptide mimics, evolutionarily speaking? Do non-plant pathogenic nematodes also have PSY peptides? Is it possible that non-plant pathogenic nematodes also produce these or similar peptides for other unrelated endogenous processes and then these were co-opted over evolutionary time to fulfil a role in pathogenesis?",2022-10-26T10:34:06,mauriciocontreras4,Mauricio P.

I think that this article was incredibly effective in proving the points hypothesized in the introduction and abstract. All of the information in the article tied back to information first brought up in the introduction, which helped me as the reader follow along and see the significance of the information being provided. I also appreciate how clearly the thesis statement is addressed in the introduction of the paper. The main idea of the paper is that physicochemical factors largely contribute to the phylogeny of aquatic bacteria. This is proven by the methods mentioned in the thesis, which is a phylogenetic and MAGs analysis. Although the purpose of this paper was briefly mentioned in the introduction as relating to climate change and understanding how changing environmental conditions might affect bacteria, the authors could have been a bit more explicit about how these findings affect this field of study. I would rate the significance of this paper as a modest contribution, because although the authors did tie its importance to climate change, more context regarding its place in the field would allow me to have a better understanding of its significance. The findings are important for understanding how climate change affects ecosystems and the organisms such as bacteria living within them, but again, more context would help in understanding the gravity of these findings. The methodology in this paper is convincing, and the only area I find questionable is the validity of MAGs in acting as an accurate representation of bacterial genomes.

The writing quality is a particular strength of this paper, and I thought the figures and thought process behind the data collection was well communicated to the reader.

It was very educational and understandable, even with limited knowledge of the field of Trypanosomes and parasitology. The contribution of the paper to really delve into the immunogenic capabilities of antigen variability of Trypanosoma is really providing a different perspective as to how it undergoes immune evasion. This detail really aided in surmising the paper's focal target of Trypanosoma responding to cells within extravasuclar spaces and their respective capabiltiies of changing their VSGs in such an environmental niche to best suit their survival as a whole. I was a bit curious of whether the tissue-dependency of this organism could be affected by different tissue types and extravascular conditions? For instance, would meningital tissue and extravascular spaces in the cranium feature a different response than enteroid tissue in the gut, and extravascular spaces there?

Not only did confirm a lot of speculations that were proposed in prior studies, but it also highlighted a lot of new information about an aquatic environment (ie. brackish biomes) that has not previously been elucidated. It is intriguing that the transitions of bacterial communities both into and out of brackish bodies have glossed over in the field despite such type of environments taking up such a large portion of global waters. Some strong points of the paper that I noticed was that I liked how for the most part the figures in the paper were properly explained in the written portion and that the conclusions drawn were easily traced back to the data in the figures. It made going through the findings of the study a pretty straightforward process. In addition, I liked how you acknowledged the missing information from this experiment in your discussion section, such as exactly why transitions were more frequent into than out of brackish biomes. These kinds of acknowledgements paves the way for future research to build off of this study and come up with answers to these gaps in knowledge. In the end, you mention that ""phylogenomic analyses should be supplemented with experimental and ecological approaches"" in future studies, but what exactly did you have in mind? One suggestion I had was maybe repeating the experiment in other brackish bodies of water such as the Black Sea/Salian Sea to see if the results can be reproduced?

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.27.497797v1#comment-6021551985,biorxivstage,0,"Summarize the (at most) 3 key main ideas. The three key ideas I gathered from this paper were – 1.	Extravascular spaces appear as an important and previously overlooked niche for antigenic variation in T. brucei infection. 2.	Extravascular-resident T. Brucei play a profound role in the longevity and persistence of T. brucei infection by exhibiting novel immune evading VSGs. 3.	Extravascular spaces potentially facilitate antigenic variation by providing parasites extra ‘time’ to reside in the same. Main contribution of the paper This paper highlights the role of the extravascular spaces in enhancing and or prolonging T. Brucei infection. This is a novel finding because previous work on T. Brucei has barely studied antigenic variation in extravascular spaces. Most studies have been conducted on blood resident T. Brucei. Claims that state that T. brucei populations residing in the blood fully represent the antigenic complexity of T. brucei populations have been falsely passed on. Consequently, this paper helps break such false beliefs. Besides breaking false beliefs, the importance of this paper is further highlighted in the introduction section which states that most T. Brucei parasites reside in the extravascular spaces during T. Brucei infection. By providing a rationale over why they do so, this paper helps guide effective strategies to eliminate T. Brucei infection. Now for example, researchers are more likely to focus on preventing the entry of these parasites into the extravascular spaces since it is these spaces which provide the parasites their key pathogenic mechanism and or strategy. Critique One of the claims researchers make to explain how extravascular spaces help enhance and or prolong T. Brucei infection involves the immune system. The researchers specifically claim that extravascular spaces provide the parasites additional time to carry out antigenic variation. While the researchers have provided an immunological basis for this hypothesis of theirs (by including the IgM antibody), I do feel that it still too far-fetched. It could be the extensive VSGs found in the extravascular spaces provide parasites additional time to carry out more antigenic variation rather than the extravascular space itself providing the parasites additional time to carry out antigenic variation (through blocking IgM). To solidify their IgM hypothesis, perhaps they can block the IgM antibody of mice and then infect them. This way the additional time earlier enjoyed by only the extravascular residing parasites can also be enjoyed by the blood resident parasites. If blood-resident parasites in this condition just like the tissue-resident parasites start to demonstrate higher antigenic variation, then this can provide support for the researcher’s claim that the tissue’s provision of extra time is what makes the parasites undergo more extensive antigenic variation within the extravascular spaces. It is important to note that the researchers in this study made use of a specific model of T. Brucei. They used T. brucei EATRO1125 AnTat1.1E 90-13 parasites which are incapable of developing into their short stumpy forms (McDonald et al., 2018). This appears risky since the short stumpy forms of the parasite enable it to undergo apoptosis and cell death. Hence it could be that the parasites continued existence in the tissue could be due to their inability to undergo apoptosis rather than the VSG itself. This definitely poses challenges on the main contribution of the paper which associates prolonged T. Brucei infection to VSGs and antigenic diversity.   Hence while using this cell line helps researchers account for antigenic variations which are independent of development, it also likely causes continued parasite pertinence due to the inability of the same to undergo apoptosis. Surface proteins like VSGs which serve as key players in host-pathogen interactions are often subjected to strong selection pressures resulting in rapid evolutionary changes through mutation, recombination, and gene duplication. Consequently, studying VSGs repertoires is very challenging and I wonder how the researchers ensure the initial stability of VSGs for comparison post antigenic variations. Significance While I do think that the finding is novel and hence significant, I believe that the researchers can do a better job in explaining the applicability of this finding in the field of vector biology. There also exist some issues (model of the parasite used) which may make one skeptical about the paper’s main contribution and hence significance. Methodology I believe that the experiments were well-designed. This is because they made use of appropriate and highly accurate reagents and techniques. For instance, after obtaining the tissues from mice who had been infected with T. Brucei infection, the tissues were treated with TRIzolTM LS to obtain RNA. Usage of TRIzolTM has long been considered the “gold standard” for RNA purification. The all-in-one reagent can lyse extremely complex samples, is easily scalable, generates and or recovers ample RNA yield and is also effective in inactivating RNAses. This way the researchers ensure that they preserve the RNA quality, integrity, and quantity. To get rid of any contaminating DNA researchers also make use of DNases This prevents their sample from being contaminated and hence ensures the integrity of their data (and therefore claims). Additionally, the researchers also make use of the Mag-Bind Total Pure NGS which refers to a reliable solution used for the purification of both DNA and RNA for next-generation sequencing workflows. The technique enables the researchers to selectively bind fragments thereby providing the flexibility of left, right or double-sided size selection. The purified RNA generated post this technique is suitable for a variety of downstream applications such as NGS library preparation, microarrays, automated fluorescent sequencing. Knowing that the researchers use such a reliable technique to purify and select their RNA gives me confidence over some of their results such as the one presented in the abstract – the expressed VSG repertoire is not uniform across populations of parasites within the same infection. Following extraction of the RNA from the extravascular tissue post T. brucei infection, the researchers then obtain cDNA from the RNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase and a primer that binds to the conserved VSG 14-mer in the 3’UTR. Using the enzyme Superscript III reverse transcriptase to carry out the reverse transcription definitely serves to be advantageous. This appears to be an effective strategy since the particular enzyme has been modified to have a higher half-life, higher thermal stability, and reduced RNase H activity. Furthermore, using primers that specifically bind to the VSG gene enable, the researchers to obtain cDNAs of VSG. cDNA’s reflect expressed genes and obtaining the same for VSG hence helps provide researchers an idea of the extent of VSG expression. Post obtaining the cDNA the researchers then subject the same to 25 rounds of PCR using VSG-specific primers that contain a Phusion polymerase. Use of such a polymerase definitely serves advantageous since, the polymerase brings together a novel Pyrococcus-like enzyme with a processivity enhancing domain. This enables the generation of PCR products with accuracy and high speed which is something previously unattainable with single enzymes. This further adds to my believability of the results since the reagents chosen to appear to be high quality and error aversive. Once the PCR products are obtained, they are then quantified using QuBit HS DNA kit which is a kit that enables accurate and precise quantification of dsDNA. The resulting DNA which represents VSG genes present in extravascular tissue post infection with the parasite, are sequenced using Illumina sequencing which is a high-throughput sequencing technique. Consequently, through using high-throughput, modern and accurate techniques, the researchers definitely make their data appear accurate. Using these techniques also helps the researcher’s study both the genetic and epigenetic bases of antigenic variation. Antigenic variations often occur by altering the DNA sequence of an antigen encoding gene or the regulatory elements. The changes then cause alterations in the expression levels of the antigen.  Since the researchers in this study not only sequence the VSG specific genes but also obtain and quantify the cDNA extracted from the RNA of TRIzolTM incubated extravascular tissue, this method enables them to assess both and account for both the genetic and expression level changes that associate with the genetic basis of antigenic variations. In fact, this method even enables the researchers to account for the epigenetic variations of antigenic variations. During epigenetic variations, antigenic variations manifest as changes in their expression levels as opposed to changes in their genes. Hence even if sequencing data shows no changes which may lead to the assumption of no antigenic variation, coupling this method with cDNA acquisition and quantification, definitely enables researchers to account for the epigenetic basis of antigenic expression by providing the researchers a chance to study changes in expression levels (Cortés & Deitsch, 2017). According to (Stockdale et al., 2008), three key things are required for antigenic variation. The first requirement includes the need for a family of genes encoding antigenically distinct surface antigens. T. brucei contains more than 1000 VSG genes. Through having access to those genes using VSG-specific primers, PCR, and sequencing and that too of extravascular tissues post the parasite’s infection, this technique enables researchers to assess antigenic variations in extravascular tissue. Another requirement for demonstrating antigenic variation includes the need for a single pathogen to express one variant antigen gene at a time. This prevents the over exhaustion of the surface antigens repertoire. Through extracting and quantifying cDNA which represent genes which have been expressed post extravascular T. brucei parasitic infection, the researchers can assess the same as well. The third and final strategy needed to achieve antigenic variation includes a mechanism which enables the microbe to switch the single expressed antigen gene. T. brucei appears unique in that it actually acquires two mechanisms to achieve those switching. The first mechanism involves a single antigen gene being expressed and then being periodically silenced with another gene being activated. This can be assessed by the chosen method since it makes use of cDNA analysis. The second strategy used relies on recombination. Specifically, there exist a site for antigen gene expression. Switching to new antigenic variants is achieved by recombination into the specific site. Often times a silent antigen gene is copied and duplicated into the expression site deleting the resident gene. I am not exactly sure how the method helps researchers study such form of homologous recombination. Perhaps researchers can further venture into this. Most important limitation I believe the most important limitation of this study is the utilization of a model of T. Brucei which is incapable of undergoing apoptosis (due to the model’s inability to form short stumpy bodies). Since the entire study focuses on assessing parasitemia and relating the same to antigenic variation, how do researchers control for the effects of reduced apoptosis on the parasitemia? Another important limitation I would like to highlight is that involving the data presented in figure 5. The data in this figure is generated by the researchers testing for unique VSGs generated on day 6 in the blood. I wonder why this is the case. This is because in an earlier section, the researchers specifically mention that they did not assess for unique VSGs in day 6 since there were too few VSGs generated at the time. This makes me a bit skeptical about the results generated in day 6 since the data for the same in the context of unique VSGs was never presented. Another question that arises is why the authors specifically chose to study day 6 VSGs and exclude day 10 and 14 VSGs for this analysis. I believe that some rationale could be provided to better understand this choice of the author. Writing I would give this paper a score of 4 for its writing. This is because I genuinely feel that the researchers were able to communicate complex ideas in a simplistic and comprehensible manner. However, I think that certain terminologies such as tissue tropism, and certain concepts such as immune evasion could be further explained, since the audience may not have much science background. While I did not find any grammatical errors, I do think the researchers should keep track of the claims they make. For instance, in one section of the paper, the researchers wrote that they did not assess unique VSGs on day 6 since none were generated by then. However later onwards when describing the findings presented in figure 5, they stated that they assessed/looked for the unique VSGs on day 6 in the blood. These two statements appear contradictory and makes one skeptical over the writing and hence the overall study. Any questions the work leaves open? In this study the researchers find what they like to call unique VSGs. Unique VSGs are VSGs only expressed in certain spaces. I believe that the researchers can further expand on their study by assessing the role of these unique VSGs in tissue tropism. If the identified VSGs do play a role in tissue tropism, this can significantly uplift the impact factor of this research study given that tissue tropism changes during the course of infection and hence potentially serves a diagnostic tool. For instance, acute Toxoplasma gondii infections associate with gut cell invasion whilst chronic disease is characterized by brain invasion and neurological impairment. Trypanosome tropism towards the central nervous system causes a variety of sleep disturbances, psychiatric, motor, and sensory malfunctions. Hence understanding the potential of those unique tissue specific VSGs in T. brucei specific tropism can definitely improve the applicability of this particular paper. In this paper, the researchers show that majority of antigenic variation takes place in the extravascular spaces. It would be interesting to evaluate the survivability of the blood-resident VSGs prior to extravascular invasion using in vitro studies. This could potentially enable drug development which prevents the entrance of T. brucei into the extravascular spaces. In this study, the researchers only study VSGs for up to 14 days. At this point according to the researchers, tissue-resident populations only begin to diverge from one another and the blood. Studying longer periods of VSG expression can definitely help the researchers further address their aim of studying the role of extravascular parasites in T. brucei infection. I wonder why the researchers choose to only study 14 days post infection. Are there any limitations that restrict them for studying T. brucei for longer periods of time. The researchers in this paper also discuss about tissue-specific VSG selection. This seems to make quite a lot of sense. This is because other parasites like Plasmodium do express different var genes Besides studying for tissue-specific VSG selection, researchers in this study can also study the role of VSGs in things other than antigenic variation. According to Silva Pereira (20220, researchers are currently underestimating the extent to which VSGs are repurposed beyond their role as variant antigens. Indeed, there do exist nonvariant VSGs that perform specific functions such as serum-resistance associated VSG. To relate this future study with their antigen specific aims, they can assess how antigenic variations in VSGs evolve and or modify VSGs to carry out other unique functionalities. The researchers in this study discuss the applicability of their findings in the context of natural infections. They specifically claim that the variations can help the parasite survive in wild animals who may already have anti-VSG immunity. However, I feel that to improve the generalizability of the research’s findings to humans, researchers can assess if these antigen variation strategies enable the parasite to survive longer in a vaccinated human already acquiring VSG active immunity, nonvaccinated human already acquiring VSG herd immunity or infant already acquiring anti-VSG passive immunity. This can definitely be an interesting arena to look into.",2022-10-24T23:55:58,ShreyaJolly,Shreya Jolly,10.1101/2022.06.27.497797,Extravascular spaces are reservoirs of antigenic diversity in Trypanosoma brucei infection,"Alexander Beaver, Nathan P.

I felt that your abstract and introduction requires additional information to understand the paper.

Additional information on fin whales would have also been nice to better understand their behavior not in the context of song.

Your paper on random subcloning was a fun read! It's a similar result to MacArthur's Broken Stick model for species-abundance distributions, and a cool analysis. While the maximum fragment length has high variance under the null hypothesis you consider elegantly in random subcloning, it does not have high variance under engineered infectious clones. The statistic ends up being elegant because not only does it contain information on regular spaced-ness of the restriction sites, but it also relates directly to the bioengineering constraint of plasmid stability. If we assume the probability of prohibitive plasmid instability increases monotonically with fragment length, longest-fragment-lengths give us a meaningful lower-bound on the probability a given infectious clone is synthesizable. Consequently, we chose maximum fragment length as our summary statistic of the restriction map to capture both even-spaced-ness and synthesizability, believing this would be the best statistic (if we had to choose just one) for identifying infectious clones. That said, we're fascinated to see what future work lays ahead, and believe it's likely better statistics and classifiers of infectious clones may exist, although with such a small sample size it's also quite easy to dredge the data and so we chose one statistic very carefully & stuck with that in our work here.

I’ve often read about this topic before, but this was a really novel take on the topic of antimicrobial resistance. Beginning with the introduction and abstract I thought there was sufficient background information provided on why this topic is important,  and why it is relevant to study today. In addition, it was also clear to me what the goal of this paper was (studying the effects of ARM-1 on Mfd). However, I would have preferred to see a little more background information on the Mfd compound. I understood how it operates to produce mutations, but I wish this compound was expanded upon a little more. Perhaps including some information on whether this compound is only seen in bacteria, and if not, are there any analogs in other organisms? Moving on to the first experiment, this was the only part of the study I had a little trouble understanding. I understood the underlying mechanisms that displayed the relationship of Mfd to the RNAP molecule, and how the ARM-1 compound thwarts this relationship. I just wish a little more context was provided as to how you arrived from 43 hits to ARM-1. When focusing on the next three figures presented I think that these were all done very well. I will, however, suggest for figure 2 perhaps splitting up the figure into two separate figures/parts. The first part containing information for figures 2A and 2B, and the next part containing information for figures 2C and 2D. I suggest this because the two halves of figure 2 discuss information that deals with separate topics. I thought that figure 3 was very clear and displayed your findings quite well!

In comparisons of slightly more distant relatives, one could not really see the inversions but we saw an X-like pattens of conservation.
