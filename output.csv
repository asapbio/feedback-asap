https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.20.683404v1#comment-6793299565,biorxivstage,1,"Dear authors, at first, congratulations to this important findings. This data, paired with other ancient DNA evidence, can further clarify the demographic patterns of the peopling of Eastern Eurasia and Oceania, as well as their interactions with archaic human groups. Different deeply branching Denisovan components associated with multiple distinct introgression events, are useful additional data points for the possible migration routes and or population substructure scenarios. In your pre-print, you argued for a possible earlier southern route into Oceania, followed by a later wave of the ancestors of South Asians (AASI) and East Asians, with East Asians via a possible northerly route: ""This supports an early migration of the ancestors of Oceanians through South Asia followed by the later arrival of the ancestors of present-day South Asians. East Asians do not share this Denisovan component in their genomes, suggesting that their ancestors arrived independently, perhaps by a northerly route"". One major problem with this scenario is the observed genetic affinity between the different ""basal Asian"" populations (e.g. Tianyuan, Önge, Hoabinhian, Xingyi_EN, Jōmon/Shiraho_27k, AASI, and Australasians/Oceanians such as Papuans); also known as ""eastern non-Africans"" (ENA) or ""East Eurasian Core"" (EEC). The aDNA data strongly suggest a single dispersal route and subsequent rapid diversification into multiple basal Asian lineages (presumably in the South-Southeast Asia region via a Southern route). E.g. Oceanians/Papuans can successfully be modeled (qpAdm/qpWave) as simply Önge-like + additional Denisovan; or alternatively as Tianyuan-like + additional Denisovan. They do not fit as outgroup to ""West/East Eurasians"" either, but are nested within the ""Eastern"" clade. Similarly, present-day East Asians derive most of their ancestry from an Önge-like source, thus could not have arrived there as distinct group by a different route than them. Although it is possible to reproduce a signal affilated with a distinct earlier southern coastal route (proxied by ZlatyKun_45k); this wave however left only minor ancestry among present-day Oceanians/Papuans (and or South Asians), with the majority ancestry of them being derived from the same source as Önge or Tianyuan: e.g. ZlatyKun + Önge-like + extra Denisovan, in a 3–13%, 84–95%, and 2–3% ratio respectively. This means that present-day eastern non-Africans (ENA) descend primarily from a single migration wave eastwards, presumably via a route South of the Himalayas; and which possibly absorbed an earlier less successfull wave, at least regionally (Oceania and South Asia). This may also have happened via a more substructured wave: e.g. both a southern coastal and a southern interior route through South Asia (along the coast of the Indian subcontinent, and via interior routes through India) into Southeast Asia and beyond. Regional Denisovan admixture events (or their partial absence as in the case of Jōmon HGs [see the recent paper by Jiaqi Yang et al. 2025 ""An early East Asian lineage with unexpectedly low Denisovan ancestry""]) can be explained that way, without needing several different routes, which would contradict the observed genetic affinities of the different Basal Asian lineages. Note that Tianyuan40k can successfully be modeled as Önge-like + IUP-affilated admixture (BachoKiro_IUP); which fits the presence of IUP material sites in nearby NW China and Mongolia. Such IUP admixture has also been noted to explain the observed affinity to the GoyetQ116-1 specimen in Europe, which similarly can be modeled as Kostenki14/Sunghir_UP + BachoKiro_IUP (see Hajdinjak et al. 2021 ""Initial Upper Palaeolithic humans in Europe had recent Neanderthal ancestry""). It is possible that this Siberian IUP group absorbed the EA-specific Denisovan component and via its admixture into Tianyuan, contributed it to other Eastern Asians in lesser amount. – Present-day East Asians in turn can be successfully modeled as Tianyuan-like (c. 25%) + Önge-like (c. 75%); (see McColl et al. 2018 ""The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia"" for example). Alternatively, the primary ancestral source of all eastern non-Africans (ENA) used a northern route through Central Asia/Siberia (e.g. = Siberian IUP), followed by a deep split into Tianyuan-like and ""southern ENA"" branches. The Tianyuan-like group absorbed the EA-specific Denisovan ancestry, while the ""southern ENA"" headed into Southern China, where they absorbed the SEA/shared Denisovan component. – One branch of the ""southern ENA"" likely split prior to this archaic introgression, heading to the Japanese archipelago (being partly ancestral to the Jōmon HGs [Shiraho_27k?], with low or nearly no Denisovan ancestry). For more information on the Shiraho_27k specimen, please contact your co-author Svante Pääbo. After the archaic introgression, the ""southern ENA"" further diversified: one branch became ancestral to the Önge, the Hoabinhians, and the major source of present-day East Asians respectively, as well as the supposed Tibetan Ghost (Xingyi_EN). Such Önge-like ancestry also headed into South Asia, absorbing a possible earlier southern route group and deep Denisovan ancestry = AASI; the same applies for the group heading into Oceania and becoming ancestral to Papuans (Önge-like + deep Denisovan + possible minor earlier wave). A possible Tianyuan->Han->Önge->Papuan cline was also noted by Lazaridis et al. 2018; supplementary information. You can also review Bennett et al. 2024 ""Reconstructing the Human Population History of East Asia through Ancient Genomics"", a recent summary paper on the peopling of Eastern Asia and beyond; as well as Tianyi Wang et al. 2025 ""Prehistoric genomes from Yunnan reveal ancestry related to Tibetans and Austroasiatic speakers"". Although the demographic history of Eastern Eurasia is not the main topic of your paper, it is related to the inferred migration routes discussed in your paper, and a relevant additional information; perhaps for future papers, combining aDNA, archaic introgression events/components and archaeologic and environmental data, to present a better picture on the demographic patterns of Paleolithic Eurasia. A summary of my points regarding your postulated ""earlier southern route"" for Oceanians: • The available genetic data strongly suggests a single shared migration wave for the primary ancestral source  of all eastern non-Africans (Papuans, AASI, East Asians, Önge/Hoabinhian, and Tianyuan), regardless of via a Northern or Southern route. The presence of multiple deeply branching EEC lineages in Southeast Asia and southern China suggest it to be a major place of diversification from a shared ancestral source. • Papuans/Oceanians (and AASI) may have limited amounts of admixture from an earlier (southern route) wave, but primarily share ancestry with Önge and Tianyuan. • Tianyuan can be modeled as either an admixture between Önge-like (61–67%) and BachoKiro_IUP-like (33–39%) ancestries; or represents a deep split from the rest of eastern non-Africans, staying in the North. • Ancient and present-day East Asians can be modeled as primarily Önge-like (c. 75%) with Tianyuan-like admixture (c. 25%). • The IUP-affilated groups, such as BachoKiro_IUP, appear basal to all eastern non-Africans (ENA), but share more affinity with them than West Eurasians (Upper Paleolithic Europeans; Kostenki14 etc.) do. [See also Vallini et al. 2022 and 2024]. – Ust'Ishim forming a ""near trifurication"" although sharing a short period of evolutionary drift with the ENA/EEC clade. • The different Denisovan introgression events, if not shared, happened regionally to explain the observed affinities, but differences in Denisovan components.

(Önge = ONG Mondal; Jōmon = JpOd181/274/282). E.g. it is not likely that Oceanians used a distinct earlier wave into Oceania, separate from other mainland Asian groups. Next to qpAdm/qpWave or qpGraph models, f3/f4 statistics are quite clear on this. Papuans are (beyond their extra Denisovan ancestry and possible minor ""earlier group"" admixture) nested in eastern non-African diversity (e.g. EEC). I hope this information can help to tangle out some possible scenarios on the dispersal, contact and introgression events for the different deeply branching Denisovan components and present-day Asian populations. I am looking forward for the publication of your paper and more exciting findings! Thank you. Yours sincerely, Yamashita Tatsuya",2025-11-07T10:51:52,tatsuya_yamashita,Tatsuya Yamashita,,,,

Neither the title nor the Abstract tells us the species under study (mice). The first mention seems to be in Methods. The Introduction does not specify the animal species used in the literature cited (mostly rats, I suppose). Some of the literature citations are erroneous. Here, I focus on two sentences, as follows. ""Nicotine is another widely abused drug that both acts on dopamine circuits and has been widely shown to decrease food intake (Iravani, 1972; Passey et al., 1961; Schechter & Cook, 1976)."" This sentence requires qualification. Any effect of nicotine on food intake will depend critically on the dose, on acute vs. chronic administration, etc. These three literature citations fail to support the above statement: Iravani 1972 exposed rats to cigarette smoke, not to nicotine per se. It is hardly surprising that the rats lost weight in this 1972 study, as they were reported to show sniffing and sneezing, with post-mortem examination revealing airways filled with ""highly purulent fluid"". It seems unlikely that this study would obtain ethical approval these days. Passey et al 1961 is from a charity campaign document, which I could not find online and is almost certainly not peer-reviewed. Schechter & Cook, 1976 actually reported the opposite of what is claimed here. This earlier study also used a very high dose of nicotine (0.8 mg/kg expressed as base). Such a dose is near the threshold for producing seizures, and would have given plasma levels of nicotine approximately 10 times higher than in smokers. There are probably dozens of solid papers that could have been cited on nicotine's effects on feeding behaviour in laboratory rats. Not all of these studies suggest that nicotine reduces food intake, especially at doses that might be smoking-relevant. ""As with amphetamine, nicotine’s effects on feeding under normal ad libitum feeding conditions has been broadly studied, but its potential effects on the rewarding and motivational qualities of food are unknown."" This is a puzzling statement. There are numerous reports of nicotine effects on operant responding for food. Are such studies not relevant?",2025-11-05T12:07:34,disqus_459cgkF2ai,Paul Clarke,,,,

Congratulations on this interesting contribution to the taxonomy and biological control of psyllid pests.

I apologise for the self-reference, but given the biogeographical proximity and the relevance of the Israeli Tamarixia fauna to the region, it was somewhat surprising not to see it cited. In Israel, we have documented five native species of Tamarixia, including T. dorchinae, which shares several morphological characters with what you describe as T. citricola, particularly in forewing and antennal structure across sexes. A comparative discussion of these taxa might offer further insights into whether the specimens from Cyprus are truly distinct species. A discussion comparing the putative new species with other taxa in the region is warranted anyway. Additionally, I think that host specificity in Tamarixia isgenerally more consistent  with psyllid host genus rather than the associated plant. This ecological pattern may be worth emphasizing in your discussion. We are in the process of barcoding the Tamarixia species of Israel, and a comparison with your material would be most useful.

All sites contested by Bruttel et al -- those differing between SARS-CoV-2 and one or more of BANAL-20-247, BANAL-20-52, and RaTG13 (Fig 3A) -- are found in closely related genomes. The opposite is expected if these sites were engineered. 2. Equivalent fingerprints can be found for both of the non-bat, SARS2-like, sarbecoviruses (pangolin viruses MP789/Guangdong and P2V/Guangxi). These are both natural genomes. 3. BsaI/BsmBI sites in SARS2 are not anomalously ""evenly spaced"" when correcting errors made by Bruttel et al and when using a more appropriate metric (coefficient of variance of fragment lengths). One obvious error is dividing 1 by 1429 to obtain 0.07%; 1429 is equal to 71*(6 + choose(6,2)) i.e., the total number of restriction maps generated and not the number ""within the ideal range of 5-7 fragments."" I also note that ""5-8"" fragments turns into ""5-7 fragments"" half way through the manuscript. Things I do not address in my new preprint that are worth noting here: 1. I did not reproduce the ""all enzymes"" analysis because this is irrelevant to the ""IVGA fingerprint"" criteria. 2. Like Bruttel et al, I did not investigate whether all sticky ends were unique when calculating significance of the site distribution. 3. I did not reproduce the analysis of mutation rates and types (last two rows of Table S2). First, this is irrelevant because it's very likely that none of these sites are mutated from the most recent common ancestor with recently sampled bat coronaviruses. Second, this is inappropriately circular analysis since the sites were already identified as being different from RaTG13 and BANAL52; of course they will have a excess concentration of differences. Third, these are not ""mutations"" because SARS-CoV-2 did not evolve from RaTG13 or BANAL52 by ""mutation"". The null hypothesis is nonsensical. I also did not address point ""f"" in the ""IVGA fingerprint"" -- ""Two unique recognition sites may flank regions meant to be further manipulated."" -- because it is based on false information. Bruttel et al wrote, falsely, that a 2017 paper reported a method ""enabling efficient manipulations of the flanking region without having to reassemble the entire viral backbone for each variant."" This is false because: 1. The substituted fragment in the 2017 paper was not flanked by BsaI sites in the resulting construct (pBAC-CMV-rWIV1); BsaI sites were not retained in the assembly. 2. There is a BsaI site in the BAC backbone (pBeloBAC11) that is retained. 3. There are 5 BsaI sites in WIV1 that were retained. There was no need to remove them because they occur in fragments that were not digested with BsaI. Of course, one-pot Golden Gate assembly protocols require removing backbone sites to combine restriction digestion and ligation into a single step; but this is not one of them since it is a modification of a previous system, Zeng et al 2016, that used BglI, SacII, and AscI.",2025-10-31T09:55:08,zach_hensel,Zach Hensel,,,,

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.23.684102v1#comment-6789090018,biorxivstage,0,"A fundamental principle of enzyme kinetics is that the microscopic rate constants for substrate association (kf) and dissociation (kr) cannot be elucidated from steady-state data alone. The reason is that once the enzyme-substrate (ES) complex reaches a steady state, the individual forward and reverse steps of its formation become masked in the overall bulk reaction velocity. Consequently, determining kf and kr necessitates pre-steady-state kinetic measurements. This is intuitively clear when considering two hypothetical enzymes with identical kcat and kcat/Km values but different underlying kf and kr. Such enzymes would produce indistinguishable Michaelis-Menten plots (V vs. [S]), making it impossible to discriminate between their microscopic constants based on steady-state data. The authors' highly mathematical approach appears to overlook this foundational constraint. Beyond this conceptual issue, several methodological choices raise concerns regarding the biological relevance and interpretation of the simulations. 1. Violation of Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) Conditions (Page 6) The authors state that initial concentrations s0 and e0 were sampled from intervals Is=[Km/5,1.5Km] and Ie=[Km/50,0.5Km], claiming these adhere to QSSA conditions. However, a critical requirement for the standard QSSA is that the substrate concentration greatly exceeds the enzyme concentration (s0>>e0), typically by two orders of magnitude. This ensures that substrate depletion due to ES complex formation is negligible, allowing the free substrate concentration to be approximated by s0. The chosen intervals, where e0 can be as high as 2.5 times s0 (e.g., s0=0.2Km and e0=0.5Km), severely violate this condition. Therefore, the subsequent simulations and analyses do not accurately model a conventional steady-state experiment, where the QSSA is valid. 2. Unrealistic Kinetic Parameters and Confounded Results (Page 8) In the sensitivity analysis, the authors compare two scenarios: •	(i)   kf=0.500 nM−1s−1, kr=0.005 s−1 •	(ii)  kf=0.005 nM−1s−1, kr=0.500 s−1 The ratio kr/kf defines the dissociation constant (Kd). For scenario (i), Kd=10 pM, representing an exceptionally tight, nearly irreversible binding event that is thermodynamically implausible for a productive enzyme-catalyzed reaction. In contrast, scenario (ii) has a more reasonable Kd of 10 µM. More critically, these scenarios are again simulated with e0 comparable to s0, invalidating the QSSA. Furthermore, the two parameter sets result in different Km values (approximately 10 nM and 300 nM, respectively). The different substrate decay curves shown in Figure 1 are therefore a direct result of different enzyme saturation levels (s0/Km ratios), not a unique sensitivity to kr. If the simulations were repeated with identical s0/Km ratios and appropriately scaled timeframes, the substrate decay profiles would be indistinguishable. This confounding factor also explains the reported low sensitivity to kr: when kr<<kcat, the value of Km becomes insensitive to changes in kr. Conclusion In summary, this work does not demonstrate that microscopic rate constants kf and kr can be derived from steady-state parameters Km and kcat. The simulations were conducted under conditions that violate the assumptions of Michaelis-Menten model, and the presented results appear to be confounded by differences in enzyme saturation. The parameter sets were selected in a manner that produced the desired outcome rather than exploring a biologically realistic parameter space. Ultimately, these findings indirectly reinforce the established consensus: obtaining microscopic rate constants requires pre-steady-state kinetic analysis Alessandro Pesaresi CNR, Institue of Crystallography, Trieste alessandro.pesaresi@cnr.it",2025-10-29T12:24:49,,Alessandro Pesaresi,,,,

Monovalent siRNA was mentioned multiple times, which was confusing because the project is focused on divalent siRNAs. There were many times where it said to “see above” but it was unclear where to look. In addition, Figure 1 is unclear and needs additional labeling. The text says Chol-TEG s1 is monovalent, but that is not indicated in the figure.

For example, it was described as “any wells with cell death or rounded cells were noted.” Clarification on how authors determined if the cells underwent cell death or if they were rounded is needed. In addition, the generated mouse line description is unclear. Are the C57BL/6 mice replaced with human locus? The generation of the mice used for the experiments is not described sufficiently. Specifically, the transgenic mice were back crossed until generation 5; however, the following section discussed using generation 3 and 6 for transgene mapping. Furthermore, how much murine DNA was removed and how much human DNA was inserted? Is it the same chromosomal location? In addition, there needs to be a better explanation on how the targeted siRNA dose levels were chosen, simply saying “determined by UV absorbance” is not enough. The administration of divalent siRNA to mice was unclear. Why were two different types of anesthesia used?

Using fetal bovine serum in human pancreatic tissue slice cultures introduces xenogeneic components that compromise physiological relevance. Human cells are exposed to bovine proteins, immunoglobulins, cytokines, and growth factors they would never encounter in vivo. This is especially concerning for immune cell studies, where bovine mediators may inappropriately activate or suppress human macrophages and T cells, producing non-physiological responses. Species differences in growth factor-receptor interactions can alter signaling pathways and gene expression, creating artifacts that don't reflect authentic human biology. For mechanistic studies and therapeutic evaluations, maintaining species-appropriate culture conditions is critical.

My second point concerns 'mixotroph'. From the tone of the discussion on this point, I assume you refer to photo-phagotrophy, as undertaken by mixoplankton. The problem with 'mixotroph' is that diatoms are strongly mixotrophic, via photo-osmotrophy (a trait well studied back in the 1960's etc. and exploited in algal biotech). I suggest that you consider using 'mixoplankton' to identify those organisms which are photo-phagotrophic. Checking organisms against the contents of the Mixoplankton Data Base of Mitra et al.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.14.594221v1#comment-6785383363,biorxivstage,0,"This study by Bento et. al (2024) revealed that both Anopheles mosquitoes and plasmodium parasites are influenced by rhythms that have evolved to synchronize in order to optimize infection and transmission timing within the hole. Researchers asked whether the biological clocks helped the organism anticipate blood meals and modulate, parasite behavior, which would ultimately affect malaria transmission. There are three primary findings in this paper. The first finding was that roughly half of the mosquito salivary gland transcriptome exhibit 24 hour rhythmic expression. The expression peaks occurred twice daily once early in the day and once early in the night, which alliance with the gnome mosquito feeding patterns. These changes persist in both light/dark (LD) and constant darkness (DD) conditions. This was an indication that the genes in the salivary glands were driven by an internal circadian clock rather than by light cues or environmental factors. The second finding is that the Plasmodium sporozoite in the salivary gland also show cyclic transcription, that included cells involved in motility and host cell invasion. The authors ruled out the possibility that the observed rhythmic expression could be due to changes in sporozoite numbers due to replication or migration. After using immunofluorescence to visualize sporozoites at specific time points and testing for DNA replication, they found no evidence that replication explained the cyclic patterns. These results strengthened to idea that both mosquito and parasite are synchronized by daily cycles. Lastly, the found that mosquitoes are more likely feed at night and ingest more blood. Mice infected with sporozoites at night show higher liver parasites loads than mice infected during the day, indicating that sporozoites more infective at night. Together, these results suggest that the mammalian host, Plasmodium parasite and the Anopheles mosquito have evolved coordinated daily rhythms that maximize transmission success. The paper’s central contribution is the discovery that both the Anopheles mosquito vector and the Plasmodium parasite operate under circadian control and that their biological rhythms are synchronized to optimize malaria transmission. A critique that I would give to the main contribution is that experiments use Anopheles mosquitoes and Plasmodium berghei (a rodent malaria model). While appropriate for a controlled lab setting, it does not fully represent human malaria species or the natural mosquito environment. Conducting similar experiment in the future on human malaria parasites and field collected mosquitoes would strength relevance to the human population. If I were to write the significance of the paper on a 1-5 scale, I would give it a 4. It provides an important discovery with clear implication for control strategies. Overall, the methodology is mostly convincing. The researchers sampling every 4 hours, replication cross LD and DD conditions and combined transcriptomic and proteomic approaches provide a strong support for the presence of rhythmic gene expression. However, I have some questions about the results. The paper shows differences in expression levels between LD and DD conditions. What explains the discrepancies. This study would benefit from more discussion or experiments that addressed the source of LD and DD differences. Also, not all genes within the sporozoite showed clean cyclic patterns. For example, p52, CS, and AMA-1, displayed irregular or weak oscillations. It would be helpful if the authors addressed whether their irregulars reflect true biological variability or something external among the sporozoites. Also, a direct manipulation of clock components would strength the link between salivary gland genes and sporozoites. The most important limitation is generalizability. This study’s experiments focused on rodent-parasite/mosquito system under controlled conditions. This makes it unclear whether the observed data of rhythmic gene expression operates identically in natural setting with human malaria species and diverse mosquito environments. I would rate the writing 3/5 for clarity. The method’s section was dense and difficult to follow in some parts. There were technical terms and procedural details that were not fully explained for a non-specialist reader. For example. algorithms were named (e.g., ARSER, JTK_CYCLE), but a brief, plain-language description of what each contributes would help readers unfamiliar with circadian statistics. Also, some of the figures lacked proper labeling so it as hard to interpret what the data without having to refer back to the paper.  However, the abstract, introduction, results and discussion were readable and logically organized. Overall, the paper reframes malaria as a time-dependent system in which the vector, parasite and host rhythms are important for infection and transmission. Practical implication includes creating strategies that uses this knowledge such as insecticide spraying, bed-net use or prophylactic drug delivery to disrupt transmission timing. Moreover, this study can extend to other vector-borne disease such as Zika and dengue. Ultimately, this research contributes to the growing appreciation that temporal organization is central to biological function.",2025-10-21T05:01:38,beatrice_opoku,Beatrice Opoku,,,,

Your work provides remarkable insight into how circadian rhythms influence malaria transmission, connecting parasite, vector, and host biology in a way that could reshape how we think about disease timing and control strategies. One question I have is regarding the difference in the number of peaks and the timing of peak expression activity between the mosquitoes and the sporozoites shown in fig. 1F and fig. 3C. I’m interested in what you make of the discrepancy. Why might it be advantageous for sporozoites to have a peak expression in the early morning while most of the Anopheles activity occurs. The fact that the peak expressions are synched between the sporozoites suggests that they are synched by external stimulus. However, for an immature parasite that likely lacks photoreceptors and was raised under constant temperature, I’m really curious what type of stimulus could affix or synchronize its circadian rhythm.

And finally, the study not only explains why the measles vaccine is safe and long-lasting, but also gives useful insights for designing new live or IFN-sensitive vaccine platforms. That said, there are still a few details that could be improved. For example, in Figure 1a–b, it’s not very clear why the authors only used TECs and PBMCs as models instead of including other cell types. It’s also not explained why they only collected the supernatant from TECs but measured both the supernatant and cell fractions in PBMCs. In Figure 4, the macaque experiment only shows viral RNA and cytokine changes in BAL and PBMCs, but lacks tissue-level analysis like immune cell infiltration or histology. Lastly, the study doesn’t really discuss the adaptive immune response, which is important since long-term immune memory is a major feature of the measles vaccine.

The abstract in this paper is very clear as it provides both background information and key findings. One thing I suggest is considering adding a short summary of methods used so the audience can get a basic idea about how you study the mechanisms of circadian rhythms. For the method section, I have some questions: 1)Why do you choose to dissect the salivary glands of mosquitos every 4 hours instead of with other time intervals? Are there previous studies or specific mechanisms in mosquito biology that support 4-hour interval is most optimal for this study? 2) I think other factors such as moisture and temperature may also play a role in altering circadian rhythms in mosquitos. Have you considered incoporate those factors in future studies? If so, how will you control them in a laboratory setting? 3) For this study, is it necessary to include a group of uninfected mosquitos as control? I think it'd be better to have them so you can have a baseline to compare with because circadian rhythms may be affected by the parasites.

Typical diploid organism experimental design studying a specific genotype for expression involves using a homozygous wild-type (+/+), heterozygous mutant with one copy of the allele (+/-), and a homozygous mutant with the gene knocked out (-/-). This study only utilized Arabidopsis ahk5-1 (Col-0) as their homozygous mutant and compared the treatment with the wild-type homozygous Arabidopsis. Why was the heterozygote not included in the study? Is there any phenotypic difference between the WT and the knockout strain? Growth rates, appearance, stress tolerance, etc.? If the AHK5 gene is critical in signaling during stress, there should be a phenotype of deficient stress tolerance. The experimental design also did not involve replicants or parallel experiments during the metabolic labeling procedures Another problematic issue is the type of water used. During the treatment stage, the control “mock” treatment added an equivalent amount of water to the seedlings but does not specify the type of water (i.e. DI water vs. tap). Later, after incubation of the treatment methods, the seedlings are rinsed specifically with tap water. Components of tap water vs. DI water can have differences in mineral content and affect the protein extraction results. The protein extraction procedure was modified where instead of grinding in a mortar and pestle as per procedures established2,3, the liquid nitrogen frozen plant matter was coarsely crushed. The reasoning for this was not established. During the proteome quantification procedure, hits to contaminants were excluded. Why was this?

The authors present a coherent body of evidence showing that LAMV, unlike wild-type measles virus (MeV), triggers an early, robust type I interferon response (dominated by IFN-α) in primary human PBMCs; this response correlates with a post-entry block in infectious particle formation. The experimental program is broad and well-integrated: bulk RNA-Seq, targeted protein analyses (TBK1/IRF3/IRF7/STAT1), cytokine profiling, functional IFN pathway blockade, reverse genetics and validation in rhesus macaques.Using a combination of primary human PBMCs, differentiated rhesus tracheal epithelial cells, reverse genetics, and an in vivo macaque model, the authors show that LAMV uniquely triggers an early and robust type I interferon response dominated by IFN-α in immune cells. The data are coherent across molecular, functional, and animal-model levels and together provide a compelling model that innate immune activation rather than an inherent replication defect is the dominant driver of LAMV attenuation. The study has several notable strengths. It is a multi-layered experimental design.Use of primary human PBMCs and an in vivo macaque model is especially important, since the attenuation phenotype is largely invisible in immortalized cell lines that have compromised interferon responses. The integration of genetic (mutation) data with host-response profiling produces a clear and translationally relevant mechanistic narrative that is likely of interest to both virologists and vaccine developers. The paper shows that innate IFN responses tied to specific mutations drive attenuation has broad implications for rational live-vaccine design and safety considerations (including immunocompromised hosts). It is not a paradigm-shifting discovery for immunology generally, but it is a significant, field-advancing contribution to vaccine virology. There is however one concern that I have is that, although macaque experiments add in vivo relevance, intratracheal infection may not fully model the subcutaneous/intramuscular context of human vaccination; additional delivery-route experiments would bolster translational claims. Overall speaking about the format , the preprint is well organized and easy to follow and the Methods and Supplementary files provide sufficient technical detail to reproduce the core experiments. Figures are logically ordered to match the results narrative, and most figure legends succinctly summarize what is shown.This paper suggests a shift in thinking about live-attenuated vaccine design attenuation can be achieved deliberately by engineering viruses to induce targeted innate responses (especially type I IFNs) while retaining sufficient antigen expression to drive durable adaptive immunity. That concept could guide rational design of next-generation live vaccines or adjuvant strategies.Overall, this is an important and timely study that links viral genetics and host innate immunity to vaccine attenuation.",2025-10-19T16:17:06,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,,,,

Here are our highlights: The authors combine small DNA motif signatures with larger pan-genome features to predict antibiotic resistance, outperforming models that use only target motifs or only genome-wide features. This dual model demonstrates improved generalization across multiple bacterial species. The approach also evaluates the relative predictive value of individual motifs.",2025-10-18T14:27:48,evolutionaryhealthgroup,Evolutionary Health Group,,,,

The clear structure of abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion made it easy to follow the logical flow of the study. I especially appreciated the formatting and figure legends, particularly Figure 3, which made the results very intuitive to interpret. The results section also aligns well with the visual data, which helped reinforce your conclusions. If I may offer a small suggestion, it would be to provide brief explanations of some technical terms in earlier sections. As someone outside the field of ecology, I found concepts such as Hill numbers (q = 0, 1, 2) and their relationship to α-, β-, and γ-diversity or TD/FD/PD facets a bit difficult to grasp on first reading, even though the discussion later clarified them well. It might also help to elaborate slightly on the ecological roles of deadwood and canopy density in shaping forest structural complexity and why these features are particularly relevant to spiders. Overall, the paper is clear, well-written, and thoughtfully presented. The points I’ve raised are minor and come mainly from the perspective of a reader less familiar with ecological terminology. Thank you for sharing such a well-organized and insightful piece of work.",2025-10-18T00:58:34,,CDSL,,,,

Using rigorous in vitro and in vivo models, the authors demonstrate that, unlike wild-type measles, LAMV infection of primary human immune cells induces a potent innate response driven by IFNα, effectively inhibiting viral replication and spread. Furthermore, by co-infection of PBMCs and rhesus macaque cells, they clearly demonstrate that LAMV can enter cells and initiate transcription but is unable to produce progeny virus, consistent with its robust innate sensing capabilities. One question is how these acute innate signals influence vaccine immunogenicity: the authors note that LAMV also triggers rapid release of proinflammatory cytokines in PBMC cultures and rhesus macaques, which may contribute to the initiation of adaptive immunity. It would be helpful if the authors could elaborate on whether and how the early IFNα and cytokine responses they observed contribute to the long-term protective immunity elicited by LAMV (e.g., by enhancing antigen presentation or memory formation). Overall, this well-executed study provides a compelling mechanistic framework explaining why LAMV is both safe and highly immunogenic, and the proposed elucidation will further strengthen the link between innate responses and vaccine efficacy.",2025-10-17T18:35:43,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,,,,

I think the authors connect molecular biology, ecology, and evolutionary reasoning into one story is very great, showing that fungal effectors may have originated from ancient antimicrobial proteins. And the tool AMAPEC is well designed, and it is the key method in this research. Also, the narrative is clear, well supported by data. One small suggestion would be to strengthen the evolutionary argument with more structural or functional validation. Since the conclusions rely heavily on computational predictions, additional experimental evidence, especially under natural microbiome conditions, in this way, it could make the findings even more convincing.",2025-10-17T01:12:16,cdsljhsph,CDSL JHSPH,,,,
