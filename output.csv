https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.03.551751v2#comment-6379643007,biorxivstage,3,"[NOTE: This preprint was discussed in the Journal club of Texas Biomed in Jan 2024. The listed comments are the result of that discussion] Summary It has been implicitly assumed that all mosquitoes, carrying Plasmodium sporozoites (SPZs) in their salivary glands (SGs), are infectious to their mammalian hosts. One recent study (Aleshnick et al. 2020) challenged this assumption by showing that the probability of mouse infection per a single mosquito bite increases with the number of SPZs the mosquito carries in the SGs. Here, authors extend this previous work to investigate how the number of SPZs in the salivary glands relates to the number of oocysts in the mosquito's gut and to the number of SPZs that mosquitoes expelled during probing on artificial skin. The authors went through many experimental steps to rigorously quantify the SPZ number (in mosquito and expelled) and the number of intact and ruptured oocysts. Authors also used two different ways to generate SPZs in mosquitoes - by feeding the mosquitoes blood culture of gametocytes and by feeding mosquitoes on blood from Plasmodium-infected individuals. While previous work focused on murine Plasmodium species, this study looked at human parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) that is likely to be more relevant to human malaria. The results are in line with several previous findings: the number of SG SPZs correlates with the number of oocysts and with the number of SPZs expelled into the skin, and mosquitoes with more oocysts have SPZs in SG earlier. Positive feedback There are many things to like about this paper. Although the question is not new, the authors approached it with high rigor of experimental design and performed many troubleshooting analyses (many of the latter are shown in Supplement, e.g., Fig 8). The experimental procedures are well described and problems associated with the data are mentioned. The analyses performed are mostly straightforward. A combination of different techniques (dissection, microscopy, PCR) provides a more comprehensive understanding of system. Studying human malaria parasites is important, and measurements done for mosquitoes fed on cultured gametocytes and on blood from P. Falciparum-infected volunteers are very interesting. Major comments 1. The authors performed some basic statistical analyses but, in some cases, the choices of the models used were not clearly justified. For example, for looking at relationships between oocyst density and infection, authors used logistic regression. In correlation analyses, spearman rank correlation was used. Why were those the right choices? Using linear regression (Pearson correlation) could be more sensitive to trends, Deming regression is more appropriate when there is an error in both variables, and using alternative models to look at relationships between oocyst density and SG SPZ number, or SPZ number and expelled SPZs could reveal useful information (e.g., for different alternative models see PMID:  32453765). 2. Additional points regarding statistical rigor/analyses. What is exactly oocyst density and infection prevalence (Fig 1B)? How can oocyst density be <1? Is that an average per several mosquitoes? This is not well explained. At 100 oocyst density there are still not 100% infections - how is that possible? Is that because time of sampling is too early and SPZs did not yet develop? Perhaps structuring the data on time since feeding could reveal interesting patterns. Also, analysis of binned data (e.g., Fig 2A and others) is not a good way to analyze data because answer may depend on binning choices (e.g.,  17960243). Finally, presenting results when excluding mosquitoes that did not deposit SPZ as main result is incorrect as this likely introduces bias. 3. Generating calibration curve and determining threshold for estimating the number of SPZs in the sample is important. How did you generate the dilutions of the SPZ numbers and how did you make sure that you had 100k vs. 5 in other samples? Did you count the 5 SPZs or was that estimated? If estimated, did you take into account errors with the dilution? I wonder if plotting the data using a log-log plot and doing a linear regression analysis would be useful for Fig 1A. Also, for Suppl Fig 2A, how many samples are the curves based on? Should that be plotted for every sample analyzed? 4. While I appreciate the generate a robust artificial skin model, I wonder how realistic is using artificial skin with blood. In real skin, mosquitoes must probe to find the blood vessel while with the artificial skin, mosquito may find blood every time of probing - could that bias the results in some ways? 5. Previous work established the importance of probing time and unimportance of taking the blood meal for infection (32453765). What were these parameters in your experiments and could they explain difference in how SPZ numbers in SG relate to number of expelled parasites? 6. The finding that there is not ""threshold"" in the number of expelled parasites with SG SPZ number is interesting. What if you assume that infection occurs only if the number of deposited SPZs is above some critical number - will then you able to ""match"" the threshold model found previously (32453765)? 7. One interesting mosquito had 9 ruptured oocysts but only about 2k SPZs - how is this possible? Where are the other SPZs? Could it be that they are in the “missing” parts of the salivary glands? That seems unlikely. 8. The authors have very rich dataset but did not make conclusions that could be also interesting. For example, how many SPZs are made per oocyst given these data? What is the summary of maturation process from these data? Having a cartoon with steps and quantifying them (e.g., what is the efficacy of transfer of SPZs from gut to SG?) could be very useful (e.g., as Figure 6 or as graphical abstract). 9. In their sporozoite quantification assay, the authors used the COX1 mitochondrial gene target. This gene is typically present in multiple copies in eukariots. However, it is not mentioned anywhere in the manuscript how many copies of the gene are present in the P. falciparum mitochondria. It is also not mentioned nor tested if all the different populations of P. falciparum used in this study have the exact same COX1 copy number. If they share the same copy number, then the sporozoite quantification assay presented is indeed robust. However, if this number of copies varies between P. falciparum populations, and moreover, within a population, then the quantification assay will lack robustness. In such cases, it would have been more valuable to use a single-copy nuclear gene. Could the authors provide more information regarding the COX1 copy number in P. falciparum and check that this number of copies is consistent across all populations? 10. When looking at the Methods section, I realized that the authors have used two different populations of P. falciparum to infect their An. stephensi: NF54 from West Africa and NF135 from Cambodia. When measuring the duration of the EIP, the authors stated that '…mosquitoes were fed with P. falciparum NF54 and NF135 gametocytes…'. Did the authors infect their An. stephensi mosquitoes with a mix of these NF54 and NF135 gametocytes, or did they infect each batch of mosquitoes with one parasite population (i.e. either NF54 or NF135)? If they infected each batch of mosquitoes with one parasite population, why is this not reflected in the text and on the figures? Did one population produce more oocysts and sporozoites than the other? If the authors mixed NF54 and NF135, what is the rationale for doing this? I suspect these two populations also vary in their ability to produce gametocytes. Did the authors observe recombination between the two populations? Also do An. stephensi mosquitoes exhibit the same host-parasite compatibility/co-adaptation with both populations of parasites? If not, this could be a possible explanation for the weak correlation found between the total sporozoite load and the sporozoite expelled. I suggest that the authors carefully clarify these points, as it is quite confusing at the moment in the present manuscript. Minor comments 1. Because of very large difference in SPZ numbers, plotting the data on log (or log-log) scale would help to see the data scatter better. Also, perhaps in some cases highlighting  ranges of oocysts and/or SPZ number in SG that are ""realistic for the field"" (e.g., by using gray boxes) could be useful. 2. The authors could calculate the total number of SPZs in the mosquito and the skin which is better than that done in previous study that calculated residual SPZ number in SGs (32453765). However, would any conclusions that look at correlating SG SPZ number with other parameters change if you consider the remaining SPZ number rather than total per mosquito (e.g., Fig 2A, 3A/C, 4B, etc)? 3. In Fig. 1D: What is the rationale for comparing mercurochrome staining of oocysts at day 8 with anti-CSP immunostaining at day 18? Why not compare both stainings at both time points (i.e., mercurochrome at day 8 and immunostaining at day 8, as well as mercurochrome at day 18 and immunostaining at day 18)? Otherwise, it's challenging to compare different staining methods at different time points and draw robust conclusions about the number of oocysts present. 4. In their discussion, the authors never mentioned that potential co-evolution between hosts and parasites could explain why they observed a tighter correlation between total sporozoite load and sporozoites expelled in the context of the infection conducted in Burkina Faso. Indeed, for this experiment, naturally circulating P. falciparum parasites were used to infect their sympatric host, An. coluzzii. However, this is not the case for the lab experiment, where two geographically and genetically distant parasites (i.e., NF54 from West Africa and NF135 from Cambodia) were used to infect An. stephensi, Nijmengen Sind-Kasur strain, which originates from Pakistan and has therefore not coevolved with either of these parasite strains. 5. In Fig. 2B: When examining the EIP, authors chose to assess the number of sporozoites per mosquito at days 9, 10, and 11 post-feeding with gametocytes. They also looked at the number of sporozoites in a single oocyst and compared these numbers at days 9 and 10. Why not also investigate day 11, as they did for the EIP? Do the authors know the dynamics of sporozoite growth in an oocyst? Does it exponentially increase until the oocysts burst? Does it reach a plateau at some point and then burst? It would be very interesting to explore these aspects. 6. I did not see that the data are made available. Per FAIR principles ( https://direct.mit.edu/dint..., the data should be shared with the community so they can be further analyzed.",2024-01-30T21:38:19,vitalyvganusov,Vitaly V.

Strengths: (1) As opposed to opioids, SSRIs and NSAIDs, the usage of targeted senolytics to clear senescent osteoclasts addresses chronic pain at the cellular level. This provides a new modality among the available treatment regimens. (2) This is one of those articles where we see the promise of molecular medicine. The RNA primer selection was highly relevant and specific for neuronal development, differentiation and metabolism. These served to accurately assess the relationship of spinal hypersensitivity and the mechanism of action of senolytics. Additionally, this research helped to further tease apart the signaling pathways associated with senescence and senolytics. Weaknesses: (1) With regards to the sham group, there is a possibility that detachment of the posterior paravertebral muscles from L3-L5 possibly induced a level of mechanical instability. To mimic the stress of surgery in the sham group, saline injections into the paravertebral muscles could mimic the muscular disruption of surgery without inducing spinal instability. (2) Inclusion of a non-surgical ""sham"" group, female mice, and surgically altered, aged mice, in the control set would be helpful in identifying the mechanism of drug action. (3) Although mice are not bipedal, it may be helpful in preparation for the use in humans to evaluate the L5 and S1 endplates as well since the L5/S1 endplates are more likely to be degenerative in adults than L4/5. (4) It was difficult to assess the behavioral effects since there was no baseline prior to surgery, after surgery and before the administration of navitoclax. (5) Additionally, in studies moving forward, the risks and benefits of the systemic side effects of navitoclax should be evaluated.",2024-01-26T22:14:47,juliatrevorrow,Julia  Trevorrow,10.1101/2023.10.26.564218,Senescence of endplate osteoclasts induces sensory innervation and spinal pain,"Dayu Pan, Kheiria Gamal Benkato, Xuequan Han, Jinjian Zheng, Vijay Kumar, Mei Wan, Junying Zheng, Xu Cao",2023-10-26

The color glass filter used is not specified, and its performance is only characterized within a small range of wavelengths, which limits the fluorophores that can be used and the total number that could be used in this system, unlike some of the previous methods. It can of course be a strength that fluorophores in a small spectral range can be used for 2(to-4?)-plex imaging instead of having to use well-separated fluorophores which have wildly different photophysics, so that potential limitation is not in any way fatal.

Currently, the time is cut off at about 400 seconds, shortly after the beginning of the dissociation phase of the measurement, whereas the other figures all extend out to around 1300 seconds. Usually, the reason for including sensorgrams in a published article is to convince the reader that the regression fit curves (red) approximately overlay the data curves (blue-green).  If the shapes of the curves match, then it's a visual confirmation that the model fits the data, and that the -log10(KD) values obtained from the regression are therefore trustworthy.  In figure 8, with the latter ~900 seconds of data missing, it's more difficult for the reader to make that determination. This is important because it's later shown in figure 24 that antigen 6 apparently gets some of the best results of the entire study.  Compared to figures 19-23 and 25-26, the antibodies designed against antigen 6 have both the largest total number of binding affinities extending beyond the reference (i.e. largest number of dots above the line), and the highest affinity -log10(kD) values appear to extend farthest past the reference as well (i.e., the dot values along the vertical axis go farthest past the line). A key conclusion stated in the abstract (that the IgDesign tool can produce ""improved affinities over clinically validated reference antibodies"") rests on the premise that the tails of the affinity distributions plotted in figures 19-26 can sometimes extend past the reference line.  However, if it turns out the -log10(KD) values aren't reliable to begin with, due to a poor regression fit result, then this conclusion is weakened or possibly even invalidated.",2024-01-22T20:56:44,,Anonymous,10.1101/2023.12.08.570889,In vitro validated antibody design against multiple therapeutic antigens using generative inverse folding,"Amir Shanehsazzadeh, Julian Alverio, George Kasun, Simon Levine, Jibran A.

The paper aims to advance structure-based drug design by using serial crystallography to study room-temperature ligand-bound structures of the soluble epoxide hydrolase protein and discussing the implications for drug discovery. The major success of the paper lies in its innovative approach to microcrystallization and the use of serial crystallography, which allows for detailed room-temperature structural analysis. This technique provides a more dynamic picture of protein-ligand interactions, as evidenced by the observed potential temperature-dependent differences in ligand-binding modes and the improved resolution of flexible loops. The primary limitation of the method is the extended data collection time (1-2 hours).The paper does not fully explore the potential for reducing data collection time for these highly redundant datasets. Major Points 1 - Data Collection Time: The data collection time of 1-2 hours is unusually long. The discussion could focus more on the prospects for reducing this time. An example is in the high redundancy in the “Table 1”. It would be beneficial to see an analysis of data subsets or suggestions for online processing to determine the minimal data collection time needed for viable interpretation. The paper could elaborate on the potential for automation in this method, especially given the lack of ""looping"" in the process that would help trade off for some of this concern. 2 - Indexing Rate Variability: The paper should address the variability in indexing rates between different compounds. Understanding and explaining this variability is crucial for the broader application of this method. 3 - Comparative Literature: Other papers discussing RT ligand binding differences could be cited, including recent works: - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih... - https://elifesciences.org/a... 4 - Visualization Improvements in Figure 7: A correlation plot or residue plot in Figure 7 would provide a clearer visualization of the differences and regions of increased flexibility at room temperature. 5 - The improved resolution of certain regions is not entirely unexpected (Fraser 2011 has other examples). The authors may be interested in reading Halle's study (PNAS 2004) on cryocooling for reasoning why the loops may be more ordered. 6 - Interpretation of Compound Five: The conclusion about the change in pose for Compound Five requires further clarification. Detail the different refinements that led to this conclusion, considering alternative explanations like reduced occupancy should be presented.",2024-01-22T05:41:51,fraserlab,Fraser Lab,10.1101/2023.12.21.572778,Exploring serial crystallography for drug discovery,"A.

We agree that these signals should not be treated with ICA. For irregular FPs this is generally unnecessary. Now, statistical independence cannot be used as a generic argument, it must be measured whenever possible (e.g., modeling work), as was done in Makarova et al 2011). In practice, most users of ICA in EEG, fMRI, and intracranial FPs corroborate this (Bell and Sejnowski doi: 10.1162/neco.1995.7.6.1129.). The argument used here in l66-l68 that Glabska's modeled FP study only found ICA components of two populations in cortex is flawed. There are two errors. First, FPs are not population specific, but pathway-and-population specific. Any population can produce as many ICA components as input pathways produce FPs, which requires incoming activity to be coherent and spatially discrete distribution over the morphology of individual cells. Indeed, Torres et al (doi: 10.1093/cercor/bhz061) found some more components in cortex, but only two were local and have significant variance, others were minor and discarded for further consideration. Importantly, only a few populations in the brain have the appropriate geometry to produce FPs, which is the reason why they do not provide any IC, as has already been shown by several groups, including the authors themselves in previous detailed studies of cortical activity (see Herreras O doi : 10.3389/fncel.2023.1129097 and doi: 10.1093/cercor/bhac297). On the other hand, populations that do not generate FP do contribute MUA, so their aliquot part of MUA should be subtracted so as not to introduce error in any analysis that combines FP and MUA. That is probably unfeasible in experiments. Hope this helps better founding the study context.

I would like to state the following facts: 1. The GX_P2V virus has been published in Nature in 2020 (doi: 10.1038/s41586-020-2169-0). It is not a brand-new virus. 2. The GX_P2V(short_3UTR) mutant was published in Emerging Microbes & Infections in 2022 (doi: 10.1080/22221751.2022.2151383). This cell-adapted mutant is the actual isolate published in the Nature paper. So, the original GX_P2V virus was not isolated. Clearly the original GX_P2V virus in the pangolin sample has severe growth deficiency in Vero cells. 3. The GX_P2V virus is not a human pathogen, although, based on molecular and animal infection experiments, it can infect a broad spectrum of host species, like human, cat, pig, golden hamster, mouse, rat et al. There is no evidence of the original GX_P2V virus circulating in these animals, not even consider this GX_P2V(short-3UTR) mutant. Please refer to publications: EMBO J, doi: 10.15252/embj.2021109962 and J Virol, doi: 10.1128/jvi.01719-22. 4. The GX_P2V(short_3UTR) isolate is highly attenuated in in vitro and in vivo models. In Vero, BGM, and Calu-3 cell lines, the virus induced only mild cytopathic effects, notably failing to produce viral plaques even on the human lung cell line Calu-3. In golden hamster and BALB/c mouse models, the virus can infect the animals' respiratory tracts but did not result in any observable disease symptoms. The attenuated nature of GX_P2V(short_3UTR) was also validated in two distinct human ACE2-transgenic mouse models. Please refer to publications: Emerging Microbes & Infections, doi: 10.1080/22221751.2022.2151383 and J Virol, doi: 10.1128/jvi.01719-22. The attenuation of GX_P2V(short_3UTR) was also hinted in the Nature paper on the GX_P2V(short_3UTR) isolate (doi: 10.1038/s41586-020-2169-0). In Extended Data Figure 1, after infecting Vero cells for five days, GX_P2V caused noticeable cytopathic effects, but which were limited to cell rounding and mild cytolysis, which starkly contrasted with the severe cytopathic effects reported in SARS-CoV-2. 5. The public has developed a high level of population immunity against GX_P2V due to SARS-CoV-2 immunizations and infections. Collectively, the biological safety risk posed by GX_P2V(short_3UTR) is extremely low. I don’t think there is any immediate risk of spillover into the human population. Please refer to publication: J Med Virol, doi: 10.1002/jmv.29031. 6. Based on previous reports on ACE2 humanized mouse models with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, there is significant variability in the outcomes of infection in these models, a topic extensively documented in the literature. A single ACE2 humanized mouse model does not constitute a reliable paradigm for evaluating viral pathogenicity. While GX_P2V(short_3UTR) proved lethal in our mouse model, it's important to consider that it did not cause disease upon infecting two other distinct ACE2 humanized mouse strains. The findings reported in this paper do not alter the fundamental nature of GX_P2V(short_3UTR) as being highly attenuated. 7. Several other research groups have repeatedly reported the spillover risk of this virus based on its spike protein binding to human ACE2. Those reports have not caught much attention. In our study, using a unique lethal model, we inadvertently reinforced the perception that this virus has a strong tropism for human brains and causes 100% mortality. We need to revise this in the subsequent revision of the paper and provide additional clarification on the intrinsic attenuated nature of the virus. 8. The GX_P2V(short_3UTR) mutant is a promising live attenuated vaccine against pan-SARS-CoV-2.

The overarching aim is to create a global trophic pyramid of biomass, partitioned by food source. The authors collected a large dataset on diet composition from the literature and other sources, ensuring a broad taxonomic spread. They then estimate diet partitioning for major taxonomic groups (~class) by averaging species-level data, and further estimate partitioned food source biomass by multiplying with class-level biomass estimates. This is taken to be provide a representation of a trophic pyramid, and the findings are discussed in the light of this concept. The major claim of this study is that they find a middle-heavy trophic pyramid, with invertivory more prominent (by biomass) than herbivory. The study pursues a very interesting question in studying the trophic pyramid on a global level. The authors have invested a lot of effort in compiling a large dataset on species-level diet partitioning, and such a dataset would certainly be very valuable for species-level comparisons and analyses, such as the taxonomic distribution of feeding styles or the evolutionary history of feeding specialisations. However, such questions are not the focus of the present study. Rather, an attempt is made to convert this species-level dataset into a trophic pyramid of food source biomass. In the process, the authors make several sweeping assumptions and generalisations, resulting in analyses that are not at all well supported by the underlying data. First, the conversion of species-level data to class-level partitioning of food sources, by averaging the data from available species, assumes that the compiled species are representative of the group (class) as a whole, and that a simple species average would provide a meaningful group average. Both are highly doubtful and not supported by any data. Second, the assumption is made that the class-level partitioning of food sources can be transformed into a partitioning of diet biomass by a multiplication with that group’s estimated biomass value. However, this will yield the biomass of that specific partition (e.g., the combined bodymass of all vertebrate herbivores) and not the biomass of their diet. Third, species groups (and their biomass) are assigned to a trophic level by their food source type, which leads to the three categories “herbivores” (= primary consumers), “invertivores” (= secondary consumers) and “vertivores” (presumably considered as predators including apex predators as they are placed at the top of the pyramid in Fig. 2). This is a strong oversimplification and does not represent a trophic pyramid. Most worryingly, the category “invertivores” will lump many higher-level consumers (third-level, fourth-level…) into the secondary consumer category, which as a result has by far the highest proportion (= biomass in this analysis). Thus, one of the key claims of the study, that the global trophic pyramid is middle-heavy, is likely due to a methodological artifact. In summary, the study attempts a methodological shortcut for deriving a trophic biomass dataset from species-level data, without verifying the assumptions. At the current time, there appears to be no ready substitute for species-level abundance or biomass data. Until such data are available for the majority of organisms, analyses of trophic pyramids on a global level may be premature. Recommendations for the authors: As mentioned in my public review, I commend the authors on compiling such a large and potentially very valuable dataset on species-level diet partitioning. I believe such a dataset can be very informative for species-level analyses, or possible investigations into the evolution of such partitioning. However, such a dataset cannot be transformed into a trophic dataset without corresponding data on species abundances and/or biomass. Your attempts to perform this transformation without such data unfortunately fall short, as it requires a series of sweeping assumptions that are almost entirely unfounded by real-world data. I will attempt to explain my views in the sections below: Title The title is misleading: in the current form, the manuscript deals with many more analyses than the number of herbivore and predatory species in each class. Though as I mentioned, this species-level analysis is actually the most relevant (and valid) analysis in your study while the trophic pyramid aspect is not. Introduction You provide a very nice overview of the different concepts of trophic pyramids and their development over time. As you point out, all these variants of the pyramid include a measure of scale for each level, such as ‘abundance’, ‘biomass’, or ‘energy’. It is also implicit in this introduction that this concept considers multiple levels (L42: “…food chains…”, L45: “…and so on up to…”) and not just three as in your following analysis. Materials and Methods The success of the method hinges on the representativeness of selected species. This is highly unlikely, as data on diet composition will be much more readily available for large or well-studied organisms, which are not necessarily the ones that are the most important (by number or biomass) members of their class. The authors themselves acknowledge that for many groups, even with a minimum of ~500 species per group, still only ~0.3 to 1.3% of described species are covered for insecta, arachnida, mollusca and crustacea (L265-267). In addition, I would strongly argue that even with good taxonomic coverage, as is achieved for birds and mammals, calculation of the group average has to consider the highly differing abundance and/or biomass of separate species. To illustrate these points, I would like to highlight the study’s data on the arachnida (Figs. 1 and 4). About 20% of their diet is considered as “parasite vertebrate”, with a considerable biomass. Without knowing the details of the species that were considered, I would assume that the majority of these are ticks, as these feed on (mostly) vertebrate blood. Roughly speaking, we know of maybe 60 000 species of arachnida, of which perhaps 1000 are ticks. On the species level, ticks therefore seem to be highly overrepresented in the dataset, possibly because it is straightforward to infer their food source from their specialized morphology. On the other hand, the group arachnida does not seem to consider very many oribatid mites, of which there are around 12 000 known species that are almost exclusively detritivore. In addition, oribatid mites are known to be extremely abundant in soils, so their biomass is likely many times that of ticks. A similarly obvious over-representation in terms of diet and biomass occurs in the marine dataset with “vertivore crustacea”. Please note that I only picked some obvious examples here, but that the same issues will be prevalent in all animal groups. Indeed, I believe that your method “validation” using bird species data shows that your estimate can be very unreliable, even for a well-covered group such as birds. Your Results (L345-347) show that “the respective contribution of invertebrates and vertebrates switched from 56% and 8% in the estimate to 23% and 45% in the species-weighted partitioning”. These are very large differences. A further point I would like to raise: using an animal group’s biomass to gauge the biomass of the separate diet partitions seems to oversimplify matters. You are assuming that the body biomass equals the diet biomass. However, foods have very different nutritional content (e.g., carbohydrates/protein/fiber). A Panda and a Polar Bear may have fairly similar body weights, but the panda needs to eat much more plant matter biomass due to the poor nutritional content. Overall, the Methods section is a little disjointed, and is difficult to match to the Results section. Also, some of the chosen methods are not well justified or explained. E.g., - How were Wikipedia sources selected and “confirmed” (L130), or how was the literature searched (L132)? - How did you incorporate a diet category that only exists for a single class (“plant-derived, L150”)? - How did you deal with separate diet data for juveniles and adults (L157)? - L184ff: It remains unclear why you compare your global dataset to two location-specific datasets. What did you aim to achieve? A validation of the global dataset in this manner appears dubious, as local datasets may always remain location-specific. - What is your justification for collecting a further dataset on dinosaur diet? You mention that you aim “to test if herbivory is related to higher body mass and lower metabolic rate” (L206), but then compile only diet data for these dinosaurs (inferred from dental morphology, adding a further level of uncertainty), and no data on body mass or metabolic rate. In addition, I would think that your dataset on mammal diet composition would be much more suitable for this purpose, as it appears to be quite comprehensive and would include many species with “high” body mass. Also, in extant mammal the diet composition has presumably been directly quantified, and not just inferred from dental morphology. - L214ff: Why have a specific method for assessing human diet? We are just one more species in your dataset. - L223ff: The use of reptile biomass data for amphibians is not justified. Your assessment that the differences in average body mass and population density ‘cancel each other out’ cannot be verified. If you do not have a good biomass estimate for amphibians, you cannot include this group in the analysis. - L265ff: Your statistical “validation” of achieving representative data from poor species coverage is inappropriate. By sampling 0.3% of bird species 10 00 times and calculating an average, you merely verify that you can calculate a good average from ~300 000 (~30 species x 10 000), overall randomly sampled, data points. To “validate” your approach, you need to investigate the variance of your 10 000 repeat samples, which presumably is extremely large. - L265ff: The Methods appear to be incomplete here, as the Results section describes an analysis that was weighted by bird species biomass and abundance (L340). Results Throughout the manuscript, but particularly noticeable in the Results section, you are using misleading terms to refer to your data and results. I believe this stems from your multiple assumption to derive trophic pyramid data from a species-level dataset. E.g. - Fig.1: “species in most animal groups”; this figure shows the group average diet composition, not the species proportions. - L355: “partitioning of diets… expressed as biomass (Fig. 2)”; this figure actually shows the biomass of the trophic group, not their diet. - Etc. L333: “we assumed a homogenous distribution of biomass across trophic levels in each group” – a further example of an unfounded assumption that weakens your analyses and conclusions considerably. The data on dinosaur diet is missing from the Results. Discussion As outlined above, I believe that your main conclusion of a middle-heavy global trophic pyramid is not supported by your analyses, as are other conclusions on the trophic pyramid. Your study does not support the conclusion of a “paradigm shift” (cf. L407). Finally, some further minor comments: L173: what is the category “Food I”, and why is it relevant to mention these categories here? L311: Conservation areas might include some “important species” that are missing elsewhere, but that should not distract from the fact that species lists remain highly biased and incomplete there, as everywhere. Most obviously, Kruger NP is bound to have more than 13 species of insect (Fig. S4). And certainly such species list do not consider the microfauna to a meaningful degree. L402: It seems very unfair to disparage previous efforts as biased, when your own study is based on highly incomplete datasets and unfounded assumptions. L476f: I find the definition of a carnivore from Román-Palacios et al. in this context highly misleading. Heterotrophs include fungi, which does not make a fungivore a carnivore. L494: There might have been larger insects in the prehistoric past (at least we know of one large dragonfly), but that hardly makes them “megafauna”. L523: “a world without insect would potentially mark the end of complex life on Earth” – there is certainly complex life in marine environments, where insects are not prevalent and their potential decline might not have large impacts. L676: “more abundant” – you are not considering abundance here. Fig. S8: Here you are literally comparing a species group with a single species (humans). I presume that your reasoning is that the diet of humans has important impacts on the global food web. This is a nice case in point that you absolutely need species-level information on abundance/biomass to construct trophic pyramids and food webs.",2024-01-16T14:43:15,,Reviewer1,10.1101/2022.09.14.507913,The trophic pyramid revisited: most animal classes have more predator than herbivore species,"Tamir Klein, Stav Livne-Luzon, Uri Moran",2022-09-16

We started this nearly 10 years ago. The counterintuitive observation that the sequence of CREs that are active in more tissues were less conserved than the sequence of tissue-specific ones needed a solid explanation. We started with an avalanche of sanity checks. Remapped everything, re-evaluated peak-calling, included dinucleotide aware divergence measures, re-checked alignments. After we were convinced that the signal would not go away, we needed to find an explanation. We started to look for an unbiased measure of TFBS binding potential and add RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data from comparing macaques and humans. Finally, the fog cleared up showing that pleiotropic CREs show a higer functional conservation. It is just that this functional conservation of these large pleiotropic CREs is achieved by redundancy, thus TFBS are moving around and different locations got fixed in different species: i.e. compensatory evolution within the same CRE. Compensatory evolution has been suggested before as a common mode of evolution for CREs, it is only that for less pleiotropic elements this usually happens not within the same element, but between different CREs, i.e. the entire CRE jumps around.",2024-01-12T11:13:24,ineshellmann,Ines Hellmann,10.1101/2024.01.10.575014,Evidence for compensatory evolution within pleiotropic regulatory elements,"Zane Kliesmete, Peter Orchard, Victor Yan Kin Lee, Johanna Geuder, Simon M.
